Verbs are not always used as infinitives. In order to indicate who is performing an action, we must conjugate the verb and provide its subject. To be and to have are the most common English verbs.

Add/Delete/Revise questions can be phrased in a variety of ways, but they all test essentially the same thing: whether information is relevant or irrelevant to the main topic of a paragraph or passage.

A) Because of the difficulties in controlling bees, a small proportion of any type of honey will come from a different nectar. B) The benefits of this treatment aren't just folklore: studies show that certain types of honey have anti-inflammatory properties. C) Despite varying regulations, the medical device market is projected to experience considerable growth in coming years. D) Topical honey can be used to treat both simple and complex injuries. Although these questions are phrased differently, they both test your understanding of counterarguments. What is the focus of the paragraph? The fact that honey has been used as medicine for thousands of years. What would be a reasonable objection to the example presented? Something along the lines of, \"But honey is such a common food! Can it really do all of these amazing things?\" The final sentence addresses (i.e., acknowledges and responds to) that possible reaction by suggesting that there is in fact scientific support for honey's healing powers.

Instead, notice that this answer focuses on how too much honey affects people, not on how honey is affected by something. It's a subtle but crucial distinction, and it allows you to eliminate A). B) No. Domesticated and wild bees are completely off-topic. C) No. Slightly off-topic. Being consumed by a wide range of species isn't quite the same thing as being affected by organic processes. Besides, the fact that honey will go bad if left unsealed does not logically follow from this statement. Even though the question does not explicitly instruct you to take into account the information that comes after, you must do so regardless. D) Yes.

For example, wolves may indicate dominant behavior by baring their teeth and pointing their ears forward. Subordinate behavior, on the other hand, may be indicated by closed mouths, narrowed eyes, and ears that are pulled back and held close to the head.

In fact, dealing with sentences like the ones on the previous page in context can often make things harder, not easier, because there is all sorts of other information present to distract you. For example, let's say you weren't sure about \\#13 (Many consider him the greatest jazz musician of all time). If you saw the following question, you might get stuck. In the decades since Armstrong retired from performing, his fame has continued to grow. Jazz fans and scholars now unanimously consider him one of the greatest jazz musicians of the twentieth 1 century, many consider him to be among the greatest jazz musicians of all time."}

By turning the camera on herself, Cindy Sherman established her reputation as one of the most respected photographers of the late twentieth century.

A parenthesis must be paired with another parenthesis, so A) and C) can be automatically eliminated. B) can also be eliminated because a semicolon can only separate two sentences, and contains a number of extremely modern neighborhoods is not a sentence. That leaves D), which is correct. Another potential error involves placing both commas and parentheses around a non-essential clause. As a general rule, either commas or parentheses should be used. Because these two types of punctuation signal non-essential information, it is redundant to use both. (The one exception is discussed below.) For example: The tower of 1 London, (a structure begun by William the Conqueror in 1078), is one of the largest and most imposing fortifications in England."}

A) places both a comma and a parenthesis at the beginning as well as the end of the non-essential clause; B) places both types of punctuation at the beginning of the non-essential clause; and C) places them at the end. The only grammatically acceptable answer is D), which does not include any unnecessary punctuation before or after the parentheses. Now we're going to make things a little harder. As discussed above, it is incorrect to use both a closeparenthesis and a comma for the sole purpose of marking the end of a non-essential clause. When a comma is grammatically necessary for other reasons, however, it is acceptable to place one after a close-parenthesis. For example, take a look at the following question: The tower of London was constructed as a prison in the eleventh century (the year 11078 to be exact); but over the centuries it has been used as everything from a treasury to an armory."}

No, that makes no sense whatsoever. In addition to being ungrammatical, it doesn't tell us who the Caribbean-American novelist is. The name is clearly essential here, so no commas are necessary.

When I moved into a new house last summer, however, I was thrilled to discover that there was enough space in the yard for a garden. There was just one problem - I'd never actually planted one.

When we cross out Jane, the resulting sentence (Luckily, that friend agreed to come over the next day) still makes sense in context because the writer has already referred to a friend in the previous sentence. The name Jane adds specific information about the friend, but it is not essential to the meaning of the passage. Commas are therefore necessary, making the answer A).

Webs allow spiders to catch prey without having to expend energy chasing it around. However, 1 it's a tiring dilemma because of the large amount of protein required, in the form of silk. In addition, silk quickly loses its stickiness and becomes inefficient at capturing prey. As a result, spiders often eat 2 it's own webs daily to regain some of the energy used in spinning. The silk proteins are thus recycled. 9. There are over 3,000 lizard species, but the Komodo dragon, a reptile with ancestors that date back more than 100 million years, wins the prize for being the largest living lizard in the world. 1 They're name came from rumors of a large dragon-like lizard inhabiting the warm, hilly islands of Indonesia. Indeed, the yellow color of its long forked tongue reminds people of a mythical fire-spitting dragon. Despite its ancient roots, the Komodo dragon was unknown to 2 them until 1910, when it was observed in Komodo National Park. 10. There are around 300 octopus species, all of which can change colors, squirt poison, and exert a force greater than that of their own body weight. In fact, 1 they're part of an elite group of marine creatures with remarkably large brains. Scientists have found that octopuses can not only navigate their way through mazes, but they can also solve problems quickly and remember 2 that."}

We inhabit a world of bridges. For thousands of 1 years, travelers, who needed to cross bodies of water, have been finding ingenious ways to do so. From the 3,000-year-old Arkadiko bridge in Greece to the brand-new 26.4 -mile structure connecting the Chinese port city of Quindao to 2 there suburbs, bridges are everywhere. The simplest type of bridge can be created by dragging a log over a creek, but the construction of modern bridges typically requires years of 3 education, today, architects, engineers, and artists may spend a decade or more working together to design a single structure. 5. In the world of airliners, bigger means better. The dawn of the jet age in the 1950s brought in the likes of the 1 Boeing 707; an aircraft capable of carrying more passengers more quickly than any propeller-driven design. Since that time, airliners have grown larger and larger. The sight of an Airbus A380 can still create great excitement. The 2 enormous double-decker plane can seat over 800 people. While the Airbus 380 is the largest passenger-carrying aircraft ever 3 built; it is dwarfed by another design that may someday take to the skies. With three decks for passengers, the AWWA Sky Whale looks like a cross between a tropical fish and a space shuttle from a science-fiction movie."}

Optical illusions reveal the human mind's tendency to make assumptions about the world - and what we believe 1 ones sees is often not the truth. For thousands of years, curious minds have questioned why our eyes are so easily fooled by simple drawings.

Tracking the flow of the water seems to \"tire\" some of the brain's neurons. When the person's gaze moves to the rocks, other neurons 4 overcompensate.

Machines are often blamed for stealing people's jobs. 1 Moreover, some machines actually create work. Technology can boost productivity, increasing the demand for labor. It can also streamline complex tasks, opening the door for less skilled workers. The American inventor Eli Whitney invented machines that did both. Whitney's most famous invention, the cotton gin, was patented in 1794. The 2 word, \"gin,\" is short for \"engine,\" and the cotton gin revolutionized cotton production by automating its processing. The device consisted of a set of wheels containing metal hooks. As the wheels turned, the hooks caught bits of cotton, pulling them through a screen that kept out seeds. 3 A wire brush periodically swept the cotton off the blade. This brush prevented the machine from jamming. Inland cotton 4 farmers, who could only cultivate \"green seed\" cotton - found the gin especially useful.

The fact that different answers contain different tenses is simply a distraction technique designed to make questions look more complicated than they actually are. # Subject-Verb Agreement At least one question testing subject-verb agreement is virtually guaranteed to appear on each test, so you should be familiar with the various ways in which disagreements can be constructed. These questions ask about verbs in the third-person singular (she/he/it/one) and third person plural (they) because these forms have the highest potential for confusion. The most important thing to remember about the singular vs. plural forms of a verb is as follows: - Singular verbs end in $-s$ (e.g., it makes) - Plural verbs do not end in $-s$ (e.g., they make) Note that this is the opposite of nouns, which take an $-s$ in the plural and no $-s$ in the singular.

The generators were quickly forgotten once fossil fuels became readily available, but over 50 years later, gasification was rediscovered 6,000 miles away as a potential source of alternative power.

Whether it's with a sympathetic tilt of the head or 1 an excited sweep of the tail, dogs often seem to be saying they can sense exactly what we're feeling.

In fact, a recent study found that dogs are able to distinguish between expressions that indicate happiness 2 and those in which anger is indicated. 4. First there was the frostquake.

Architects design buildings. Civil engincers build bridges. 1 Without structural engineers, everything could twist and shake apart. Their know-how is vital to mastering green construction's novel materials and innovative practices, whether used to harness the force of the wind or 2 capturing the power that the waves have. Green structures excite us by emphasizing particular goals - such as eliminating carbon emissions - and accomplishing them via potentially beautiful forms. Green structural engineers formulate new architectural questions and determine new criteria for evaluating the answers. 6. First popularized in Japan, Haiku is a form of poetry that has become appreciated around the world. Haiku poets are challenged to convey a vivid message in only 17 syllables. In Japan, these poems are valued for their simplicity, openness, and 1 being light. Haiku poems can describe anything, but they are seldom complicated or 2 people have difficulty understanding them. Each Haiku must contain a kigo, a season word that indicates what time of the year the Haiku is set. For example, blossoms would indicate spring, snow would give the idea of winter, and 3 summertime would be suggested by mosquitoes. The seasonal word isn't always obvious, though. Sometimes it is necessary to consider the theme of the poem to find it."}

When President James Polk officially confirmed 1 the discovery by James Marshall of gold at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California in 1848, hopeful prospectors immediately began planning for the trip out west. Beginning their journey in spring of 1849, 2 these prospectors took an overland route, known as \"fortyniners,\" that was risky and mostly unknown. Some fortyniners traveled alone, but most formed companies that enabled 3 them with other miners to share expenses and supplies during the long journey. Seagoing travelers went south to Panama by boat. After disembarking, 4 a several-day mule ride to the Pacific coast was begun.

T. Barnum. While still in his teens, Laliberté produced several performing arts events. After leaving college, he entered the world of street 3 performance, and he would play the harmonica and accordion on the streets of Quebec. He then 4 got together with a troupe that included firebreathers, jugglers, and acrobats who traveled around the country from show to show. Later, he returned to Quebec, where he found a steady job at a hydroelectric dam. Soon after his employment began, 5 however, the dam's employees went on strike. Laliberté took the opportunity to return to his life as a street performer."}

Sentence 2 also should not be placed before sentence 5 because sentence 5 introduces the fact that the fish was fermented, an idea continued in sentence 2. That eliminates C) and makes D) correct. 4. A: Logically, Hopper's second compiler should be discussed after her first compiler, which is mentioned in sentence 3 (Then, in the 1950s, she invented the compiler...). A) is the only option to place sentence 4 after sentence 3 , so it is correct. 5. B: Because paragraphs do not normally consist of a single sentence, you can start by assuming that both A) and D) are incorrect. B) is correct because in sentence 3, the passage shifts from providing general background information about Houston's experience with Inuit art to discussing the specific point (1953) at which Houston began importing Inuit art into the United States."}

A: The fastest way to answer this question is to look at the overall shape of the graph. There are two \"outlier\" points that rise notably higher than the others.

The title of the graph indicates that high bars correspond to high rainfall, so it is accurate to say that a strong El Niño corresponded to the wettest winters. B) is incorrect because the strong El Niño in 91-92 produced below-normal rainfall; C) is incorrect because the dark gray bars (weak El Niño) go up and down rather than up only; and D) is incorrect because the dark gray bars do not get closer to the light gray ones over time. 2.
