    "rationale": "The sentence 'The team collected numerous samples of flora and fauna' provides a concrete detail that supports the general statement in the first sentence about documenting biodiversity. It adds valuable information about the expedition's activities. Option B is incorrect; the sentence doesn't explain why the challenges were unforeseen. Option C is incorrect; it's not redundant, but rather a specific illustration. Option D is incorrect; while it mentions the team's work, it doesn't detract from the subsequent mention of challenges.",

Option B uses a semicolon correctly to join two closely related independent clauses. Option C correctly separates the two independent clauses into two distinct sentences. Option D uses a comma and a coordinating conjunction, which is also a correct way to join the clauses. However, option C provides a more direct and often preferred separation for clarity in this context.",

    "rationale": "The pronoun 'their' is plural, but it refers to the singular antecedent 'Each of the students.' According to traditional grammar rules, a singular antecedent requires a singular pronoun. 'His or her' is the correct singular pronoun to use. Option A is incorrect because it maintains the pronoun agreement error. Option C is incorrect because 'its' is used for inanimate objects or animals, not people. Option D is incorrect because 'our' is plural and refers to the speaker's group, not the students individually.",

'Practiced' and 'composing' are in the -ing form (gerunds or present participles used in a series). Therefore, the final item should also be in the -ing form. Option A is incorrect because 'to perform' is an infinitive and breaks the parallel structure. Option C is incorrect because 'performed' is a past tense verb and does not fit the parallel structure. Option D is incorrect because 'to be performing' is an infinitive phrase and also breaks the parallel structure.",

While not perfectly parallel in structure (gerund phrase vs. noun clause), the meaning and flow are acceptable. Option B is identical to the original and thus correct.

Option D changes the tense and structure of the second part, disrupting the parallel flow with the first part.",
