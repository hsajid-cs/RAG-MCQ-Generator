## An Author at Last

Throughout my childhood, writing was one of my favorite hobbies. I 23 spend hours dictating my stories to my parents and then, when I was older, writing them down myself. When I got to college, though, I approached my major pragmatically and decided to study engineering. Still, I 24 sheltered hopes of one day publishing a novel.

Although my job at a biotechnology company was tiring, I couldn't shake the need to write. Every night, after the rest of my family had gone to sleep, I would turn on my computer and go to work. It wasn't always easy to keep 25 writing sometimes, I sat for hours in front of a blank screen, racking my brain to figure out what should happen next. Eventually, though, my writer's block would dissolve, and seeing 26 them fill up gave me a feeling of great satisfaction. After nearly a year of working this way, I had completed a draft of my book. Now I just needed to publish it. I sent some inquiries to traditional publishing companies, 27 and I anxiously waited for an answer. My book showed promise, they said, but it would be difficult to market and sell because I did not already have an established reputation as an author. Although I was disappointed, I was also determined.
