## C. Verb Before Subject

In this structure, the normal word order (or syntax) of a sentence is reversed so that the verb is placed before the subject. Sentences testing this structure may begin with a prepositional phrase, followed by the verb and then subject.

In the examples below, the subject is underlined, the prepositional phrase is italicized, and the verb is bold.
Incorrect: Along the Loup Canal in Nebraska extends parks, lakes, and trails owned and operated by the Loup power district.

Correct: Along the Loup Canal in Nebraska extend parks, lakes, and trails owned and operated by the Loup power district.

Most often, the preposition will be the first word of the sentence, as in the example sentences above, but sometimes it will be the second.

Incorrect: $\quad$ Running along the Loup Canal in Nebraska is parks, lakes, and trails owned and operated by the Loup power district.

Correct: $\quad$ Running along the Loup Canal in Nebraska are parks, lakes, and trails owned and operated by the Loup power district.

# This structure can be confusing because the reversed syntax makes the sentence sound odd. It is important to understand, however, that the unusual syntax itself is not what makes the sentence incorrect. It is simply a distraction to keep you from hearing the disagreement between the subject and the verb.

Sometimes a sentence in this form will not contain an agreement error. In such cases, you will still need to be able to identify the subject and double-check the agreement in order to confirm that no change is necessary.

It is also important that you be able to determine the subject because you may also encounter errors in which the verb comes before the subject but is not preceded by a prepositional phrase:

Incorrect: Radioactivity is generally not considered harmful when people are exposed to it at low levels for brief periods, but less clear is its long-term effects.

Correct: Radioactivity is generally not considered harmful when people are exposed to it at low levels for brief periods, but less clear are its long-term effects.

When there is no preposition at the start of the sentence, there are unfortunately no real tip-offs for this error besides the presence of both singular and plural verb forms in the answer choices. The easiest way to identify the subject is simply to ask yourself what is "less clear" - the plural noun long-term effects is the only option that makes sense, so the sentence requires the plural verb are.
