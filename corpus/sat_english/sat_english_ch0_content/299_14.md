Which choice most effectively establishes the main topic of the paragraph?
A) NO CHANGE
B) Most city-dwellers live in apartments rather than free-standing houses.
C) Modular buildings - also known as prefabricated buildings - are buildings that consist of multiple sections called modules.
D) While apartments usually have less space than houses, they have benefits as well.

Modular buildings can function not only as temporary structures such as construction camps 15 and as long-term ones such as apartment buildings. In the past, they were primarily used in remote areas where more traditional construction was impossible. 16 Today, however, they are increasingly used in cities with rapidly expanding populations. Additional homes and apartments are urgently needed to house the new inhabitants, and modular construction can deliver quickly. In fact, it takes 17 slightly longer to install a traditional home than it takes to install a modular one.
