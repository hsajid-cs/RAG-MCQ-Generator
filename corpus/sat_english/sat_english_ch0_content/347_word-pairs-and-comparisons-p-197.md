## Word Pairs and Comparisons, p. 197

1.1 D: The original version incorrectly compares no expedition (thing) to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark (people). D) appropriately uses as to complete the word pair (no expedition was as influential in shaping the United States as the expedition led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark) and corrects the faulty comparison by comparing an expedition to an expedition.
1.2 D: Not only appears earlier in the sentence and so must be accompanied by but also.
2.1 B: Than, not then, must be used to create the comparative form of an adjective (larger). As must be paired with as, and from is simply incorrect.
2.2 A: The original version correctly pairs as with as (Just as many meteorites appear in the atmosphere during daylight as appear at night).
3.1 C: The original version incorrectly compares Child's reliance on recipes (thing) to almost any other cook of her caliber (person). B) creates the same error. D) can be eliminated as well because then cannot be used to form comparisons. That leaves C), which provides the correct form: than.
3.2 B: Neither appears earlier in the sentence and must be paired with nor.
3.3 D: Not only appears earlier in the sentence and must be paired with but also.
4.1 A: In the original version, as is correctly paired with as.
4.2 D: A) incorrectly compares features [of the house] to any other house. Features must be compared to features. B) creates the same error and incorrectly uses then rather than than. C) incorrectly pairs more with as and uses the singular pronoun that rather than the plural pronoun those to replace the plural noun features. D) correctly pairs more with than and uses the plural pronoun those. Those of any other house $=$ the features of any other house.

4.3 C: Not only appears earlier in the sentence and must be paired with but also.
5.1 B: Either appears earlier in the sentence and must be paired with or.
5.2 B: More must be paired with than.
5.3 D: As appears earlier in the sentence and must be paired with as, eliminating B) and C). A) is does not work because this option illogically compares each pallet (physical object) to the size of a refrigerator. D) correctly compares a pallet (physical object) to a refrigerator (physical object).
