A) NO CHANGE
B) had been
C) would be
D) is

Out of context, the sentence is fine. If you looked at it on its own, you would have no way of knowing whether there was a problem. B), C), and D) are all grammatically acceptable as well (although more complex tenses such as would be and had been are less likely to appear as correct answers). As a result, it is necessary to consider the verbs in the surrounding sentences: is, belongs, and grow. All of those verbs are in the present tense, so the underlined verb must be in the present tense as well. Only is fits, so D) is correct.

In addition, when a sentence includes two verbs in different tenses, each item must include a separate conjugated verb corresponding to the appropriate tense.

Incorrect: The forestry industry has met and continue to meet the growing changes required to stay competitive within a rapidly transforming economy.

Correct: The forestry industry has met and will continue to meet the growing changes required to stay competitive within a rapidly transforming economy.

Although many tense questions will require you to keep the tense of a particular verb consistent with the tense of the surrounding verbs, correct answers may sometimes depend on other factors.
