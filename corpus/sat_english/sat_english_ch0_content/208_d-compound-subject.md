## D. Compound Subject

A compound subject consists of two nouns - singular or plural - joined by the word and. Compound subjects are always plural and thus take plural verbs.

While compound subjects are generally quite straightforward in short, simple sentences, they can be easy to overlook in longer ones if you do not read carefully or only pay attention to the noun next to the verb. Errors involving compound subjects can also be very difficult to hear, so you cannot rely on your ear.

For example:
Incorrect: Pigeons make highly effective messengers because their speed and homing ability allows them to quickly and reliably reach familiar destinations.

Correct: Pigeons make highly effective messengers because their speed and homing ability allow them to quickly and reliably reach familiar destinations.

You should be especially careful to determine the complete subject when the verb appears before the subject, as in the second example below. Agreement errors involving this type of syntax are exceptionally hard to identify by ear, even if they would be fairly obvious without the inverted word order.

Incorrect: A park and a lake runs along the Loup Canal, a hydroelectric and irrigation canal located in eastern Nebraska.

Incorrect: Along the Loup Canal runs a park and a lake, both of which are owned and operated by the Loup Power District.

Both versions of the sentence contain the same error, but the second one hides it much more effectively.
