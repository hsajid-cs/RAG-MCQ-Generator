## Contraction with Verb

The construction $-s+$ apostrophe is also used to form a contraction between a noun and the verb is or has. This usage is not a major focus of the SAT, but you should have a basic understanding of it, just in case.

Correct: The newspaper's distributed nationally. = The newspaper is distributed nationally.
Correct: The manager's requested a report. = The manager has requested a report.
