8. Webs allow spiders to catch prey without having to expend energy chasing it around. However, 1 it's a tiring dilemma because of the large amount of protein required, in the form of silk. In addition, silk quickly loses its stickiness and becomes inefficient at capturing prey. As a result, spiders often eat 2 it's own webs daily to regain some of the energy used in spinning. The silk proteins are thus recycled.
9. There are over 3,000 lizard species, but the Komodo dragon, a reptile with ancestors that date back more than 100 million years, wins the prize for being the largest living lizard in the world. 1 They're name came from rumors of a large dragon-like lizard inhabiting the warm, hilly islands of Indonesia. Indeed, the yellow color of its long forked tongue reminds people of a mythical fire-spitting dragon. Despite its ancient roots, the Komodo dragon was unknown to 2 them until 1910, when it was observed in Komodo National Park.
10. There are around 300 octopus species, all of which can change colors, squirt poison, and exert a force greater than that of their own body weight. In fact, 1 they're part of an elite group of marine creatures with remarkably large brains. Scientists have found that octopuses can not only navigate their way through mazes, but they can also solve problems quickly and remember 2 that.
