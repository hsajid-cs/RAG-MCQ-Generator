A) NO CHANGE
B) ago); contains
C) ago contains
D) ago) contains

In order to answer this question, it is necessary to back up to the beginning of the sentence and notice the parenthesis after London. A parenthesis must be paired with another parenthesis, so A) and C) can be automatically eliminated. B) can also be eliminated because a semicolon can only separate two sentences, and contains a number of extremely modern neighborhoods is not a sentence. That leaves D), which is correct.

Another potential error involves placing both commas and parentheses around a non-essential clause. As a general rule, either commas or parentheses should be used. Because these two types of punctuation signal non-essential information, it is redundant to use both. (The one exception is discussed below.)

For example:

The tower of 1 London, (a structure begun by William the Conqueror in 1078), is one of the largest and most imposing fortifications in England.
