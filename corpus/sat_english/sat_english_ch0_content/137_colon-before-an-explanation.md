## Colon Before an Explanation

When a colon comes before an explanation, a complete sentence typically follows. As a result, a colon, a semicolon, a period, and a dash (see next page) are all acceptable in some cases.

Correct: The Amazon parrot does not make an ideal pet for most people: it requires much more attention and affection than many other animals do.

Correct: The Amazon parrot does not make an ideal pet for most people. It (or: people; it) requires much more attention and affection than many other animals do.

Because all of these types of punctuation are often interchangeable, you will not usually be asked to decide among them; however, there are exceptions. In such cases, a colon is only correct if the second clause explains the first. Otherwise, a different form of punctuation should be used.

Incorrect: Hersheypark was created in 1907 as a leisure park for the employees of the Hershey Chocolate Company: the decision was later made to open it to the general public.

Correct: Hersheypark was created in 1907 as a leisure park for the employees of the Hershey Chocolate Company; the decision (or: Company. The decision) was later made to open it to the general public.

Because dashes are used more frequently in British English than in American English, they tend to be the least familiar type of punctuation for many test-takers. That said, they are fairly straightforward.

Dashes have three major uses:

1) Set off a non-essential clause
2) Introduce a list or explanation
3) Create a deliberate pause

The vast majority of SAT questions that test dashes involve the first use. Questions testing the second use appear occasionally, and questions testing the third appear only rarely.

# Non-Essential Clause: 2 Dashes $=2$ Commas

As discussed earlier, two dashes are exactly equivalent to two commas. If one dash appears, so must the other. Another punctuation mark such as a comma cannot be used in place of it.
