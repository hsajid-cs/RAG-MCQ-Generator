A) NO CHANGE
B) The envelope marked "Alaska Commercial Company,"
C) The envelope, marked "Alaska Commercial Company,"
D) The envelope, marked "Alaska Commercial Company"

Solution: The key to answering this question is to recognize that the sentence is referring to one specific envelope. (The previous sentence clearly states that Gofoth found a big shopping bag with an envelope inside.)

The next sentence can therefore only be referring to that single envelope - it cannot be implying that the envelope Goforth found was one of many envelopes. Because the clause marked "Alaska Commercial Company" describes that one particular envelope, commas must be used. C) is therefore correct.

On the other hand, consider this version of the passage:

In 2004, while rummaging in a Seattle basement, historian and journalist J. Pennelope Goforth came across a silver shopping bag filled with envelopes. I The envelope marked "Alaska Commercial Company" immediately caught her attention. Goforth had a longstanding interest in the company, which had controlled Alaska's waters in the nineteenth century.
