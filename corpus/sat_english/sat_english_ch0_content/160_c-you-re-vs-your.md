The same rule applies to those pronouns as applies to the ones discussed throughout this chapter: apostrophe $+-s$ or $-r e=$ contraction with verb, while no apostrophe $=$ possessive.

|  | Pronoun + verb | Possessive |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| That | That's | Thats $=$ does not exist |
| He, She | He's, She's | His, Her(s) |
| We | We're | Our, Ours |
