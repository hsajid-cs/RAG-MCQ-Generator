A) NO CHANGE
B) London, (a structure begun by William the Conqueror in 1078)
C) London (a structure begun by William the Conqueror in 1078),
D) London (a structure begun by William the Conqueror in 1078)

All of the incorrect answer choices above violate the "one punctuation type" rule. A) places both a comma and a parenthesis at the beginning as well as the end of the non-essential clause; B) places both types of punctuation at the beginning of the non-essential clause; and C) places them at the end.

The only grammatically acceptable answer is D), which does not include any unnecessary punctuation before or after the parentheses.

Now we're going to make things a little harder. As discussed above, it is incorrect to use both a closeparenthesis and a comma for the sole purpose of marking the end of a non-essential clause.

When a comma is grammatically necessary for other reasons, however, it is acceptable to place one after a close-parenthesis.

For example, take a look at the following question:

The tower of London was constructed as a prison in the eleventh century (the year 11078 to be exact); but over the centuries it has been used as everything from a treasury to an armory.
