## I

A) NO CHANGE
B) water; likewise, more animals are able to thrive there.
C) water, yet more animals are able to thrive there.
D) water, more animals are able to thrive there.

If you focus on the underlined portion of the sentence and neglect to back all the way up to the very beginning, you're likely to overlook the fact that a transition (because) is already present, and that it is therefore unnecessary to include another one.

Notice that it is not enough to look at just the previous line here. If you do not go two full lines up, you will not see the word because and will have no way of determining that the transition in the underlined portion is grammatically unacceptable.

If you do back up all the way and notice the transition, however, then there is only one possible answer: D).

On the other hand, you should not automatically assume that a no transition/DELETE option is correct.
For example:

Conditions in the interior of Antarctica are inhospitable to many forms of life: sub-zero temperatures, high winds, and extreme dryness make it impossible for most animals to survive. I Although the Antarctic Peninsula and the surrounding islands have milder temperatures and liquid water, more species are able to thrive there.
