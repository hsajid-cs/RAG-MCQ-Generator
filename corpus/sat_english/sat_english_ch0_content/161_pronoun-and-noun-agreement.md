## Pronoun and Noun Agreement

Many questions that test apostrophes also test pronoun agreement simultaneously. As a result, it is impossible to discuss one without discussing the other.

A pronoun must agree with the noun to which it refers, i.e., its antecedent or referent. Singular pronouns (e.g., she, it) must agree with singular nouns, and plural pronouns (e.g., they) must agree with plural nouns.

For example:

The cacao bean is the dried and fully fermented fatty bean of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao). I Their the source of cocoa butter and solids, including chocolate, as well as an ingredient in many Mesoamerican dishes such as molé and tejate.
