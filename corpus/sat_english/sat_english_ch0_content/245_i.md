## I

A) NO CHANGE
B) audiences being amazed.
C) audiences would be amazed.
D) audiences are amazed.

# Many people think that the original version is incorrect because the verb were should be repeated before the second adjective (amazed). In reality, the repetition is optional. It is correct to say both, Critics were dazzled and audiences were amazed, AND, Critics were dazzled and audiences amazed. A) is thus correct. All of the other options seriously disrupt the parallel structure and create unnecessary tense switches.

While you will not be asked to choose between the two constructions, you may be given only the first option (no repeated verb) as an answer choice. You must therefore be able to recognize that it is acceptable.
