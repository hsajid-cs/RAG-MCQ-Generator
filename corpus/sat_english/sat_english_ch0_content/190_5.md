9. Machines are often blamed for stealing people's jobs. 1 Moreover, some machines actually create work. Technology can boost productivity, increasing the demand for labor. It can also streamline complex tasks, opening the door for less skilled workers. The American inventor Eli Whitney invented machines that did both.

Whitney's most famous invention, the cotton gin, was patented in 1794. The 2 word, "gin," is short for "engine," and the cotton gin revolutionized cotton production by automating its processing. The device consisted of a set of wheels containing metal hooks. As the wheels turned, the hooks caught bits of cotton, pulling them through a screen that kept out seeds.
3 A wire brush periodically swept the cotton off the blade. This brush prevented the machine from jamming.

Inland cotton 4 farmers, who could only cultivate "green seed" cotton - found the gin especially useful. This type of cotton was so labor-intensive that it required 10 hours of hand labor to produce a single unit of
5 cotton: one Whitney cotton gin could do a full day's work of several men in an hour.
