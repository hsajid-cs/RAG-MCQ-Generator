## I

A) NO CHANGE
B) and also with
C) but also for
D) but also to

If you read from the beginning of the sentence, you'll see the first half of a word pair: not only. Not only must be paired with but also, so A) and B) can be eliminated. Because the preposition for is used after not only, it must be used after but also as well. C) is thus correct.

Although it's a bit more complicated, you can also think of the solution this way: the verb praised must be followed by for. That verb "applies" to two things: 1) the brilliance of her technique, and 2) the vividness and intensity of her movements. As a result, the preposition for must be used for both.

In some instance, the preposition before the second noun can also be omitted. That means you could see something like this:

As one of the greatest American dancers and choreographers of the twentieth century, Martha Graham was praised not only for the brilliance of her technique but also 1 in the vividness and intensity of her movements.
