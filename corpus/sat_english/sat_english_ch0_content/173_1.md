1. At the age of six Judith Jamison towered over her classmates. 1 Jamisons parents, who wanted to complement their daughter's exceptional height with 2 grace, and they enrolled her in a classical ballet class at the Judimar School of Dance, where she studied throughout her childhood. Jamison decided on a career in dance only after three semesters of coursework in psychology at Fisk University, and she completed her education at the Philadelphia Dance 3 Academy in 1964, she was spotted by choreographer Agnes de Mille, who invited her to appear in a performance with the American Ballet Theater. Jamison moved to New York the following 4 year, eventually joining the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
2. When a person breaks a bone, it eventually knits itself back together. I Microbiologist, Henk Jonkers, a researcher at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, wondered why buildings couldn't do the same. Inspired by the human body, Jonkers created selfhealing concrete. Concrete is filled with capsules of limestone-producing bacteria along with calcium lactate. When the concrete cracks, air and moisture prompt the bacteria to consume the calcium 2 lactate, they convert it to calcite, an ingredient in limestone. The cracks are sealed, and the concrete is stabilized.

This innovation could solve a longstanding problem with 3 concrete; the worlds most common construction material. Concrete often develops micro-cracks during the construction process. These tiny cracks don't immediately affect a building's structural integrity, but they can lead to leakage problems that can corrode the
4 concrete's steel reinforcements, ultimately causing a collapse. With the self-healing technology, cracks can be sealed immediately, preventing future leaks and costly long-term damage. The bacteria can lie dormant for up to two 5 centuries. Far longer than the lifespan of most buildings constructed today.
3. Perhaps the ocean organism most vulnerable to temperature change is coral. There is evidence that reefs will bleach - that is, eject algae that play a key role in maintaining their 1 ecosystems, at even a slight persistent increase in temperature. Bleaching slows coral growth, makes it susceptible to disease, and can lead to large-scale reef destruction. Other organisms affected by temperature change include 2 krill, it is a very important link at the base of the food chain. Research has shown that krill reproduce in significantly smaller numbers when ocean temperatures rise. The resulting decrease in the krill population can have a cascading effect by disrupting the life cycle of krill 3 eaters such as: penguins and seals, which in turn causes food shortages for predators higher up on the food chain.
