## I

A) NO CHANGE
B) On the other hand,
C) Accordingly,
D) DELETE the underlined portion (beginning the sentence with a capital letter).

Because D) contains no transition, it is especially important that we cross out therefore in the original version and examine the two statements without any transition.

1) Conditions in the interior of Antarctica are inhospitable to many forms of life.
2) Subzero temperatures, high winds, and extreme dryness make survival impossible for most animals.

The two sentences discuss similar ideas, but the second sentence just expands on the first sentence. It is not actually a result of the first sentence, so A) and C) can be eliminated. B) can be crossed out as well because on the other hand is a contradictor. The best option here is no transition at all, so the answer is in fact D).

In some cases, this option might be presented very subtly:

Conditions in the interior of Antarctica are inhospitable to many forms of I life, whereas sub-zero temperatures, high winds, and extreme dryness make it impossible for most animals to survive.
