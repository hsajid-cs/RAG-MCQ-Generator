## Dangling and Misplaced Modifiers

As a rule, modifiers should be placed as close as possible to the nouns, pronouns, or phrases they modify. When modifiers are separated from the words or phrases they modify, the result is often unclear and sometimes completely absurd. Although modification errors are of course presented in the context of passages, they involve only the sentences in which they appear; it is not necessary to consider the surrounding information.

There are two major types of modification errors:

1) Dangling Modifiers
2) Misplaced Modifiers
