## Who vs. Whom

There are two primary things to know about who and whom for the SAT:

1) Who is used before a verb.
2) Whom is used after a preposition.

A verb should never come right after whom. If it does, who should be used instead.
Incorrect: One of the first screen writers to include details such as stage directions in her work was June Mathis, whom helped make film into an art form.

Correct: One of the first screen writers to include details such as stage directions in her work was June Mathis, who helped make film into an art form.

Whom should, however, be used after a preposition (e.g., of, from, for, to, by, with, in, on, about).
Incorrect: Among Emily Dickinson's favorite writing partners was her sister-in-law, Susan Huntington, with who she exchanged hundreds of letters.

Correct: Among Emily Dickinson's favorite writing partners was her sister-in-law, Susan Huntington, with whom she exchanged hundreds of letters.

Important: When the construction pronoun + of whom is used, a verb can be placed after whom (e.g., some of whom believe, many of whom go). The use of whom is determined by the preposition of, not by the verb.

[^0]
[^0]:    *Some sources also permit the use of that for people, but this usage is controversial and is not tested on the SAT.

# Where, When, and "Preposition + Which"

Where refers to places (physical locations) only. It should not be used to refer to times or books/films, even though these uses are common in everyday speech.

When refers to times and events only.
Preposition + which (e.g., in which, during which, to which) can be used in place of where or when. Although this construction may sound odd to you, it is perfectly acceptable.

Incorrect: The Middle Ages was a period where many farmers were bound to the land they worked.

Correct: The Middle Ages was a period when/in which many farmers were bound to the land they worked.

Incorrect: Life of Pi, written by Yann Martel, is a novel where the protagonist survives on a raft in the ocean for nearly a year, accompanied by only a tiger.

Correct: Life of Pi, written by Yann Martel, is a novel in which the protagonist survives on a raft in the ocean for nearly a year, accompanied by only a tiger.

Watch out for answers that do not place a preposition before which.
Incorrect: New York is a city which many people travel by subway rather than by car.
Correct: New York is a city in which many people travel by subway rather than by car.
Correct: New York is a city where many people travel by subway rather than by car.
As a general rule, if where/when and preposition + which are both acceptable and appear in different answers, there will be a separate factor that makes one choice correct and the other(s) incorrect.
