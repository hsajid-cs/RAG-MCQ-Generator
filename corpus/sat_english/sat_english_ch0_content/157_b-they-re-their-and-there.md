## B. They're, Their, and There

Although the same apostrophe rules apply to they're vs. their as apply to other pronouns, an extra degree of confusion is often present because of a third identical-sounding pronoun: there.

They're $=$ they are
Their $=$ possessive of they. Used before a noun.
There $=$ a place
In general, it is easiest to think of there as separate from they're and their, which both involve they.
To check their vs. they're, plug in they are. If you can plug in this phrase, the apostrophe is necessary. If you can't plug it in, no apostrophe should be used.

To check there, simply ask yourself whether the pronoun is referring to a place. The passage will make it clear whether this is the case.

# They're

Incorrect: Although their usually powered by rowers, canoes may also have sails or motors.
Incorrect: Although there usually powered by rowers, canoes may also have sails or motors.
Correct: Although they're usually powered by rowers, canoes may also contain sails or motors.

Because you would say, Although they are usually powered by rowers, the apostrophe is required.
