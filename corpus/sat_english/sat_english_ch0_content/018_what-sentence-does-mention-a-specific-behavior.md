## What sentence does mention a specific behavior?

Sentence 4 mentions that bees [flap] their wings to dry out the nectar. That fits as a behavior, so logically, sentence 3 belongs after it.

In addition, sentence 5 refers to an enzyme called glucose oxidase, which is consistent with the idea of chemical makeup in sentence 3. That confirms the placement of sentence 3 between sentences 4 and 5. C) is thus correct.
