## A. To Separate Items in a List

In any list of three or more items, each item must be followed by a comma. The comma before and is optional. You will not be asked to choose between a version with the comma and a version without the comma.

Correct: The museum's new open-storage display brings over 900 vintage World's Fair souvenirs out of attics, desk drawers, shoeboxes, and museum archives for visitors to view.

Correct: The museum's new open-storage display brings over 900 vintage World's Fair souvenirs out of attics, desk drawers, shoeboxes and museum archives for visitors to view.

No comma should ever be used after the word and,
Incorrect: The museum's open-storage display brings over 900 vintage World's Fair souvenirs out of attics, desk drawers, shoeboxes, and, museum archives for visitors to view.

Incorrect: The museum's open-storage display brings over 900 vintage World's Fair souvenirs out of attics, desk drawers, shoeboxes and, museum archives for visitors to view.

When the items in a list consist of long phrases, or are punctuated internally by commas, they can also be separated with semicolons. The only rule is that commas and semicolons should not be mixed and matched, but should remain consistent throughout. Note that this construction has not appeared as a correct answer on a released test to date; however, I am addressing it here for the sake of thoroughness.

Incorrect: Among Marie Curie's achievements were the development of the theory of radioactivity; the invention of techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of the elements polonium and radium.

# B. Between Two Adjectives Whose Order Could be Reversed, OR That Could Be Separated by the Word "And"

When the order of the adjectives does not matter, a comma should be used to separate them.
Correct: $\quad$ One of the Queens Museum's recent exhibits featured works by contemporary artists from Japan, Taiwan, and Ireland, offering patrons the chance to see a kind of innovative, passionate art that larger museums often ignore.

Correct: $\quad$ One of the Queens Museum's recent exhibits featured works by contemporary artists from Japan, Taiwan, and Ireland, offering patrons the chance to see a kind of passionate, innovative art that larger museums often ignore.

Alternately, you can try placing the word and between the adjectives. If they make sense when separated by that word, a comma should be used.

Correct: $\quad$ One of the Queens Museum's recent exhibits featured works by contemporary artists from Japan, Taiwan, and Ireland, offering patrons the chance to see a kind of innovative and passionate art that larger museums often ignore.
