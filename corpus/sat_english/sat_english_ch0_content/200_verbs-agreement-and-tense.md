## Verbs: Agreement and Tense

The SAT contains two types of verb questions:

1) Subject-verb agreement
2) Verb tense

Although some questions may test both concepts, it is important to understand that they are distinct.

- Agreement answers the question "singular or plural?" Verbs must agree with their subjects; singular subjects must take singular verbs, and plural subjects must take plural verbs.
- Tense answers the question "when?" It indicates past, present, or future.

Let's consider the following sentence:
The feathers of the black-backed woodpecker has evolved to blend in with charred trees so that they are invisible to predators lurking in the forest.

This sentence contains a disagreement between the subject and the verb because the subject (feathers) is plural and the verb (has) is singular. The singular noun woodpecker, which appears immediately before the verb, is part of the prepositional phrase of the black-backed woodpecker and has no effect on the number of the verb. In order to correct the sentence, we must use the plural verb have rather than the singular verb has.

When many students encounter this type of sentence, however, their first instinct is to change the tense of the verb and use the past tense, had. While this change does make the sentence grammatically acceptable, there is no compelling reason for the sentence to be rewritten in another tense. More importantly, the correction does not address the actual problem: the subject and the verb disagree.

But, you might wonder, why does that matter if had fixes the sentence anyway? Why bother learning all that grammar if you can get the question right without worrying about any of it?

Well, because you could see a question that looks like this:

The works of artist Alan Chin has included elements inspired by both the California gold rush and the transcontinental railroad.
