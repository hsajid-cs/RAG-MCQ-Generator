## Pronoun (of them) $=$ sentence

In this usage, the pronoun simply acts as a subject and is used to replace a noun. It is often followed by the phrase of them, but it can be used by itself as well.

Sentence: Many (of them) are grown in greenhouses around the world.
Sentence: Most (of them) believe that the tomato is a vegetable.
Taken out of any context, the above examples don't make much sense, nor do they provide any real information. Regardless of how odd you find these examples, however, they are still sentences because each one contains a subject (many, most) and a verb (are, believe) that corresponds to it.
