There are a few other foods, such as uncooked rice, that keep indefinitely. Honey, though, is unique: no one would consume raw rice or plain salt, but a thousand-year-old jar of honey could be eaten without preparation.

A jar of honey's seal, it turns out, is another factor creating a long shelf life. [C] Though honey is clearly a superfood, it's still subject to the laws of nature - if left unsealed in a damp environment, it will go bad.

As a result of this quality, along with a thickness that prevents wounds from becoming infected, honey has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. The earliest recorded use comes from Sumerian clay tablets, which indicate that honey was used in numerous remedies.
