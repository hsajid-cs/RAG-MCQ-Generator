## Adding, Deleting, and Revising

In keeping with the redesigned SAT's focus on supporting evidence, questions that ask you to add, delete, or revise information make up the largest component of the Writing and Language Test. You can expect around 12 of these questions per exam, or three per passage. Add/Delete/Revise questions can be phrased in a variety of ways, but they all test essentially the same thing: whether information is relevant or irrelevant to the main topic of a paragraph or passage.

Most questions will therefore require that you consider the context of the surrounding sentences and/or paragraphs. The process for answering them can be divided into the following three steps:

1) Reread the paragraph.
2) Briefly restate the topic in your own words.
3) Check each answer choice against that topic.

When a question asks you to take the entire passage into account, you do not need to spend time rereading the entire passage. Instead, focus on a couple of key places: 1) the beginning of the passage, where the main idea or theme is most likely to be presented; and 2) the surrounding sentences (particularly the preceding sentence), among which the sentence in question must fit logically.

It is important that you go through these steps on your own before you look at the answers. Otherwise, you are more likely to be distracted by plausible-sounding choices that don't actually answer the question.

To be clear, you do not need to provide detailed answers. Just take a few moments to get a general idea of the paragraph's focus and determine what sort of information the correct answer should contain. If you keep those things in mind, you'll generally get to the answer pretty quickly. If you don't, however, then relatively straightforward questions can become unnecessarily confusing and time consuming.

Some Add/Delete/Revise questions will ask you to identify the information that best begins or concludes a given paragraph. Although these questions ask about different parts of the paragraph, they are both testing whether you understand the topic and main idea of the paragraph or passage, and they should be approached the same way.

The general purpose of both the topic sentence and the concluding sentence is to present or reinforce the main idea of the paragraph/passage. The fact that one is at the beginning while the other is at the end is incidental; the information in the middle is what you actually need to focus on.

Remember also that topic sentences and concluding sentences tend to contain main ideas. As a result, answers that include specific details are less likely to be correct.

Let's start by looking at a "topic sentence" question, using the fifth paragraph from our passage on p. 15.

1 The earliest recorded use comes from
Sumerian clay tablets, which indicate that honey was used in more than a quarter of all prescriptions. The ancient Greeks and Egyptians also used honey regularly in ointments for skin and eye diseases. Locally produced honey can be an effective treatment for seasonal allergies. The medical device company Derma Sciences sells MediHoney, bandages covered in honey, to hospitals in over 25 countries. In fact, honey has been shown to prevent the growth of foodborne pathogens such as E. coli.

Which of the following provides the best introduction to the paragraph?
A) The carbohydrates in honey can easily be converted to energy because the body quickly digests this natural substance.
B) As a result of this quality, along with a thickness that prevents wounds from becoming infected, honey has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries.
C) In contrast to other sweeteners such as sugar, honey contains a number of vitamins and minerals.
D) Some studies have found that honey can also raise blood sugar levels, but more slowly and by smaller amounts than other sweeteners do.

Although this question asks about the introduction - i.e., the topic sentence - you cannot answer it until you know what the rest of the paragraph is about. That means you need to read the rest of the paragraph, or at least the next few sentences. (If there is a NO CHANGE option, you can even cross out the first sentence - lightly and in pencil - if you think it will distract you.)

If we had to sum up the paragraph above, we might say something like "medical uses of honey," or "honey $=$ medicine." B) is the only answer that mentions that idea, and it's almost exactly what our summary says. So it's correct.

Now we're going to look at a "conclusion" question:

The earliest recorded use comes from Sumerian clay tablets, which indicate that honey was used in more than a quarter of all prescriptions. The ancient Greeks and Egyptians also used honey regularly in ointments for skin and eye diseases. Locally produced honey can be an effective treatment for seasonal allergies. The medical device company Derma Sciences sells MediHoney, bandages covered in honey, to hospitals in over 25 countries. 1 In fact, honey has been shown to prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens such as E. coli.

The writer wants a concluding sentence that restates the main idea of the passage. Which choice best accomplishes this goal?
A) NO CHANGE
B) People with insulin sensitivity should use caution when consuming honey because it causes blood sugar to rise.
C) Whether its applications are confirmed by science or passed down through tradition, honey is as useful as it is delicious.
D) However, honey should not be given to infants younger than 12 months old because it can contain dangerous botulism spores.

When a lot of people encounter a question like this, they aren't quite sure what to do. Because they've been focusing on the details as they read, they don't have a particularly strong sense of the passage as a whole, and they don't really want to go back and read the whole thing. At that point, they usually guess. Needless to say (I hope!), that's usually not a very good idea.

The bad news is that if you're not totally sure what the passage was about, you have to go back and do some rereading. The good news, though, is that you won't usually have to reread very much - usually only a few key sentences.

To reiterate: Big-picture information will virtually always be presented at the beginning of the passage. Because passages are so short, main ideas tend to come first by necessity; there isn't room to take time getting to the point. Rereading the title can also help focus you. After all, its purpose is to tell you what the passage is going to be about.

For "conclusion" questions, you can also focus on the last paragraph, particularly the second-to-last sentence. Even though these questions ask about the big picture, the concluding sentence must still follow logically from the sentence before it. Any answer that is unrelated to the information in that sentence must be incorrect.

In this particular case, the title Honey: A Natural Superfood gives you a pretty good idea of what the passage is about. It also tells you that the passage will be extremely positive towards honey. As a result, you can assume that the answer to any question asking about the passage as a whole will be positive as well. And if you skim through the first paragraph, you get even more information: Moreover, honey's longevity gives it medicinal properties not found in other long-lasting foods. The last paragraph reiterates that idea.

Based on that information, you can eliminate B) immediately. The main idea is very positive, so the conclusion should be positive as well. The word caution indicates that B) is negative. It does not matter whether you know anything about insulin sensitivity - don't get caught up in the details.
D) is slightly negative as well. It's also completely off-topic.

Be careful with A). The fact that honey can prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens might initially seem consistent with the paragraph's focus on honey's medical uses, as well as with the preceding statement that certain types of honey contain anti-inflammatory properties.

The problem, however, is that the question asks you to identify the answer that restates a main idea of the passage. As a rule, concluding sentences that reflect main themes are pretty general, but A) provides a specific example (E. coli). If you skim through the rest of the passage, you'll also see that E. coli isn't mentioned anywhere else - and by definition, an idea that only shows up in one part of the passage can't be a main idea.

So that leaves C), which is positive, a broad statement, and consistent with the main idea.

Other "main idea" questions will be presented in a less direct manner. In fact, they may involve sentences that appear in the middle of a paragraph. In such cases, you will be asked to identify the answer that "sets up" or "transitions to" the information/examples that follow. Although these questions may not include the phrase main idea, the correct answer must be consistent with the primary idea or claim conveyed by the information that comes after.

For example:

The carbohydrates in honey can easily be converted to energy because the body easily digests this natural substance. The earliest recorded use comes from Sumerian clay tablets, which indicate that honey was used in numerous remedies. The ancient Greeks and Egyptians also used medicinal honey regularly in ointments for skin and eye diseases. I Raw, locally produced honey can be an effective treatment for seasonal allergies. The medical device company Derma Sciences sells MediHoney, bandages covered in honey, to hospitals in over 25 countries.

Which choice provides the best transition to the information that follows?
OR:
Which choice most effectively sets up the example that follows?
A) NO CHANGE
B) When honey is over-processed, however, it loses its curative properties.
C) Today, honey-based treatments are used around the world.
D) Manuka honey has anti-bacterial properties and can even be used as a mouthwash.

Don't be fooled if a question asks about a "transition," which implies a relationship to the information that comes both before and after. Unless you are specifically directed to look at the preceding information, these questions are really asking which choice is most relevant to the information that follows. It doesn't matter whether an option makes sense on its own, or even in context of what comes before. What counts is what comes after.

What comes after here? An example of a company that distributes a honey-based treatment to hospitals in over 25 countries. So we're looking for something that's going to introduce that fact. Presumably, it will emphasize the fact that honey is used as a treatment internationally.

The original version doesn't make sense. There's no relationship between the fact that honey can treat seasonal allergies and a medical device company that distributes products all over the world.
B) and D) also don't fit: neither the fact that honey can lose its power when it is over-processed nor that a particular form of honey can be used as mouthwash has anything to do with one (modern) company's distribution of honey-covered bandages.

The only answer that makes sense is C): the phrase over 25 countries corresponds precisely to around the world. And logically, that type of distribution would only be possible in modern times.

"Topic sentence" and "conclusion" questions test your ability to determine main points from supporting ideas and pieces of evidence. "Supporting evidence" questions do the opposite - that is, they test your ability to determine what type of information or examples support a main idea.

Let's look at how some "support" questions might be phrased:

One reason that honey does not spoil involves the chemical makeup of the substance itself. Honey is extremely acidic, with a pH that falls between 3 and 4.5 , depending on its floral source. As a result, invading microorganisms are unable to grow. In addition,

1 honey contains very little water in its natural state, preventing bacteria from flourishing.

Which choice gives a second supporting example that is most similar to the example already in the sentence?

OR:
Which choice provides the most relevant detail?
A) NO CHANGE
B) molasses is a byproduct of cane sugar and has an exceptionally long shelf life.
C) honey may cause bacterial infections in people with weakened immune systems.
D) fructose and glucose are responsible for honey's sweet taste.

The first version of the question gives us more information, but it does not tell us everything. While it directs us to the first example, it does not tell us to read the topic sentence - which is where the purpose of the paragraph is made clear. It is certainly possible to answer the question without that information, but it is much easier to answer the question with it.

The second version is phrased more vaguely, but it requires us to do exactly the same thing: back up and determine the point. We can't determine whether information is relevant without it.

What is the point? That the chemical makeup of honey prevents it from spoiling. So the correct answer must provide an example of how honey's composition allows the substance to stay fresh.
B) is off-topic. The first sentence makes clear that the paragraph is about honey, not molasses. B) is out.
C) is off-topic as well, but less directly. Although this answer, like A), refers to bacteria, the context is completely different: the correct answer must focus on the characteristics of honey itself, whereas C) focuses on honey's effect on people. This answer can be eliminated as well.
D) might be tempting as well because of the reference to fructose and glucose. Although those words might seem consistent with the idea of a chemical makeup, the correct answer must explain why honey does not spoil. Sweetness has nothing to do with that fact.

That leaves us with A), which is the answer. Logically, bacteria would cause honey to spoil. The absence of water would prevent bacteria from flourishing, thus keeping honey fresh.

Questions that test your understanding of main ideas can also be tested the other way around, namely in terms of counterarguments, or counterpoints - arguments that contradict (main) ideas or points. This concept tends to appear in answer choices, but it can be directly tested in questions as well.

Let's start with the first type:

The earliest recorded use comes from Sumerian clay tablets, which indicate that honey was used in numerous remedies. The ancient Greeks and Egyptians also used medicinal honey regularly in ointments for skin and eye diseases. Today, honey-based treatments are used around the world. The medical device company Derma Sciences sells MediHoney, bandages covered in honey, to hospitals in over 25 countries. 1 The benefits of this treatment aren't just folklore: studies show that certain types of honey have anti-inflammatory properties.

The question could also be asked this way:

The earliest recorded use comes from Sumerian clay tablets, which indicate that honey was used in numerous remedies. The ancient Greeks and Egyptians also used medicinal honey regularly in ointments for skin and eye diseases. Today, honey-based treatments are used around the world. The medical device company Derma Sciences sells MediHoney, bandages covered in honey, to hospitals in over 25 countries. 2

The writer is considering deleting the underlined sentence. Should it be deleted?
A) Yes, because it does not indicate which types of honey are most effective at reducing inflammation.
B) Yes, because it does not explain how the Greeks and Egyptians knew that honey was an effective remedy.
C) No, because it provides an explanation of how honey reduces inflammation.
D) No, because it effectively anticipates and refutes a potential counterargument.

Which choice most effectively anticipates and addresses a counterargument to the examples in the paragraph?
A) Because of the difficulties in controlling bees, a small proportion of any type of honey will come from a different nectar.
B) The benefits of this treatment aren't just folklore: studies show that certain types of honey have anti-inflammatory properties.
C) Despite varying regulations, the medical device market is projected to experience considerable growth in coming years.
D) Topical honey can be used to treat both simple and complex injuries.

Although these questions are phrased differently, they both test your understanding of counterarguments. What is the focus of the paragraph? The fact that honey has been used as medicine for thousands of years. What would be a reasonable objection to the example presented? Something along the lines of, "But honey is such a common food! Can it really do all of these amazing things?" The final sentence addresses (i.e., acknowledges and responds to) that possible reaction by suggesting that there is in fact scientific support for honey's healing powers. D) is thus the answer to the first example, and B) is the answer to the second.

Now let's look at another type of DELETE example:

While excavating ancient Egyptian tombs, modern archaeologists have often found something unexpected among the artifacts: pots of honey. Although these pots are thousands of years old, the honey remains as sweet and edible as it was during the time of the Pharaohs. There are a few other foods, such as uncooked rice, that keep indefinitely. Honey, though, is unique: no one would consume raw rice or plain salt, but a thousand-year-old jar of honey could be eaten without preparation.

1 Honey can also be used in a variety of salad dressings, glazes, and spreads. Moreover, honey's longevity provides medicinal properties not found in other long-lasting foods.

The writer is considering deleting the underlined sentence. Should it be kept or deleted?
A) Kept, because it provides background information about traditional uses of honey.
B) Kept, because it indicates that honey is an exceptionally versatile food.
C) Deleted, because it contradicts the idea that honey can be consumed without preparation.
D) Deleted, because it blurs the paragraph's focus on honey's ability to remain unspoiled over time.

Although the question only asks directly about one sentence, it's really asking us to look at the entire paragraph. The sentence itself is only important insofar as it is relevant - or not - to the surrounding information.

Because we have two KEPT and two DELETED options, we're going to tackle the question in two steps.

1) Determine whether the sentence should be kept.
2) Determine why the sentence should or should not be kept.

The first thing we're going to do is forget the underlined sentence (preferably crossing it out lightly and in pencil) and look only at the rest of the paragraph.

If we had to sum up the main topic of the paragraph in a few words, we might say something like "honey stays good forever," or "honey never goes bad."

What's the focus of the sentence to be added? That honey can be used in all different types of foods.
Although the sentence is still about honey, it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that honey can stay fresh for thousands of years. So it should not be added. The fact that it sounds sort of okay in context is irrelevant.

Now for the "why:" simply put, the sentence is off-topic. It in no way contradicts the fact that honey can be consumed plain, so C) does not fit. Don't get thrown off by the phrase blur the focus in D). The College Board is partial to this phrase, presumably because so many test-takers are likely to find it confusing. It simply means "departs from the main focus," i.e., is off-topic. D) is thus correct.

The question could also be tested from an ADD perspective:

While excavating ancient Egyptian tombs, modern archaeologists have often found something unexpected among the artifacts: pots of honey. Although these pots are thousands of years old, the honey remains as sweet and edible as it was during the time of the Pharaohs. There are a few other foods, such as uncooked rice, that keep indefinitely. Honey, though, is unique: no one would consume raw rice or plain salt, but a thousand-year-old jar of honey could be eaten without preparation.
1 Moreover, honey's longevity provides medicinal properties not found in other long-lasting foods.

At this point, the writer is considering adding the following sentence.

Honey can also be used in a variety of salad dressings, glazes, and spreads.
Should the writer make this addition here?
A) Kept, because it provides background information about traditional uses of honey.
B) Kept, because it indicates that honey is an exceptionally versatile food.
C) Deleted, because it contradicts the idea that honey can be consumed without preparation.
D) Deleted, because it blurs the paragraph's focus on honey's ability to remain unspoiled over time.

Even though the question is phrased differently, the same logic still applies: the sentence in question is offtopic and should not be added, again making D) the correct answer.

# Specific Emphasis or Example

Some questions may also ask you to insert or change information to make it consistent with a particular emphasis or example. These questions can be tricky because the version in the passage may sound correct and initially seem to make sense in context. If you don't pay close attention to the wording of the question, you can easily assume that things are fine when they're actually not. To avoid this trap, you should focus on the answer choices and their fit with the emphasis indicated in the question, not on the contextual information in the passage.

The process for answering these questions can be broken into two steps:

1) Underline the key word(s) or phrase - the information indicating what the writer wants to convey.
2) Check each answer against the key information, and see whether it matches.

Let's look at an example:

A jar of honey's seal, it turns out, is the final factor in creating a long shelf life. Though honey is clearly a superfood, I it can have adverse effects if consumed in excess - when left unsealed in a damp environment, it will go bad. Jars must therefore be sealed airtight or vacuum-packed in order to eliminate any possibility of contamination.

The writer wants to complete the sentence with information conveying that honey can be affected by organic processes.
A) NO CHANGE
B) it is collected from both domesticated and wild bees.
C) it is eaten by a wide range of species other other than humans.
D) it is still subject to the laws of nature.

What follows the word "conveying" in the question? Honey can be affected by organic processes. So organic processes is our key phrase. The correct answer must be consistent with it, or rephrase it in some way.

Let's start with A). Even if you don't know what adverse means, the phrase consumed in excess allows you to make an educated guess that this word is negative. In any case, don't get distracted by unfamiliar vocabulary. Instead, notice that this answer focuses on how too much honey affects people, not on how honey is affected by something. It's a subtle but crucial distinction, and it allows you to eliminate A).
B) No. Domesticated and wild bees are completely off-topic.
C) No. Slightly off-topic. Being consumed by a wide range of species isn't quite the same thing as being affected by organic processes. Besides, the fact that honey will go bad if left unsealed does not logically follow from this statement. Even though the question does not explicitly instruct you to take into account the information that comes after, you must do so regardless.
D) Yes. Subject to the laws of nature $=$ affected by organic processes. This answer essentially rephrases the key phrase from the question. In addition, it logically sets up the following statement. A substance that was subject to the laws of nature would not be completely immune to spoilage. Instead, it would go bad under certain conditions, just like any other type of food. D) is thus correct.

# Exercise: Adding, Deleting, and Revising (answers p. 239)

1. Over the course of the 1950 s, as television began to pervade popular culture, game shows became a fixture in the entertainment world. Daytime game shows were played for lower stakes to target stay-at-home housewives, while 1 some contestants won prizes worth thousands of dollars. During the latter part of the decade, viewership of high-stakes games such as Twenty One and The $\$ 64,000$ Question began to increase rapidly. However, that popularity proved to be short-lived. In 1959, many of the higher stakes game shows were found to be rigged. 2

Which of the following provides the most effective transition to the information that follows?
A) NO CHANGE
B) people who worked during the day had little interest in game shows.
C) women began to enter the workforce in greater numbers during the 1960s.
D) shows with higher stakes aired in the evening.

At this point, the writer is considering adding the following sentence

As a result, ratings declined, and most of the shows were cancelled.
Should the writer do this?
A) Yes, because it indicates a consequence of the discovery that game shows were rigged.
B) Yes, because it introduces a counterargument that provides a new perspective.
C) No, because it does not provide an example of a high-stakes game show.
D) No, because it disturbs the paragraph's focus on lower-stakes game shows.

2. I The air traffic control system is an organization of people and equipment designed to ensure the safety of private and commercial air travellers. Air traffic controllers are responsible for ensuring a smooth flow of arrivals and departures, and they also monitor all aircraft that enters the airport's airspace. With the assistance of radar and visual observation, these controllers observe and supervise the movements of each plane in order to maintain a safe distance between aircrafts. They also advise pilots of potentially dangerous weather changes such as "wind shear," 2 sudden, aircraft-affecting changes in wind velocity or direction.
3. In 1883, Theodore Roosevelt traveled to the North Dakota badlands. It was a voyage that changed his life. Roosevelt had always loved the outdoors, but 1 the voyage convinced him that the natural world deserved protection. After his inauguration as president of the United States in 1901, he became even more dedicated to wilderness conservation. In 1903, he interrupted a national speaking tour to spend two weeks camping in

Which choice most effectively establishes the main topic of the paragraph?
A) NO CHANGE
B) Many air traffic controllers are free to carry out their jobs with little supervision.
C) Air traffic controllers possess superior visual memories.
D) Although they are often referred to as flight controllers, most air professionals prefer to be called air traffic controllers.

The writer is considering deleting the information after "wind shear" and ending the sentence with a period. Should that information be deleted?
A) Yes, because it does not explain how different types of aircraft are affected by wind shear.
B) Yes, because it provides a counterpoint to the explanation in the passage.
C) No, because it defines a term that is likely to be unfamiliar to readers.
D) No, because it explains how changes in wind velocity and direction affect aircrafts.

Which choice provides the most effective transition to the information that follows?
A) NO CHANGE
B) he found the trip somewhat unpleasant.
C) he decided to turn his attention to politics. rather than nature.
D) most nineteenth-century politicians preferred more elegant surroundings.

Yellowstone National Park. He also visited the Grand Canyon to call for its protection. Later, he traveled to Yosemite, where he and the naturalist John Muir slept out under the stars for three nights.

4. For almost 40 years after the end of World War II, the work of Ernest Everett Just, an African-American biologist known for his studies of marine creatures, lay forgotten. Then, in 1983, Kenneth R. Manning, a professor of the history of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, published a prize-winning biography titled *Black Apollo of Science: The Life of Ernest Everett Just*. Since that time, Manning has written several other important books. The United States Post Office issued a stamp commemorating him, numerous conferences were held in his honor, and scientific journals published special issues dedicated to him.

The writer wants to include another example to support the idea that Theodore Roosevelt was committed to protecting nature. Which choice most effectively accomplishes that goal?

A) NO CHANGE

B) Two of his homes became part of the National Park service.

C) He passed legislation creating 150 National Forests and five National Parks.

D) His face was carved into the side of Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.

The writer is considering deleting the underlined phrase (adjusting the punctuation as necessary). Should that information be deleted?

A) Yes, because the paragraph does not focus on Just's research.

B) Yes, because Kenneth Manning was not a professor of marine biology.

C) No, because it provides contextual information about Ernest Everett Just.

D) No, because Ernest Everett Just influenced Kenneth Manning's marine biology research.

The writer wants to complete the sentence with information emphasizing the positive impact of Manning's biography on Just's legacy. Which choice most effectively accomplishes that goal?

A) NO CHANGE

B) A number of events have been organized to bring increased attention to Just.

C) The history of science has become a popular field of study.

D) Many important discoveries have been made in marine biology.

5. 1 Paper-making is an ancient art, dating back to second century China. In just a few months, I accumulated piles of books, photos and posters, not to mention stationery and greeting cards, all over my house. I had always been an avid traveler and photographer, but now brightly colored photographs covered my bedroom, my living room, and my office. 2 Then, I discovered the budding world of scrapbooking, 3 an art form that traces its roots to "commonplace" books in fifteenth century England. Suddenly, paper took on a whole new significance for me.
