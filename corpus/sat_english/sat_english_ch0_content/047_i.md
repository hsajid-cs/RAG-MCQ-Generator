## I

A) NO CHANGE
B) with
C) to
D) for

The phrase a familiarity always requires the preposition with. Any other preposition is idiomatically unacceptable. B) is thus correct.

Although memorizing idioms should not be your priority, some common ones are listed on the next page.

# Commonly Confused Words

The SAT also tests your ability to distinguish between homophones - words that are spelled differently and that have different meanings, but that are pronounced so similarly (or identically) in everyday speech that they are frequently confused in writing.

Questions testing these words may also test other concepts simultaneously, but the correct answer will largely depend on your ability to identify the correct version of the homophone pair.

While English contains many pairs of homophones, an analysis of released tests suggests that the College Board is partial to two particular sets: affect vs. effect, and than vs. then.

Affect - verb meaning "to impact"
Effect - noun meaning "an impact;" follows the or an, and is often followed by on*
As a shortcut, you can use RAVEN: Remember that Affect is a Verb and Effect is a Noun. Alternately, you can think that the last letter in the is the same as the first letter in effect: the effect.

Than - used to form comparisons
Then - next
Let's look at a test-style example:

For centuries, scientists believed in the existence of planets beyond the solar system (exoplanets) but had no way of knowing how common they were or how similar they might be to better-known planets. Beginning in the mid-1800s, some astronomers insisted that they had discovered exoplanets. However, their claims had little
1 affect on the scientific community until 1992, when the first exoplanet was positively identified.

A) NO CHANGE
B) affect to the scientific community
C) effect on the scientific community
D) effect, on the scientific community

Affect is a verb, but the word in question is followed by on, so effect must be used instead. That eliminates both A) and B). Note that the preposition to in B) is a decoy - you don't actually need to worry about the preposition at all, as long as you know that affect is wrong.

Both C) and D) correctly contain effect, but the comma before on is unnecessary and makes D) incorrect. That leaves C), which is the answer.

[^0]
[^0]:    *Note: it is technically possible for affect to be used as a noun and effect to be used a verb; however, these uses are exceedingly unlikely to be tested on the SAT and should not be a cause for concern.

- $\quad$ Supposed to, used to $=$ RIGHT; suppose to, use to $=$ WRONG

# To vs. -ING

On the SAT, the to form of a verb (infinitive) and the -ing form (gerund or participle) are sometimes switched with one another. (Note that the gerund vs. participle distinction is irrelevant here.)

If you see an -ing word underlined, plug in the to form and vice versa.
Incorrect: Even brief exposure to words associated with money seems to cause people to become more independent and less inclined helping others.

Correct: Even brief exposure to words associated with money seems to cause people to become more independent and less inclined to help others.

Unfortunately, to vs. -ing questions must be answered by ear. There is no rule and no trick to indicate which form should be used in a particular situation.

Note that when switching a to form with an -ing form, you must sometimes place a preposition before the -ing form in order for a sentence to be idiomatically correct.

For example:

Deactivated viruses form the basis of many vaccines known for their effectiveness 1 to prevent disease. As a result, people can be safely injected with genetic material from a virus without becoming ill themselves.
