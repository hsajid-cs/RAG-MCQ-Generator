2. When President James Polk officially confirmed 1 the discovery by James Marshall of gold at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California in 1848, hopeful prospectors immediately began planning for the trip out west. Beginning their journey in spring of 1849, 2 these prospectors took an overland route, known as "fortyniners," that was risky and mostly unknown. Some fortyniners traveled alone, but most formed companies that enabled 3 them with other miners to share expenses and supplies during the long journey. Seagoing travelers went south to Panama by boat. After disembarking, 4 a several-day mule ride to the Pacific coast was begun. When they finally arrived, they boarded a ship bound for San Francisco.
