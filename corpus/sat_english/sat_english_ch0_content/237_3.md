5. During World War II, a gasoline shortage forced many drivers to install power generators that converted wood into gas, a process known as gasification. The generators were clunky, but there was no alternative: motorists could either use them 1 and give up driving altogether. The generators were quickly forgotten once fossil fuels became readily available, but over 50 years later, gasification was rediscovered 6,000 miles away as a potential source of alternative power. All Power Labs, a California-based company, has slowly begun resurrecting this 2 more then century-old technology. In five years, the company has sold hundreds of generators known as "Power Pallets." Each pallet is approximately as large 3 as the size of a refrigerator and can produce clean fuel for about $15 \%$ of the usual cost. For countries with few natural resources, the pallets open up a whole new world of possibilities.
