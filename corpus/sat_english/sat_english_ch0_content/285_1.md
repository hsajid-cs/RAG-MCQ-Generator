It was in 2006 that Hackenberg realized something was amiss. For years, he had lent his bees to farmers, 2 whom used them to pollinate their crops. In 2006, he delivered 400 bee colonies to a Florida farm, but when he went to collect them, the bees were nowhere to be found. In the end, he lost about two-thirds of his hives. Although Hackenberg was distraught at first, he now considers himself lucky: some beekeepers 3 whom were less fortunate lost $90 \%$ of their bees. Now, scientists are curious to figure out just what is making so many bees disappear in places 4 which they were once found in abundance. The causes of CCD and the reasons for its increasing occurrence remain unclear, but many possibilities have been proposed: pesticides, infections, genetics, loss of habitat, radiation from electronic devices - or a combination of all these factors.
5. Having played a central role in helping the United States win its independence from Great Britain, George Washington quickly became a celebrity. Not surprisingly, he acquired many admirers, one 1 of who was Patience Wright. Wright, a sculptor, was known for her remarkably realistic 2 portraits, that were made out of tinted wax. She had always amused herself and her children by molding faces out of putty, dough, and wax, but thanks to a neighbor who encouraged her, she turned her hobby into a full-time occupation.

Wright loved her work, and those 3 whom watched her sculpt often commented on the energy that she brought to the process. In an era where photographs did not exist, skilled portraitists were held in high regard. Despite her lack of formal training, Wright was widely

recognized for her talents. By 1770 , she had become successful enough to open a waxworks house in New York City. When fire ravaged the New York studio in 1771, however, Wright decided to relocate to London. By that time, she had sculpted many famous figures and had even earned the support of the Queen of England, 4 which admired her work deeply. Still, though, she wasn't satisfied. To sculpt George Washington, a leader 5 to whom so many new Americans owed their deep gratitude, would be the crowning achievement of Wright's career.
