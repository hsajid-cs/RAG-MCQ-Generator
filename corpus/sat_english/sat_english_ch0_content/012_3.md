6. Body language is an important form of communication among the members of a wolf pack. For example, wolves may indicate dominant behavior by baring their teeth and pointing their ears forward. Subordinate behavior, on the other hand, may be indicated by closed mouths, narrowed eyes, and ears that are pulled back and held close to the head. And a wolf that stands with its ears sticking straight up or low and to the side, teeth bared, and a wrinkled snout, clearly communicates a threatening message - all of the surrounding wolves know to stay away. 1 Once they have reached maturity, most wolves leave their birth pack to search for a new territory or to join an existing pack.
7. Joseph Pulitzer loved politics, but 1 he had difficulty settling on a career. In 1878, the St. Louis Dispatch became available at a public auction for only $\$ 2,500$, and Pulitzer seized the opportunity to purchase it. John A. Dillon, owner of the Saint Louis Post, agreed to merge his newspaper with Pulitzer's, and so the St. Louis Post and Dispatch was created. The name was soon shortened to the Post-Dispatch, and the paper doubled to eight pages.

Although Pulitzer worked on every aspect of his paper, he was particularly involved in attacking corruption, which was rampant in St. Louis during the late nineteenth century. He considered his paper a vehicle for the truth, and he set about finding it with great energy. His stories exposed tax evasion, gambling rings, and 2 insurance fraud. Readers bought the paper in droves, increasing its circulation by the thousands.
