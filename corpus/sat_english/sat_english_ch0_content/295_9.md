Laliberté has also used his success to give back to his community - and the world. On October 29, 2007, Laliberté announced the official launch of the One Drop Foundation, an organization that fights poverty by giving people access to water. Inspired by the experience of Cirque du Soleil and its international program for street children, the foundation 10 makes use of theater, music, dance, and the visual arts to promote education, community involvement, and public awareness of water issues in developing countries on six continents. Its projects are also intended to ensure food security and promote equality for women. 11 Convinced that a comprehensive planetary approach is required to pursue its mission, One Drop puts water at the heart of public debate and international agendas.
