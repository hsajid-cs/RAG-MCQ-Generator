## Inserting Sentences

It is also possible that you will be asked to identify where in a passage a particular sentence should be added.

Please note that these questions have not (yet) appeared on any released exams; however, they are well within the scope of the test and do appear on the ACT English section, on which the redesigned SAT Writing and Language Test is based. As a result, I am covering them here for the sake of thoroughness.

Unlike Yes/No sentence insertion questions, which normally deal with only a limited section of a passage or paragraph, these questions may ask you to consider various places in multiple paragraphs. Unless you happen to remember the passage exceptionally well, plugging the sentence into each spot listed in the answer choices and working by process of elimination is usually the most effective way to answer these questions.

That said, you can still follow some basic steps upfront to make the process go more smoothly and avoid confusion:

1) When you read the sentence to be inserted, take a moment and restate the topic for yourself. This will be the key word or phrase.
2) Then, when you go back to the passage to plug in the sentence, check to see whether the surrounding sentences are consistent with that key word or phrase.
3) Eliminate any answer inconsistent with that focus.

Because a full passage is required to look at one of these questions, an example is included on p. 35.

# Dividing Paragraphs

You could also be asked to identify the point at which a paragraph should be divided in two. Again, note that these questions have not (yet) appeared on any released exams, but it is also conceivable that one could appear. These questions essentially test your ability to recognize where a shift in topic occurs. As is true for sentence order questions, paragraph division questions are always accompanied by numbered sentences.

There are two primary ways that you can approach paragraph division questions. You can check the answer choices one by one, looking at each point in the passage and deciding whether a given answer fits in logically with the information before it or begins a new idea; or, you can simply read through the paragraph on your own and identify where it would make the most sense for a break to occur.

Though the first option may seem safer and easier, it can also be time consuming and increase the odds that you'll get stuck between two answers. The second option, in contrast, requires a bit more thought initially but is often faster in the end. It also significantly reduces the chances of your second-guessing yourself.

For an example, let's look at this version of our passage:
|1| Because of these qualities, along with a thickness that prevents wounds from becoming infected, honey has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. |2| The earliest recorded use comes from Sumerian clay tablets, which indicate that honey was used in more than a quarter of all prescriptions. |3| The ancient Greeks and Egyptians also used honey regularly in ointments for skin and eye diseases. |4| Today, honey-based treatments are used around the world. |5| The medical device company Derma Sciences sells MediHoney, bandages covered in honey, to hospitals in over 25 countries. In fact, honey has been shown to prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens such as E. coli. |6| The benefits of this treatment aren't just folklore either: studies have shown that certain types of honey contain anti-inflammatory properties. |7| Whether its applications are confirmed by science or passed down through tradition, honey is as useful as it is delicious.

In the existing version, the paragraph has two different focuses: it discusses the historical uses of honey in medication and then switches to a discussion of a modern honey-based treatment. The shift takes place in sentence 4, where the writer signals this change with the word today. So the answer is C).

# Paragraph Order

Questions about paragraph order are rare and do not appear on every test. That said, you should be comfortable working through them in case you do encounter one on the actual exam.

These questions test the same essential skill as those testing sentence order, only on a larger scale. As is the case for sentence order questions, you must determine whether a particular paragraph is logically placed where it is, or whether it would make more sense elsewhere in the passage.

While questions testing paragraph order ask you to consider more information than most other question types do, you do not need to reread the entire passage to determine whether the existing placement of a paragraph is correct. Rather, a few key places will usually give you all the necessary information.

If you can consistently answer paragraph order questions correctly simply by plugging the paragraph in question into the spot indicated by each answer choice, you may feel more comfortable continuing to work this way. That said, doing a few seconds of work upfront (if you can stand it) generally reduces some of the potential for confusion.

If you are comfortable trying to answer paragraph order questions on your own, you should break them into the following steps:

1) Reread the paragraph in question, paying particular attention to the first (topic) sentence. Reiterate the topic for yourself in a word or two, and jot it down quickly.
2) Back up and read the last sentence of the previous paragraph, and ask whether yourself whether it leads naturally into the topic of the paragraph in question. If it does, you're done. If not:
3) Skim through each paragraph, looking for a mention of that topic. You do not need to read, just look for the word(s). The paragraph in question should belong next to that paragraph.

Because we really need to look at a complete passage to see how these questions work, a version of our sample passage is reprinted in full on the following page.
