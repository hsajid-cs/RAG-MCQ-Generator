## F. Missing or Ambiguous Antecedent

When a pronoun refers to a noun that is missing or unclear, it is necessary to add the specific person, place, or thing in order to remove the ambiguity.

For example:

Daniel Liebeskind and Frank Gehry are among the most celebrated architects in the world. I He is known for using unconventional building materials such as corrugated metal to create tilted geometrical structures.

I
A) NO CHANGE
B) Their known
C) Gehry is known
D) He would be known

Because Daniel and Frank are both male names, it is unclear which one he refers to. A) and D) can be eliminated.

Because the first sentence contains two names, many people will instinctively want to correct the sentence by making the underlined pronoun plural. The problem is that the only plural pronoun is in the wrong form: their, not they're. B) can thus be eliminated as well.

Although it keeps the construction singular, C) is correct because it supplies a specific name and removes the ambiguity.

Important: given the choice between a pronoun and a noun naming a specific person or thing, the noun will virtually always be correct - even if it appears in the longest answer.

For example:

Produced by the Boston-based startup
Superpedestrian, a new device called the Copenhagen
Wheel can be slipped onto any bicycle to provide an electronic boost. With a 350 -watt motor and a 48 -volt lithium battery, it can produce more than four times the energy created by regular pedaling. 1 They can use a smartphone to unlock and lock it, change gears, and select how much assistance the motor should provide.

A) NO CHANGE
B) Bicycle riders
C) He or she
D) These

The passage describes a device that can be slipped onto any bicycle, so it makes sense that they would refer to bicycle riders. The problem is that the noun bicycle riders doesn't actually appear in the passage, and again, a pronoun must refer to a noun that actually appears. Only B) supplies the noun indicating exactly who can use a smartphone to control the device.

# G. This and That

The pronouns this and that, along with their plural forms, these and those, should be followed by a noun. When these pronouns appear alone, they tend to be ambiguous. As a general rule, you can assume that any answer in which one of these pronouns appears alone will be incorrect.

For example:

Over the last several decades, the Internet has fundamentally changed how we live, work, and play. From virtual classrooms to electronic banking to online gaming, many of our daily actions and interactions are now governed by the web. While 1 this has numerous benefits, it has some drawbacks as well.

A) NO CHANGE
B) that
C) these
D) this technology

Although the reader can reasonably assume that the word this refers to the Internet or to conducting daily activities online, the sentence does not actually spell that fact out. D) is correct because it includes a specific noun, and more specific is always better.

On rare occasions, you may also be tested on the noun following the pronoun. The correct answer will accurately rephrase information from the previous sentence, or previous part of a sentence, in a more general way. Incorrect answers, on the other hand, will provide a general noun that does not correspond to the specific information provided earlier.

For example:

Over the last several decades, the Internet has
fundamentally changed how we live, work, and play.
From virtual classrooms to electronic banking to online "gaming," many of our daily actions and interactions are now governed by the web. While these have numerous benefits, they have some drawbacks as well.
