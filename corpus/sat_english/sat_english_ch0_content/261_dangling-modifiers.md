## Dangling Modifiers

Sentences that include dangling modifiers are characterized by an introductory phrase that describes (modifies) the subject but does not name it. This phrase is always followed by a comma.

In addition, introductory phrases often - but not always - begin with -ing words (participles).
Whenever a sentence contains an introductory phrase, the subject must appear immediately after the comma. If the subject does not appear in that place, the modifier is dangling, and the sentence is incorrect.

Incorrect: Stretching from one end of the city to the other, the efficiency of the tram system often surprises both tourists and city residents.

The above sentence contains an introductory phrase that begins with an -ing word (Stretching from one end of the city to the other) and does not name the subject - it does not tell us what stretches from one end of the city to the other.

We must therefore ask ourselves what stretches from one end of the city to the other. When we look at the rest of the sentence, it is clear that this description can only refer to the tram system.

The words the tram system do not appear immediately after the comma, so the modifier is dangling. In order to fix the sentence, we must place the tram system (the subject) immediately after the comma.

Correct: Stretching from one end of the city to the other, the tram system often surprises both tourists and city residents with its efficiency.

Some modifiers will not begin with -ing words.
Incorrect: An elementary school teacher from Arkansas, increased funding and support for public libraries were what Bessie Boehm Moore advocated for.

Who was the elementary school teacher for Arkansas? Bessie Boehm Moore, not increased funding and support. So Bessie Boehm Moore, the subject, must be placed immediately after the comma.

Correct: An elementary school teacher from Arkansas, Bessie Boehm Moore advocated for increased funding and support for public libraries.

Watch out for the possessive version of the subject placed immediately after the introductory phrase. In general, any possessive noun placed immediately after an introductory phrase will be incorrect.

Incorrect: An elementary school teacher from Arkansas, Bessie Boehm Moore's goal was to achieve increased funding and support for public libraries.

Who is the elementary school teacher from Arkansas? Bessie Boehm Moore, not her goal.
Correct: An elementary school teacher from Arkansas, Bessie Boehm Moore had the goal of achieving increased funding and support for public libraries.

It is, however, acceptable to begin the main clause with a modifier describing the subject because that description is considered part of the complete subject.

Correct: A native of Arkansas, elementary school teacher Bessie Boehm Moore had the goal of achieving increased funding and support for public libraries.

Important: When fixing dangling modifiers, focus on identifying who or what the introductory phrase refers to - that is, the subject. The correct answer must place the subject right after the introductory material. In some cases, you may be able to identify the correct answer based on a single word.

For example:

Born Freda Josephine McDonald in a small Missouri town, I the majority of Josephine Baker's career was spent performing throughout Europe. In the 1920s, Baker took Paris by storm. Her jaw-dropping performances including one in a costume of 16 bananas strung onto a skirt - made her a celebrity. By 1927, she was one of the most photographed women in the world.
