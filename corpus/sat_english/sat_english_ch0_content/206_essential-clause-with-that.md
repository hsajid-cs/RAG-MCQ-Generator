## Essential Clause with "That"

Disagreements can also involve essential clauses beginning with that. As is true for disagreements involving non-essential clauses, errors can be placed around the essential clause or within it.

# B. Subject - Prepositional Phrase - Verb

As discussed earlier, a prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with a preposition (e.g., in the box, under the table, over the hill). Prepositional phrases are frequently inserted between subjects and verbs to distract from disagreements.

If you don't see an error the first time you read a sentence, take your pencil and cross out all prepositional phrases. Then check for subject-verb agreement. The last word of a prepositional phrase will always appear right before the verb, so be careful not to cross out verbs when crossing out prepositional phrases.

In the examples below, the subject is underlined, the prepositional phrase is italicized, and the verb is bold.
Incorrect: The patent for the first mechanical pencils were granted to Sampson Morgan and John Hawkins in England during the early nineteenth century.

Cross out: The patent for the first mechamical pencils were granted to Sampson Morgan and John Hawkins in England during the early nineteenth century.

Correct: $\quad$ The patent for the first mechanical pencils was granted to Sampson Morgan and John Hawkins in England during the early nineteenth century.

The above sentence contains a classic trick. The subject (patent) is singular and requires a singular verb (was). However, the prepositional phrase inserted between the subject and the verb has as its last word a plural noun (pencils). If you are not paying close attention, that plural noun can easily appear to be the subject of the plural verb were.
