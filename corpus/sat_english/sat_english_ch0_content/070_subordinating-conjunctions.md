## Subordinating Conjunctions

Somewhere around third grade, you probably learned that you should never start a sentence with because. While this rule is taught with the best of intentions, it's unfortunately only half right. In reality, it's perfectly acceptable to begin a sentence with because - sometimes.

Here's the rule: Because is a type of conjunction known as a subordinating conjunction. A clause that begins with a subordinating conjunction cannot stand on its own as a sentence and is therefore dependent.

Fragment: Because tomatoes are colorful and full of flavor.
If, however, an independent clause is placed after the dependent clause, the whole sentence can correctly begin with a subordinating conjunction.

Sentence: Because tomatoes are colorful and full of flavor, they are one of the most popular salad ingredients.

Other common subordinating conjunctions include the following:

| After | Before | Though | Whenever |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Although | Despite | Unless | Whereas |
| As | If | Until | Whether |
| Because | Since | When | While |

In the examples below, the incorrect version of each sentence contains only a dependent clause, while the correct version that follows contains a dependent clause followed by an independent clause.

Fragment: Although tomatoes have been cultivated since the first millennium B.C.
Sentence: Although tomatoes have been cultivated since the first millennium B.C., they did not become popular in the United States until the mid-nineteenth century.

Fragment: When tomatoes were first brought to Europe from South America.
Sentence: When tomatoes were first brought to Europe from South America, many people believed that the small yellow fruits were poisonous.

Note that when a clause begun by a subordinating conjunction contains a subject (underlined below), that clause must contain a conjugated verb rather than an -ing word.

Fragment: Most tomatoes grown today have smooth surfaces, although some older plants and most modern beefsteaks showing pronounced ribbing.

Sentence: Most tomatoes grown today have smooth surfaces, although some older plants and most modern beefsteaks show pronounced ribbing.

When no subject is present, however, an -ing word can acceptably appear in the same phrase as some subordinating conjunctions, primarily ones indicating time (e.g., while, when, before, after, since).

Sentence: Since becoming a central ingredient in Italian cooking during the nineteenth century, the tomato has grown in popularity worldwide.
