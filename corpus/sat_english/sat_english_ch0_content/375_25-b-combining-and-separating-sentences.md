## 25. B: Combining and Separating Sentences

The construction comma $+I$ in the original version is an immediate tip-off that a comma splice is present and that A) is incorrect. In fact, if you back up and read the entire sentence, you should notice that there are two full sentences, not one. That means the correct answer is going to require a full stop somewhere. A comma can never divide two sentences, eliminating A), C), and D) Although you might be expecting a semicolon or a period here, this question throws in a twist. In this case, the colon is used as the grammatical equivalent of a semicolon. A colon is appropriate here because the second sentence explains what the writer means by it wasn't easy. Note that although sometimes appears to make sense at the end of the first sentence, it also works as the beginning of the second sentence.
