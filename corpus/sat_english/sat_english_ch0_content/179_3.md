4. We inhabit a world of bridges. For thousands of 1 years, travelers, who needed to cross bodies of water, have been finding ingenious ways to do so. From the 3,000-year-old Arkadiko bridge in Greece to the brand-new 26.4 -mile structure connecting the Chinese port city of Quindao to 2 there suburbs, bridges are everywhere. The simplest type of bridge can be created by dragging a log over a creek, but the construction of modern bridges typically requires years of 3 education, today, architects, engineers, and artists may spend a decade or more working together to design a single structure.
5. In the world of airliners, bigger means better. The dawn of the jet age in the 1950s brought in the likes of the 1 Boeing 707; an aircraft capable of carrying more passengers more quickly than any propeller-driven design. Since that time, airliners have grown larger and larger. The sight of an Airbus A380 can still create great excitement. The 2 enormous double-decker plane can seat over 800 people. While the Airbus 380 is the largest passenger-carrying aircraft ever 3 built; it is dwarfed by another design that may someday take to the skies. With three decks for passengers, the AWWA Sky Whale looks like a cross between a tropical fish and a space shuttle from a science-fiction movie.
