## 2) Identify the subject, and determine whether it is singular or plural.

Remember that the noun right before a verb usually won't be the subject. If it were, the question would be too easy, and it wouldn't be on the test in the first place!

When an underlined verb is located close to the beginning of a sentence, the subject is typically right at the beginning of the sentence. So back up and look at the first words of the sentence: The works. That's your subject. Works ends in $-s$, so it's plural.

Alternately, if you really don't want to worry about grammar, you can think about it logically. What has included elements inspired by both the California gold rush and the transcontinental railroad? It can only be the works of artist Alan Chin. A person can't contain elements inspired by both the California gold rush and the transcontinental railroad.
