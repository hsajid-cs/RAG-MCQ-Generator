## 1. Verb

Verbs indicate actions or states of being.
Examples: To be
To have
To seem
To go
To study
To believe
The "to" form of a verb is known as the infinitive. All of the verbs listed above are infinitives. If you are uncertain whether a word can be used as a verb, try placing to in front of it to form an infinitive.

Verbs are not always used as infinitives. In order to indicate who is performing an action, we must conjugate the verb and provide its subject.

To be and to have are the most common English verbs. As a result, they are tested frequently on the SAT. Because they are irregular, their conjugated forms are different from their infinitives. To be is also unique in that it is conjugated in both the present and past. To answer many verb questions accurately, you must be able to recognize and distinguish between these verbs' singular and plural forms.
