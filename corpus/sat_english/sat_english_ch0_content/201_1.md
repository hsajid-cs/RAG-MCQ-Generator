A) NO CHANGE
B) includes
C) have included
D) having included

Whether or not you realize it, this question forces you to deal with the actual error. If you can't hear there's a problem and don't have the grammatical tools to figure it out, you're out of luck. You can probably recognize that D) is awkward and breaks the " -ing is bad" rule, but otherwise... you really have to guess.

Subject-verb agreement errors can be very difficult to hear, so when they occur in the original version of a passage, many students will quickly glance through the answer choices before picking NO CHANGE and moving on without a second thought. This is not what you want to do.

If you cannot identify the error immediately, the key to dealing with subject-verb agreement questions is to work backwards, using the answer choices to determine what the question is testing.

If you find yourself lost on a question involving verbs, you can follow these steps:

# 1) Look at the answer choices.

If you examine the answer choices to the question on the previous page, you can see that A) and B) contain singular verbs, has and includes, whereas C) contains a plural verb, have. You can assume that D) is probably incorrect because it contains an -ing word, which is likely to create a fragment.

When some answer choices contain singular verbs while other answer choices contain plural verbs, the question is testing subject-verb agreement.
