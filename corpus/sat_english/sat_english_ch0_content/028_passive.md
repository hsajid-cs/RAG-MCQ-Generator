## Passive

Hamlet was written by William Shakespeare.

Although it is not absolutely necessary that you master passive constructions because they are always longer than active ones, the ability to recognize them can be helpful. When the shortest answer appears in the passage, it can be difficult to identify visually; noticing passive constructions can allow you to eliminate other options.

For example:

During the Nimrod Expedition to the South Pole in 1907, I a group of explorers was led on a dangerous voyage by Ernest Shackleton.
