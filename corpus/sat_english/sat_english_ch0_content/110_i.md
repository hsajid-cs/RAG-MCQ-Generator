## I

A) NO CHANGE
B) friend, Jane
C) friend Jane,
D) friend Jane

Solution: The name is located within the sentence, indicating that our options are two commas or no commas. When we cross out Jane, the resulting sentence (Luckily, that friend agreed to come over the next day) still makes sense in context because the writer has already referred to a friend in the previous sentence. The name Jane adds specific information about the friend, but it is not essential to the meaning of the passage. Commas are therefore necessary, making the answer A).

Now let's look at an example of a question involving a title. We're going to revisit this passage, but from a slightly different angle:

Jamaica Kincaid (born May 25, 1949) is a novelist, essayist, and gardener. She was born Elaine Potter Richardson in St. John's, Antigua, but came to the United States at the age of 17 to work as an au pair in Westchester County, New York. She eventually won a scholarship to Franconia College in New Hampshire but returned to New York City to write. In 1985, she published 1 the novel, Annie John, a semiautobiographical story of a young girl growing up in Antigua.
