## I

A) NO CHANGE
B) Because the Antarctic Peninsula
C) While the Antarctic Peninsula
D) The Antarctic Peninsula

Although and while are synonyms, allowing for easy elimination of A) and C).
If you jump to pick D), however, you'll get into trouble. In reality, this option creates a comma splice (The Antarctic Peninsula and the surrounding islands have milder temperatures and liquid water, more species can thrive there). So in this case, the "no transition" option is not correct.

The two parts of the sentence do, however, convey a cause-and-effect relationship, which corresponds to B).

# Revising Information

You could also be asked to revise part of a sentence so that it corresponds logically to a transition.
For example:
Conditions in the interior of Antarctica are inhospitable to many forms of life: sub-zero temperatures, high winds, and extreme dryness make it impossible for most animals to survive. The Antarctic Peninsula and the surrounding islands have milder temperatures and liquid water, but I more animals can thrive there.
