2. When Jordan Romero was in elementary school, he became intrigued by a painting that hung in his classroom. The painting 1 showed and depicted seven of the world's highest mountains - one for each continent - and Jordan made up his mind to climb them all. Remarkably, he 2 achieved an attainment of that goal when he reached the top of the Vinson Massif at the age of fifteen years, five months, and twelve days, becoming the youngest climber ever to summit the tallest mountain on each continent. In the process, Romero also became the youngest person to scale Mt. Everest, reaching the top when he was not even 14 years old 3 and earning the title of the youngest person to climb Mt. Everest.
