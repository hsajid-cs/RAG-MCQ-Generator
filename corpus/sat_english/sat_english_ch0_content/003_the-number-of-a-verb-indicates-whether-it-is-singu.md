##

The number of a verb indicates whether it is singular or plural. I, she, he, it and one are always singular, and we and they are always plural. You can be either singular or plural.

Note that third-person singular verbs end in $-s$, whereas third-person plural verbs do not end in $-s$, e.g., it works, they work. SAT verb questions also focus on this distinction.

The tense of a verb indicates when an action occurred.

| It was $=$ Simple past | It will be $=$ Future |
