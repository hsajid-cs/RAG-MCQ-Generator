A) NO CHANGE
B) The envelope marked "Alaska Commercial Company,"
C) The envelope, marked "Alaska Commercial Company,"
D) The envelope, marked "Alaska Commercial Company"

Solution: In this version, the passage clearly indicates that Goforth found many envelopes. The description marked "Alaska Commercial Company" is essential because it specifies which one of the envelopes Goforth found. No commas are therefore needed, making A) correct.

# Commas with Names and Titles

Names and titles can be either essential or non-essential. While you may have learned that a comma should always be placed before a name or title, that is not the whole story. Commas should sometimes be placed before - and after - names and titles. Other times, no commas at all should be used. It all depends on the context.

Important: When a name or title appears in the middle of a sentence (that is, not as the first or last words), there are generally only two correct options: 1) two commas, one before and one after the name or title; or 2) no commas at all. (Occasionally, a single comma may be required after the name or title for reasons discussed later in this chapter.)

The simplest way to determine whether commas are necessary is to treat the name or title like any other non-essential word or clause: take your pencil, cross it out, and see if the rest of the sentence makes sense in context without it. If the sentence makes sense, the commas are necessary; if the sentence does not make sense, the commas are not necessary.

Let's look at how this rule would play out in some test-style questions:
