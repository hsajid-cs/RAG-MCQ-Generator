6. Ever since scientists discovered that the fingerprints of each person on earth 1 was unique, fingerprinting has played an important role in law enforcement. Modern fingerprinting has come a long way from the time when police officers 2 lift prints from a crime scene and check them manually. Fingerprints are now used in many ways: to prevent forged signatures, confirm job applicants' identities, and provide personalized access to everything from ATMs to computer networks. Modern fingerprinting techniques can not only check millions of criminal records in a few seconds, but they 3 have also matched faces and other identifiable characteristics specific to each perpetrator.
7. When I recently traveled to Colombia to see my extended family, I had the opportunity to visit a variety of interesting and unique sites. One of my favorite attractions 1 were the National Coffee Theme Park, an amusement park located just south of the town of Montenegro. The park, which can be reached from cable cars, 2 features a global coffee garden, a roller coaster, coffee-based food stalls, and many examples of Colombian folk architecture. It consists of two main areas: by the entrance 3 is the buildings housing the museum and exhibitions, and in the valley beyond is an amusement park with rides and shows. The museum includes exhibits on coffee farming and harvesting, and the amusement park offers over 20 rides and attractions. The two areas are linked by a cable car, but it is also possible to walk between them via an ecological trail that 4 pass through a plantation of coffee bushes.

8. The construction of prefabricated houses is based on the assembly-line model of car manufacturing developed by Henry Ford. In the 1920s, Ford's production method for the Model T 1 transforms the automobile from a luxury item into a purchase that was affordable for the average consumer. Today, assembly-line production and bulk buying 2 has driven down the cost and construction time for prefabricated homes. The production process 3 has evolved significantly since the first prefabricated homes were build at the turn of the twentieth century, and houses can now be constructed in only a matter of weeks. Furthermore, a number of potential additions now 4 allows buyers to customize their homes. Just as satellite radios and heated seats can be added to cars, Jacuzzis and crown molding can be added to prefabricated houses.
