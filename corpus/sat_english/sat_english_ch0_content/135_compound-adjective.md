# F. Before or Around "Self" Words

"Self" words (formally known as emphatic pronouns) are used to emphasize that particular people or things are being referred to. Each object pronoun has an emphatic counterpart, e.g., me, myself; it, itself; them, themselves.

Although constructions containing these words may sound strange to you, there is nothing inherently wrong with them. In fact, the only thing you need to know is that it is incorrect to place a comma before a "self" word, or before and after one.

Incorrect: The Tower of London, which lies within the Borough of Tower Hamlets, is separated from the city, itself by a stretch of open space.

Incorrect: The Tower of London, which lies within the Borough of Tower Hamlets, is separated from the city, itself, by a stretch of open space.

Correct: The Tower of London, which lies within the Borough of Tower Hamlets, is separated from the city itself by a stretch of open space.

In most cases, it is also incorrect to place a comma after an emphatic pronoun.
Incorrect: The Tower of London, which lies within the Borough of Tower Hamlets, is separated from the city itself, by a stretch of open space.

However, when a comma would normally be necessary (e.g., before a FANBOYS conjunction or to set off a non-essential clause), it is acceptable to place a comma after an emphatic pronoun.

Correct: The Tower of London is separated from the city itself, but it is nevertheless one of London's most popular tourist attractions.

In the sentence above, comma + but is used to separate two complete sentences. The first sentence just happens to end with the word itself.

# 11 <br> Colons and Dashes

Colons should be used in two situations:

1) Before a list
2) Before an explanation

Important: the information before a colon must be a sentence that is able to stand alone as a complete thought, but the information after a colon can be either a sentence or a fragment.

Shortcut: any answer that places a colon before such as or including is almost certainly incorrect.
