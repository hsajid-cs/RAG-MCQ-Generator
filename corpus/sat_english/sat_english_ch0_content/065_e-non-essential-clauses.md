## E. Non-Essential Clauses

Information can be inserted between the subject and the verb in the form of a non-essential clause.
Sentence: The tomato, which is one of the most popular salad ingredients, grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

Non-essential clauses describe nouns (usually the subject). They often begin with "w-words" such as who and which, and they are usually followed by a verb. They can consist of long phrases or single words:

Sentence: The tomato, however, grows in many varieties in greenhouses around the world.
These clauses or words are called "non-essential" because when they are removed, the sentence still makes grammatical sense.

Fragment: The tomato, which is one of the most popular salad ingredients, and it grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

Sentence: The tomato, which is one of the most popular salad ingredients, grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

# Appositives

Although non-essential clauses frequently begin with "w-words" (also known as relative pronouns), they are not required to do so. You could also see a non-essential clause that looks like this:

The tomato, one of the most popular salad ingredients, grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

A non-essential clause that begins with a noun is known as an appositive. Appositives can also appear as descriptions at the beginnings or ends of sentences, as in the examples below.

Beginning: A popular salad ingredient, the tomato grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

End: In greenhouses around the world grow many shapes and varieties of the tomato, a popular salad ingredient.

A non-essential clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. As a shortcut, know that a statement (not a question) beginning with a "w-word" such as which, who(se), or where is not a complete sentence.*

Fragment: Which is one of the most popular salad ingredients
Fragment: Who think that the tomato is a vegetable
Sentence: One of the most popular salad ingredients, the tomato grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

In addition, a sentence cannot stop right after a non-essential clause. If it does, it is no longer a complete sentence but rather a fragment, and it should not have a period or semicolon placed after it.

Fragment: The tomato, which is one of the most popular salad ingredients
Fragment: The tomato, one of the most popular salad ingredients
Although the first version does contain the verb is, that verb does not correspond to the subject, the tomato. Instead, it corresponds to the pronoun which at the beginning of the new clause. In order to create a sentence, we can remove which, restoring the verb to its proper subject, the tomato.

Sentence: The tomato is one of the most popular salad ingredients.
Alternately, we can place a main verb after the non-essential clause and complete the sentence with additional information.

Sentence: The tomato, (which is) one of the most popular salad ingredients, grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

[^0]:    *The only exception to this rule invoives cases in which a "w-word" functions as a subject, e.g., Where the meeting would be located was a subject of intense debate. Although this usage is rare, you should be aware that it is acceptable.

Every verb has two participles:
