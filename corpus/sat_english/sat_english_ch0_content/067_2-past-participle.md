## 2) Past participle

The past participle is usually formed by adding $-e d$ or $-n$ to the verb

| Talk | $\rightarrow$ | talked |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Paint | $\rightarrow$ | painted |
| Throw | $\rightarrow$ | thrown |

A participial phrase begins with a participle and can be in either the present or the past.
Let's get back to our sentence - now we're going to add a participial phrase at the beginning, using the present participle originating.

Correct: Originating in South America, the tomato, one of the most popular salad ingredients, grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

To form the past tense, we can use the present participle having + past participle of the main verb (originated).

Correct: Having originated in South America, the tomato, one of the most popular salad ingredients, grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

We can also use the past participle of the verb grow.
Correct: Grown originally in South America, the tomato, one of the most popular salad ingredients, is now produced in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

Participial phrases can appear in the beginning (as in the above examples), middle, or end of a sentence.
Middle: The tomato, cultivated initially in South America during the first millennium B.C., is now grown in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

End: The tomato is now grown in greenhouses around the world, having first been cultivated in South America in the first millennium B.C.

Participial phrases cannot stand alone as sentences, however.
Fragment: Originating in South America
Fragment: Having first been cultivated in South America in the first millennium B.C.
Fragment: Grown originally in South America
Fragment: Grown originally in South America, the tomato, one of the most popular salad ingredients

Gerunds are identical in appearance to present participles: they are created by adding -ing to verbs. Whereas participles act as modifiers, gerunds act as nouns. They typically follow pronouns, e.g., I was irritated by his whistling, or prepositions, e.g., The gannet is a bird that catches fish by diving from heights of up to 100 feet.

At this point, however, the most important thing to understand is a word that ends in -ing is not a verb. A clause that contains a subject and an -ing word rather than a conjugated verb is a fragment.

Fragment: Tomatoes growing in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world
In order to turn the fragment into a sentence, we must eliminate the gerund by conjugating the verb.
Sentence: Tomatoes grow in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world
Important: Answer choices that contain BEING (gerund of to be), are usually wrong. In addition to creating fragments, the use of being often leads to wordy and awkward constructions.

Being is also irregular - the conjugated forms of the verb look completely different from the gerund form. In order to easily correct errors with being, you should make sure to know all of the conjugated (third person) forms of the verb to be.

|  | Present | Past |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Singular | Is | Was |
| Plural | Are | Were |
