## Question Marks

Note: question marks have been tested on only one released exam (Test 7, \#32), but because they can be considered fair game for future tests, I am including a brief chapter on them.

On the SAT, question marks are tested in a way that can be surprisingly tricky, especially if you're not paying close attention. That way involves direct and indirect speech.

Direct speech does exactly what its name implies: it asks questions directly. Note that in this construction, the entire statement consists of the question itself.

Correct: When Orson Welles' War of the Worlds was broadcast as a radio play in 1938, some listeners asked themselves the following question: is this a piece of theater or a live broadcast?

Although the question here is clearly linked to the first part of the sentence in terms of meaning, it is a separate element that makes sense grammatically on its own. A question mark is therefore necessary.

In indirect speech, however, a question is embedded in a longer sentence, and no question mark is used. Very often (but not always), this construction involves clauses begun by whether or if.

Correct: When Orson Welles' War of the Worlds was broadcast as a radio play in 1938, some listeners could not tell whether/if it was a piece of theater or a live broadcast.

In this case, the section of the sentence that expresses uncertainty cannot be detached from the larger sentence. As a result, it is a statement rather than a question, and a period must be placed at the end of it.

Now let's look at a test-style example:

If you spend time in a room with people who are yawning, it is almost certain that you will eventually join them. The only question is whether you'll begin to yawn immediately I or manage to resist for a minute or two?

I
A) NO CHANGE
B) and manage to resist for a minute or two?
C) or manage to resist for a minute or two.
D) and manage to resist for a minute or two.

Because the underlined portion is embedded in a longer sentence, a period rather than a question mark is required. A) and B) can thus be eliminated. D) is also incorrect because it creates an illogical meaning: someone who begin[s] to yawn immediately cannot also resist for a minute or two. That makes C) the answer.

# Apostrophes: Plural vs. Possessive

| Singular | Plural (-s, -es) | Singular Possessive (-'s) | Plural Possessive (-s') |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Scientist | Scientists | Scientist's | Scientists' |
| Business | Businesses | Business's | Businesses' |

To form the plural of a noun, add $-s$. When a singular noun ends in $-s$, add $-e s$. Do not add an apostrophe.
Correct: The birds are flying. $=$ More than one bird is flying.
Correct: The businesses are open. $=$ More than one business is open.
To form the possessive of a singular noun, add apostrophe $+-s$, even for nouns whose singular ends in $-s$.*
Correct: The bird's wings are red. $=$ The wings of the bird are red.
Correct: The business's policy is new. $=$ The policy of the business is new.
To form the possessive of a plural noun, add an apostrophe after the $-s$ or $-e s$.
Correct: The birds' wings are red. $=$ The wings of the birds are red.
Correct: The businesses' policies are new. $=$ The policies of the businesses are new.

Some nouns are irregular - that is, their plural forms are not formed by adding -s to their singular forms.

| Singular | Plural |
| :--: | :--: |
| Child | Children |
| Fish | Fish |
| Foot | Feet |
| Mouse | Mice |
| Person | People |
| (Wo)man | (Wo)men |

[^0]
[^0]:    *Note: For well-known names ending in $-s$, the possessive can be formed by adding only an apostrophe (e.g., Dickens' works $=$ the works of Dickens). This exception accounts for much of the confusion surrounding apostrophes. You do not, however, need to worry about it for the SAT.

# To form the possessive of a singular irregular noun, add apostrophe +- s , just as you would for a singular regular noun.

Correct: The mouse's whiskers = The whiskers of the mouse.
Correct: The woman's books = The books belonging to the woman.
To form the possessive of a plural irregular noun, also add apostrophe +- s .
Correct: The mice's whiskers = The whiskers of the mice.
Correct: The women's books = The books belonging to the women.
Note that because the plural forms of these nouns are already different from the singular forms, the identical placement of the apostrophe $+-s$ does not create confusion.
