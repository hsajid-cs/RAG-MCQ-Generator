## I

A) NO CHANGE
B) we
C) they
D) you

If you just read the sentence with the underlined pronoun on its own, you probably wouldn't see anything wrong. A look at the previous sentences, however, reveals that they contain the pronoun you. That means that the pronoun in this sentence must match. D) is thus correct.
