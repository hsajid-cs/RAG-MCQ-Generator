## I

A) NO CHANGE
B) a voyage of a dangerous sort.
C) a voyage whose nature was dangerous.
D) a voyage that was dangerous in itself.

Notice that in this case, the shortest/correct answer is also in the passage and is thus easier to overlook. As a rule, you must make sure not to forget the original version when considering length.

The shortest answer can be even easier to overlook when all of the options are relatively long. Answers that stretch over multiple lines tend to be perceived more as a single mass, and so differences in appearance do not register visually in quite the same way. This is particularly true for "combining sentences" questions. For instance, consider the example below. The fact that D), the correct answer, is two words shorter than the next-shortest answer (C) would most likely not jump out at the casual reader.
