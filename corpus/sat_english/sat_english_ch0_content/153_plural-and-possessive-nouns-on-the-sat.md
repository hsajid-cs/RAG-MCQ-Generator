## Plural and Possessive Nouns on the SAT

Questions testing plural vs. possessive nouns occur less frequently than ones testing plural vs. possessive pronouns, but they do appear from time to time. Although these questions may seem complicated, they are actually fairly straightforward.

Either one or two nouns can be underlined, with the answers providing various combinations of possessives and plurals. The passage below contains an example of each question type.

An artists' colony is a place where creative
1 practitioner's live and interact with one another. Colonies often select their artists through an application process, and residencies range from a few weeks to over a year. Since colonies such as MacDowell and Yaddo were founded in the early $20^{\text {th }}$ century, they have exhibited hundreds of 2 artist's works and provided important spaces for collaboration and experimentation.

A) NO CHANGE
B) practitioners
C) practitioners'
D) practitioner's,

A) NO CHANGE
B) artists works
C) artist's work's
D) artists' works

Even if you were able to answer the questions on the previous page easily, you should still pay attention to this section because it provides some important tools for breaking down plural vs. possessive questions. Remember that you will be taking this portion of the exam after the 65 -minute Reading Test. When you are fatigued, normally straightforward concepts can become surprisingly tricky - no matter how well you understand them.

Shortcut: A noun followed by another noun should contain an apostrophe, whereas a noun followed by any other part of speech should not contain an apostrophe. When you think about it, this is only logical: the only thing a noun can possess is another noun.

For example, an apostrophe is required in the phrase researchers' results because researchers' is followed by another noun, results. On the other hand, no apostrophe should be used in the phrase researchers believe because believe is a verb, not a noun.

Note that this rule can be applied even when a single noun is underlined. You just need to look at the nonunderlined word that follows the underlined portion. For example, let's consider the first question from our passage:

An artists' colony is a place where creative
1 practitioner's live and interact with one another. Colonies often select their artists through an application process, and residencies range from a few weeks to over a year. Since colonies such as MacDowell and Yaddo were founded in the early $20^{\text {th }}$ century, they have exhibited hundreds of 2 artist's works and provided important spaces for collaboration and experimentation.
