## "Skimming" Graphs

Although infographic questions look different from other questions, they are still vulnerable to some of the same techniques that can be used elsewhere. For example, you should be careful about relying excessively on the answer choices. As always, incorrect options will be written to sound plausible and thus to confuse you. It is therefore very much in your interest to start by doing some basic work upfront. Having a bigpicture understanding of the information in the chart may allow you to eliminate several answers right away, and it will likely help you to identify the correct answer more quickly and securely.

Just as you can skim texts to get a general idea of what they are saying, you can also "skim" graphs visually to get a general sense of the information they convey.

Here are some questions to consider:

- What is the shape of the graph? Does the curve go up, down, or both?
- Are changes steady from point to point, or is there a big jump somewhere? If so, where?
- Is there an "outlier" point with a value very different from the other values?

Any choice that clearly contradicts the general trend of a graph can be immediately eliminated.

Let's start by looking at the following example. Although the question is marked as usual, we're going to hold off on looking at all the answers for now and just focus on understanding the graph itself.

Biotechnology has become one of the strongest sectors for overall job growth in the United States as well as in other nations. Because of aging populations and the need for increased drug effectiveness and safety, biotechnology has extended its reach into many medical fields, including biological research, agriculture, and pharmaceutical development. Some regions of the United States, particularly those with strong research sectors, have experienced considerable growth in the number of biotechnology jobs. The Raleigh-Durham "research triangle," home to Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, saw a significant rise in biotechnology jobs in a variety of areas. For example, 1 the number of biotechnology jobs in the research and laboratory sector tripled between 2002 and 2014. In the coming years, the biotechnology industry will continue to add new sectors, further increasing the demand for workers.

Research and Laboratory Sector Jobs: Raleigh-Durham, 2002-2014
- Number of research and laboratory jobs, in thousands

The first thing we're going to do is make sure we understand the pieces of the graph as well as the relationships among them. If we have a clear picture of what's going on upfront, we'll be a lot less likely to get confused by the answer choices.
The title indicates that the chart will convey information about the number of research and laboratory jobs in the Raleigh-Durham area between 2002 and 2014. That might seem very obvious, but it's actually very, very important because it's giving us the chart's scope - that is, how broad or narrow it is.

In this case, the chart is relatively narrow: it focuses on one specific field or sector of biotechnology (research and laboratory jobs), not on all biotechnology sectors, and on one specific region (RaleighDurham), not on the entire United States. That is crucial because any answer choice that includes information beyond those "boundaries" will be incorrect. We cannot, for example, draw conclusions about research and laboratory jobs in other regions, or in the United States as a whole, or about biotechnology jobs outside the research and laboratory sector. Incorrect answer choices may play on those concepts.

The $x$-axis (horizontal) contains years in chronological order. The earliest year is 2002, and the latest is 2014. The points between them represent the interceding years. The graph does not contain information from every single year, but rather from every other (even) year. So we have information from 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010, but not from 2005, 2007, 2009, etc.

The $y$-axis (vertical) is a little bit trickier. It contains numbers in increments of five; however, the note at the bottom of the chart tells us that the bars of the graph represent research and laboratory jobs in thousands. As a result, 5 actually means $5,000,10$ means $10,000,15$ means 15,000 , etc. Why not just write the numbers out next to the $y$-axis? Well, because those are pretty large numbers, and they take up a lot of space. It's easier and clearer without all those zeroes.

Next, we consider the overall trend suggested by the graph: the numbers steadily rise from 2002 to 2014, with a quick dip in between (2008). The increase from 2002 to 2014 is significant, but not staggeringly huge.

So now that we have a pretty good idea of what the graph is about, we're going to work through a full sample question and see how to apply all that information.

The Raleigh-Durham "research triangle," home to Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, saw a significant rise in biotechnology jobs in a variety of areas. For example, 1 the number of biotechnology jobs in the research and laboratory sector tripled between 2002 and 2014. In the coming years, the biotechnology industry will continue to add new sectors, further increasing the demand for workers.
# I

Which choice offers an accurate interpretation of the data presented in the chart?
A) NO CHANGE
B) the number of biotechnology jobs in all sectors increased between 2002 and 2014.
C) after 2006, the number of research and laboratory jobs increased during every two-year period.
D) around 15,000 more research and laboratory jobs existed in 2014 than existed in 2002.

The original version states that research and laboratory jobs tripled between 2002 and 2014. That's a very large increase. Just by glancing at the graph, we can see that the 2014 bar, while significantly higher than the 2002 bar, isn't three times as high. In fact, the number of jobs in 2002 was somewhere around 18,000, while the number is 2014 was just over 30,000 . The number of jobs almost doubled; it didn't come close to tripling. So A) is out.

We can, however, use our calculation from A) to identify the correct answer. D) states exactly what we just determined, namely that the number of jobs increased by around 15,000 . So D) is correct.

Notice the switch in terms: A) is phrased in terms of tripling, whereas D) provides an actual number. In order to avoid confusion, you must be comfortable moving between the two types of terminology.
B) is incorrect because its scope is too broad. Remember that the graph only covers the research and laboratory sector, but here the answer refers to all sectors. C) is incorrect because it states that the number of research and laboratory jobs increased during every two-year period after 2006, but the number decreased in 2008. Notice the extreme language (every, all) present in B) and C). You should be suspicious of this type of phrasing because graphs will often reveal exceptions to general trends.

Now let's look at a slightly more complex example:

Water is a precious resource. Although it flows freely from the tap, it's not infinite. As institutions housing thousands of students, colleges and universities consume enormous amounts of water in order to maintain lawns, airconditioned dorms, and clean plates in dining halls. Now, however, college campuses are becoming home to some of the most innovative water conservation ideas. They are implementing water management technology, smart conservation policies, and more. At Drexel University, for example, rainwater is recycled for non-potable uses, including toilet flushing, landscaping, and gardening. Other schools have had mixed results, however. At the University of Southern California, I water consumption at the Health and Sciences campuses declined from 2007 to 2009, while it rose at the University Park campus.
Which choice offers an accurate interpretation of data presented in the chart?
A) NO CHANGE
B) water consumption at the University Park campus decreased from 2007 to 2009 , although it rose at the Health and Sciences campus.
C) water consumption at both the University Park and Health and Sciences campuses decreased after peaking in 2007.
D) water consumption at the University Park campus decreased every year between 2005 and 2009, while it rose at the Health and Sciences campus.

Whereas the previous graph only asked you to consider how the number of jobs changed over time, this graph requires you to compare two separate factors: the amount of water used at the Health and Sciences Campus, and the amount used at the University Park Campus.

If you think that sounds complicated, don't worry! We can "skim" this graph too - we just have to make sure not to confuse the information presented in each bar color.

The first thing we can notice is that the two sets of bars show two very different stories. Any answer choice stating that they are similar will therefore be wrong. That eliminates C).

Next, we can notice that the bars for the Health and Sciences campus (dark gray) are a lot lower than the bars for the University Park Campus (light gray). The bars for the Health and Sciences campus also go up slightly over time; they do not drop at all. Any answer stating that water consumption decreased at the Health and Sciences campus must therefore be wrong. That eliminates A).

We can also notice that the bars for the University Park campus (light gray) go up significantly, then drop. So any answer that mentions water consumption only increasing or decreasing is wrong. That eliminates D).

The only remaining answer is B), which is correct.

# Stacked Graphs

Some of the graphs you encounter on the SAT may also be in "stacked" form - that is, a single bar may convey information about more than one entity. When this is the case, you must be able to distinguish between the points on the graph where a particular color begins and ends, and the overall quantity indicated by that color.

For an illustration of that concept, we're going to take a look at the graph below:
Each bar in the above graph represents the market share of not one but three separate companies during a particular year. The bottom color (dark gray) directly corresponds to Microsoft's market share in each year listed. In 2012, for instance, the bar stretches from 0 to about 30 (halfway between 20 and 40), indicating that around $30 \%$ of handheld device sales involved Microsoft products.

# In order to interpret the top two colors in each bar, however, we must perform some simple calculations.
The middle bar (light gray, Apple) begins at about $30 \%$ and goes to about $50 \%$. The difference between 30 and 50 is 20 , so the graph is indicating that $20 \%$ of handheld device sales in 2012 involved Apple products.

Likewise, the medium-gray portion of the graph ("Other") begins at about $50 \%$ and stretches to the top, indicating that about half of handheld device sales in 2012 involved products not manufactured by Microsoft or Apple. Although that is a very straightforward quantity, it is less obvious than it would be if the bar were split evenly between two colors, or if the number 50 appeared in the $y$-axis.

Incorrect answers to questions testing these types of graphs are likely to play on the confusion between the lines where particular sections of a bar start/stop and the actual amounts they represent.

For example, take a look at the question below. Choices A) and B) are both based on this type of confusion.

Which choice offers an accurate interpretation of data presented in the chart?
A) In 2012, about half of handheld device sales involved Apple products.
B) In 2016, more than $60 \%$ of handheld device sales involved products not manufactured by Apple or Microsoft.
C) Between 2008 and 2016, the percentage of handheld device sales involving Apple products declined.
D) The percentage of handheld devices sales involving Microsoft products was more than twice as large in 2008 as in 2012.

In A), it is true that the bar for Apple does stop right around the $50 \%$ mark; however, that $50 \%$ represents the combined sales of Apple and Microsoft. As we saw, the actual figure for 2012 Apple sales is $20 \%$.
B) plays on the proximity between the start of the "Other" section and the $60 \%$ mark. In reality, the bar begins at just under $60 \%$, so "Other" sales actually comprise just over $40 \%$ of the total. If you were confused about the graph's organization, you could potentially misinterpret the medium-gray bar as ending just above the $60 \%$ mark rather than just below it.
C) plays on the size vs. location of the light-gray bar (Apple). Although it is situated much higher up in the graph in 2008, that location has nothing to do with the amount sold. The key factor is the height of that portion, which is larger in 2012 and 2016, indicating that sales rose rather than declined.

Note that D), the correct answer, does not cite specific figures from the graph at all. Rather, you must perform some basic calculations involving information not explicitly labeled on the graph. In 2008, the bar for Microsoft (dark gray) extends from zero to about $70 \%$ (not labeled). In 2012, it extends from 0 to about $30 \%$ (again, not labeled). 30 is less than half of 70 , so it is accurate to say that Microsoft sales in 2008 were more than twice as high as Microsoft sales in 2012.

# Non-Graph Graphics

Finally, you should be aware that the SAT occasionally includes infographics that are not in traditional bargraph form. Because the format of these graphics varies, there is no real way to study for them, nor is there any reliable way to predict which type might occur on a particular exam. Before you start to worry, though, you should know that any non-standard graph that appears will be relatively straightforward and selfexplanatory. Although you may need a few extra seconds to figure out how the graphic works, you should keep in mind that all the information you need is right in front of you.

That said, we're going to take a look at one example:

A discipline for managing information technology systems, information technology service management (ITSM) is centered on the client's needs. This approach stands in contrast to the technology-centered approaches that often leave clients confused and frustrated. As the graphic indicates, I a Help Desk provides large-scale structure, while Strategy Management, Customer Support, and a Service Desk play secondary roles.
