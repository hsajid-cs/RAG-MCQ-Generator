## D. Emphatic Pronouns

"Self" words, e.g., himself, itself, and themselves, can correctly be used to emphasize either people or things. Just make sure that they agree with the noun they are intended to emphasize.

Incorrect: What has been criticized is the author's refusal to discuss her work publicly, not the quality of the writing herself.

Correct: What has been criticized is the author's refusal to discuss her work publicly, not the quality of the writing itself.

Because the writing (thing) rather than the author (person) is the noun emphasized here, itself should be used.

# E. Noun Agreement

Nouns themselves must also agree in number: singular subjects must be paired with singular nouns, and plural subjects must be paired with plural nouns.
