## 6. Adverb

Adverbs modify verbs, phrases, and other adverbs. Many common adverbs end in -ly (e.g., slowly, loudly, strongly), but the SAT is primarily concerned with conjunctive adverbs: adverbs that serve as transitional words.

Although many of these words have the same meaning as conjunctions, they can only be used at the beginning of a sentence or clause.

Examples: however, therefore, thus, hence, moreover, indeed, furthermore, subsequently

- Holland was once home to 10,000 windmills; however, only 1,000 remain today.
- The surface of Mars is covered with iron-rich minerals; therefore, it appears red.
