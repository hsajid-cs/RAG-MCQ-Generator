## Parallel Structure with Multiple Sentences

So far we've looked at parallel structure within a single sentence. The SAT, however, may also test your ability to recognize and preserve/create parallel structure when more than one sentence is involved. Although these questions may initially seem very complicated, they can actually be relatively simple to answer - that is, if you know what information to focus on.

For example:
An actor stands on the stage and delivers a monologue as an audience hangs onto his every word. A singer performs a ballad as listeners fall silent. I As a group of spectators watch in awe, dancers glide across the stage.

Which choice best maintains the sentence pattern already established in the paragraph?
A) NO CHANGE
B) Watched by a group of spectators, dancers glide across the stage.
C) Gliding across the stage, dancers are watched by a group of spectators.
D) Dancers glide gracefully across the stage as spectators watch in awe.

Remember that the question is asking us to look at the pattern already established in the paragraph. That means we're going to look at the preceding sentences before we consider the underlined sentence. We can't do anything until we know what we're looking for.

Let's start by considering just the beginning of the first two sentences:

- Sentence \#1: An actor...
- Sentence \#2: A singer...

Each of those sentences begins with a noun. That means the third sentence must start with a noun as well. Only D) places a noun right at the beginning of the sentence, so it must be correct.

You can also think of it this way: the first two sentences have the basic structure noun + as + noun (An actor stands...as an audience, A singer performs...as listeners). The third sentence must therefore contain that structure, in that order. The original version flips the order so that as comes first. B) and C) do not even contain the word as. That leaves D), which correctly contains the structure noun + as + noun.

1. Spiders are predators. In the insect world, they're fearsome animals - the tiny equivalent of wolves, lions, 1 or acting like sharks. Spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey, including trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, and 2 to mimic other insects in order to avoid detection. Trap door spiders dig holes, 4 covering them up with doors made of spider silk and lying in wait for passing prey.
2. Copy editors review documents for errors in grammar, punctuation, and 1 how words are spelled. They suggest revisions such as changing words and 3 to rearrange sentences and paragraphs to improve clarity or accuracy. They also may carry out research, confirm sources for writers, and 4 will verify facts, dates, or statistics. Finally, they may arrange page layouts of articles, photographs, and advertisements.
