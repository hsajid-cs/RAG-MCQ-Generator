## "Strong" Transitions

Certain transitions (formally known as conjunctive adverbs) are considered "strong" enough to begin a sentence. The ones on which you are most likely to be tested include however, therefore, thus, consequently, moreover, and nevertheless.

When used to begin a clause, these transitions should always follow a period or semicolon, never a comma.

Incorrect: The tomato is one of the most popular salad ingredients, however, it is actually a fruit.

Correct: The tomato is one of the most popular salad ingredients; however, it is actually a fruit.

Correct: The tomato is one of the most popular salad ingredients. However, it is actually a fruit.

Very important: No matter where the underlined portion of a sentence starts, make sure to back up and read from the beginning all the way through to the period. Otherwise, you might not notice that there are two sentences rather than one.

Let's look at an example:

Since the early nineteenth century, doomsayers have gloomily predicted that increasing populations would exhaust their food 1 supplies in only a few decades, they claimed food shortages would result in catastrophic famines. Yet the world currently produces enough food to feed 10 billion people, and there are only seven billion of us.

A) NO CHANGE
B) supplies. In only a few decades, they claimed,
C) supplies, in only a few decades, they claimed
D) supplies in only a few decades they claimed,

Because the underlined phrase initially seems to make sense where it is, many test-takers will immediately pick NO CHANGE and move on to the next question without a second thought. (If you did that, don't worry - it just means you're normal.) What they will not do is read all the way to the period after the word famines. Take a moment now, and just read the entire sentence in isolation:

Since the early nineteenth century, doomsayers have gloomily predicted that increasing populations would exhaust their food supplies in only a few decades they claimed food shortages would result in catastrophic famines.

Can you spot the problem now? If the phrase in only a few decades is left without any punctuation, the sentence is far too long. In fact, there are two sentences, not one:

Sentence \#1: Since the early nineteenth century, doomsayers have gloomily predicted that increasing populations would exhaust their food supplies in only a few decades.

Sentence \#2: They claimed food shortages would result in catastrophic famines.
As discussed, two complete sentences must be divided by a period or a semicolon, not a comma (more about that in a little bit). The only answer that divides the sentence into two is B). When the underlined phrase is attached to the beginning of the second sentence rather than the end of the first, the sentences make perfect sense.

Sentence \#1: Since the early nineteenth century, doomsayers have gloomily predicted that increasing populations would exhaust their food supplies.

Sentence \#2: In only a few decades, they claimed, food shortages would result in catastrophic famines.

So B) is correct.
As a general rule, it is a good idea to check answer choices that contain periods first. When you are given the option to use a period, there is a significant chance that there are two sentences rather than one.

# B. Comma + Coordinating (FANBOYS) Conjunction

As discussed in the previous chapter, complete sentences can also be joined by comma + coordinating conjunction. These conjunctions are also known by the acronym FANBOYS: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So.

To reiterate, the two most common FANBOYS conjunctions are and \& but. They should be your primary concern, but you should be aware of the others as well.

When a FANBOYS conjunction is used without a comma to join two sentences, the result is a run-on sentence. Note that a sentence does not have to be long to be a run-on.

Run-on: Tomatoes are used in many different types of cooking and they are grown around the world in both fields and greenhouses.

Correct: Tomatoes are used in many different types of cooking, and they are grown around the world in both fields and greenhouses.

Likewise, a FANBOYS conjunction should not be used after a period or a semicolon.* Any answer choice that contains a FANBOYS conjunction after a period or semicolon can be eliminated.

Incorrect: Tomatoes are used in many different types of cooking. And they are grown around the world in both fields and greenhouses.

Incorrect: Tomatoes are used in many different types of cooking; and they are grown around the world in both fields and greenhouses.

When the subject is the same in both clauses and is not repeated in the second clause, do not use a comma:
Incorrect: Tomatoes are used in many different types of cooking, and are grown around the world in both fields and greenhouses.

Correct: Tomatoes are used in many different types of cooking and are grown around the world in both fields and greenhouses.

You can also think of the above rule this way: because comma $+a n d=$ period, simply replace comma + and with a period, and see if you have two complete sentences:

Incorrect: Tomatoes are used in many different types of cooking. Are grown around the world in both fields and greenhouses.

Because the statement after the period is not a sentence, no comma should be used before and.

[^0]
[^0]:    *Although this construction is technically incorrect, it is generally considered acceptable when used for occasional stylistic effect. For that reason, correct answers to rhetoric/style (not grammar!) questions could plausibly begin with FANBOYS conjunctions.

# Very Important: Semicolon $=$ Period $=$ Comma + FANBOYS

Because a period, a semicolon, and a comma + a FANBOYS conjunction are grammatically identical, you will never be asked to choose among them. When more than one of these constructions appear as answers, you can eliminate all of them because no question can have more than one right answer.

For example:

If you grow tomatoes to sell at a 1 market, remember that it will take about 70 to 80 days from the time you set plants in the field until you can pick ripe tomatoes from them.
