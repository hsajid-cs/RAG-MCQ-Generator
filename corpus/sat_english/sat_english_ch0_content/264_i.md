## I

A) NO CHANGE
B) During the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, pigeons were used by the French military to transport messages to Paris
C) Pigeons were used to transport messages to Paris during the Franco-Prussian War in 1871
D) In 1871, during the Franco-Prussian War, the French military using pigeons to transport messages to Paris

Punctuation aside, this is exactly the same question as before. But because parentheses imply that information is unimportant, you are more likely to overlook them as a key source of information. In reality, the rule is exactly the same as it is when only a comma is present: the parenthetical information begins with a time, so the section that precedes it must end with 1871. Again, C) is correct.

This concept could also be tested the other way around:

Pigeons have long played an important role as messengers, as a result of their homing ability, speed, and altitude. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, the French military used pigeons to transport messages to Paris I (a time when the city was surrounded by Prussian troops).
