## A. Present Progressive

Present progressive $=$ is/are + -ing, e.g., she is throwing, they are reading, it is growing
This tense is used to emphasize that an action is happening right at the moment. It can be considered parallel to a verb in the simple (no -ing) present.

For example:
Correct: $\quad$ Engines powered by ions can travel great distances and are currently carrying satellites beyond our solar system.

# B. Present Perfect

Present perfect $=$ has/have + past participle, e.g., has walked, has gone, have thrown

- Usually formed by adding -ed to the verb. (For common irregular past participles, see p. 184.)
- Used for actions that began in the past and that are continuing into the present.
- Most important irregular verb $=$ to be, which becomes has been (sing.) and have been (pl.).

The words for, since, over, and during usually act as tip-offs that the present perfect is required. For example:
Incorrect: Since around 500 B.C., people cultivate/cultivated tomatoes in Mesoamerica.
Correct: Since around 500 B.C., people have cultivated tomatoes in Mesoamerica.
The present perfect is also commonly used to describe an action that occurred very recently.
Correct: Scientists have reported that the breakthrough may result in the development of new technologies.

While answers to most verb questions depend on the surrounding sentences, questions involving the present perfect are more likely to depend only on the sentences in which they appear.

For example:

Computer and information specialists collaborate with a variety of workers. They coordinate activities with management executives, equipment suppliers, and all other contractors. Since the 1990s, computer and information systems manager occupations I have expanded more quickly than have other occupations. As technology evolves, more employees will be necessary to guide this process. Those with a Master's degree in business technology and management will be most qualified for these opportunities.

Although the previous sentences contain verbs in the present tense (collaborate, coordinate), and the following sentences contain verbs in the future (will be), the tip-off word since requires that the underlined verb be in the present perfect. A) is thus correct.

# C. Simple Past

Simple past $=$ verb + -ed, e.g., talked, played, painted

- Describes a finished action in the past.
- Usually identical to the past participle, e.g., she has walked and she walked. For a list of common irregular past participles, see p. 184.
- Most important irregular verb $=$ to be, which becomes was (sing.) and were (pl.).

Dates and time periods are usually tip-offs that the simple past is required.
Correct: Around 500 B.C., the inhabitants of Central America began to cultivate the first tomatoes.

Correct: During the Middle Ages, many members of the nobility lived in castles.
