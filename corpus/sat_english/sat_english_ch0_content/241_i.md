## I

A) NO CHANGE
B) they accumulate chemical fertilizers
C) accumulating chemical fertilizers
D) accumulation of chemical fertilizers

The underlined portion of the sentence uses an infinitive (to accumulate) to begin the third item in the list, whereas the other items in the list begin with nouns (changes, runoff). A noun is required, so D) is correct.

If an entire list is underlined, you can simplify the question by focusing on the beginning of each item.
For example:

1 Changes in wind circulation, runoff from sewage, and they accumulate chemical fertilizers can lead to the creation of ocean waters low in oxygen and inhospitable to marine life.
