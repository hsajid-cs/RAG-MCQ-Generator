## C. Between Adjectives, When the First Modifies the Second

If the first adjective modifies the second adjective, OR if two adjectives could not normally be separated by the word and, no comma should be used.

Incorrect: Created in Jamaica during the late 1960s, reggae music emerged from a number of sources ranging from traditional, African songs and chants to contemporary jazz.

Correct: Created in Jamaica during the late 1960s, reggae music emerged from a number of sources ranging from traditional African songs and chants to contemporary jazz.

In the above sentence, traditional modifies African songs. In addition, you would not say traditional and African songs. As a result, no comma should be used between the adjectives.

# D. Between Subjects and Verbs

Unless a subject and verb are separated from one another by a non-essential clause, no comma should be placed between them.

Incorrect: Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, were two of the most influential figures in the history of computer science and mathematics.

Correct: $\quad$ Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage were two of the most influential figures in the history of computer science and mathematics.

This rule holds true even when subjects are extremely long and complex, as in the example below. Even though you may feel that a pause is necessary, in strict grammatical terms, no comma should be used.

Incorrect: What is particularly remarkable about Ada Lovelace's work on Charles Babbage's "analytical engine," is that Lovelace foresaw many of the ways in which computers are used today.

Correct: What is particularly remarkable about Ada Lovelace's work on Charles Babbage's "analytical engine" is that Lovelace foresaw many of the ways in which computers are used today.
