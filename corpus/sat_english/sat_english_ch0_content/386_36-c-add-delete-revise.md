## 36. C: Add/Delete/Revise

What is the paragraph about? It introduces the topic of dreaming and discusses the fact that dreams are still pretty mysterious. What is the sentence in question about? The origins of dream interpretation, which the rest of the paragraph does not discuss. So the sentence is off-topic and should not be added, making C) correct.
