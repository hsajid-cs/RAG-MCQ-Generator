## D. Past Perfect

Past perfect $=$ had + past participle, e.g., he had gone, it had rung, they had insisted

- When a sentence refers to two finished actions, the past perfect is used to describe only the action that happened first.

Important: the phrase by the time is a tip-off that the past perfect is required.
For example:

Martha Graham, an American dancer and choreographer, is known as one of the foremost pioneers of modern dance. Building upon the foundation of turn-of-the-century dancer Isadora Duncan, Graham brought this art form to a new level with her introduction of dance techniques that at first horrified and then later won over the American public. By the time she retired from the stage in 1970, she 1 gave hundreds of performances and permanently altered the course of dance in the United States.
