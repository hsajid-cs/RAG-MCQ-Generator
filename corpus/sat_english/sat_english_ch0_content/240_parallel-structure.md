## Parallel Structure

Parallel structure (also known as parallelism) is the repetition of a particular grammatical construction within a sentence or paragraph. It is used to indicate that multiple ideas have equal levels of importance. In addition, the use of parallel constructions makes writing clearer and easier for readers to follow.

In any given list of three or more items, each item should appear in the same format: noun, noun, and noun; gerund, gerund, and gerund; verb, verb, and verb. Any deviation is incorrect.

For example:
