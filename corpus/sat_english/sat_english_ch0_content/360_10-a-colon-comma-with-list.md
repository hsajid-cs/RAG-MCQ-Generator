## 10. A: Colon, Comma with List

The information before the list cannot be a standalone sentence, so no colon should be used after of, and commas should be placed between the items of the list. That makes A) correct. B) can be eliminated because commas and semicolons should not be mixed to separate items in a list. (Although semicolons can technically be used to separate long items in a list, this usage is unlikely to appear on the SAT; for the purposes of the test, they should only be used to separate two sentences.) C) can be eliminated because the information before the colon is not a standalone sentence; the fact that it is followed by a list is irrelevant. And D) can be eliminated because there is simply no reason to place a dash (or any punctuation) between the word and and the last item of the list.
