10. By turning the camera on herself, Cindy Sherman established her reputation as one of the most respected photographers of the late twentieth century. The majority of her photographs are pictures of herself; I as such, these photographs are most definitely not self-portraits. Rather, Sherman uses herself as a vehicle for commentary on a variety of issues of the modern world: the role of the woman, the role of the artist, and many more. It is through these ambiguous and eclectic photographs that Sherman has developed a distinct signature style. 2 In addition, she has raised important and challenging questions about the role of women in society and the nature of artistic creation.
