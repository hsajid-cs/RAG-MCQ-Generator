## H. That, What, or Whether as a Subject = Singular

All of these words can be used as subjects, although that construction might strike you as very odd. That $=$ the fact that; whether/what $=$ the question of whether/what.

Correct: That Jane Goodall became the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees was hardly a surprise to those who had observed her childhood fascination with animals.

# I. Indefinite Pronouns

Indefinite pronouns refer to unspecified nouns. They are used to indicate amounts and can take either singular or plural verbs.

| Singular | Plural | Singular or Plural |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| None* | Few | Neither |
| No one | Both | Some |
| Any | Several | More |
| One | Many | Most |
| Each | Others | All |
| Every | A number |  |
| Another |  |  |
| Much |  |  |
| The number |  |  |

If you encounter these pronouns on the SAT, they are likely to be followed by prepositional phrases (italicized below). Don't get distracted by a noun in the prepositional phrase and mistake it for the subject.

Incorrect: When any (one) of the committee members propose a new regulation, the committee discusses it thoroughly and then takes a vote.

Correct: When any (one) of the committee members proposes a new regulation, the committee discusses it thoroughly and then takes a vote.

When ( $n$ )either and ( $n$ )or are paired with two nouns, the verb must agree with the noun before the verb.
Correct: Neither Amy Tan nor Maxine Hong Kingston was raised in a literary family, but both became avid readers while growing up near San Francisco.

When ( $n$ )either is not paired with ( $n$ )or and is used with two singular nouns, a singular verb should also be used. In this usage, neither is short for neither one, and one is singular by definition.

Correct: Both Amy Tan and Maxine Hong Kingston became avid readers while growing up near San Francisco, but neither was raised in a literary family.

When some, more, most, and all are paired with of + singular (pro)noun, they take singular verbs.
Correct: The state of Florida was the site of some of the first European settlements in North America, yet most of it was unpopulated until the nineteenth century.

However, when these pronouns appear alone or are paired with of + plural (pro)noun, they take plural verbs.
Correct: Although members of the Algonquin tribe obtained food primarily through hunting and fishing, some (of them) were also farmers who raised corn, squash, and beans.

[^0]
[^0]:    * In everyday writing, none and, less frequently, any are often paired with plural verbs, although that use is technically incorrect. You can assume that if the SAT tests these pronouns, only singular verbs will be considered right.

# Verb Tense

Correct answers to tense questions are primarily based on context. Several options may be acceptable on their own, but only one answer will be correct in the passage. Unless there is a clear reason for the tense to change, a verb should be parallel to the other verbs in sentence or paragraph. As a result, you will often need to read the surrounding sentences in order to obtain enough information to answer tense questions.

For example:

The tomato is consumed in many different ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes and sauces, and in drinks. Botanically a fruit, it I was considered a vegetable for culinary purposes. It belongs to the nightshade family, and its plants typically grow from three to ten feet high.
