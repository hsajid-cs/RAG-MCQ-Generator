5. Rainbows can be observed whenever there are water drops in the air and sunlight shining from behind the observer. They are usually 1 seen in a visible way in the western sky during the morning, and in the eastern sky during the early evening. The most spectacular displays occur when half the sky is still dark with rain clouds and the observer is at a spot with clear sky in the direction of the sun. The result is a 2 luminous rainbow that contrasts with the dark background.

The rainbow effect can also be artificially created 3 unnaturally when water droplets are dispersed into the air during a sunny day. Rarely, a moonbow, a nighttime rainbow, can be seen 4 during the night. Because human color perception is poor in low light, moonbows are often perceived as white.
