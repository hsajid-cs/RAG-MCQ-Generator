4. As the world's first supersonic passenger jet, the Concorde was regarded as a marvel of engineering. Most jets fly at maximum speeds of about 550 miles per hour, but the Concorde 1 could have gone more than two times as fast - double the speed of sound. During its 27 years of service, the world's fastest commercial aircraft transported passengers across the Atlantic ocean in only two hours.

Although the Concorde was retired in 2003, a plane that is capable of flying halfway around the world in a mere four hours might soon exist. For engineers, eliminating sonic booms 2 have been one of the biggest challenges involved in building the new craft. Airplanes that break the sound barrier are extremely loud, so they must be flown primarily over water. Engineers claim, however, that they have found a way of reducing the amount of noise the planes 3 makes. The solution involves thinner wings and hidden engines. Moreover, lightweight materials and innovative engine technology 4 allow the plane to fly twice as fast as the Concorde.

5. In North America, cranberries were cultivated by Native Americans long before the first European settlers arrived, but not until the mid-nineteenth century
1 was the first berries marketed and sold. Sometime around 1800, the British scientist Sir Joseph Banks used seeds from the United States to harvest cranberries in England, but Banks 2 did not market his crop. Then, in 1816, Henry Hall, a veteran of the Revolutionary war, planted the first recorded commercial cranberry bog in Dennis, Massachusetts.

By the mid-nineteenth century, the modern cranberry industry was in full swing, and competition among growers 3 were fierce. The business operated on a small scale at first: families and individuals harvested wild cranberries, selling them locally. As the market 4 grows to include larger cities such as Boston and New York, farmers competed to unload their surplus cranberries quickly. What was once a local venture 5 has become a highly profitable business.
