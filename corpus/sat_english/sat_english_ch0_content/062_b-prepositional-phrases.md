## B. Prepositional Phrases

If we want to make our sentence a little longer, we can add a prepositional phrase. A prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with a preposition, a time or location word that comes before a noun. Common prepositions include in, to, with, from, for, at, by, and on. (For a complete list, see p. 11.)

Sentence: The tomato grows around the world.
Sentences can contain many prepositional phrases, sometimes one after the other.
Sentence: The tomato grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

A prepositional phrase can also be placed between the subject and the verb. When that is the case, the prepositional phrase starts at the preposition and ends right before the verb.

Sentence: The tomatoes in the greenhouse grow in many varieties and colors.
A prepositional phrase can also be placed at the beginning of a sentence.
Sentence: In the greenhouse, the tomatoes grow in many varieties and colors.
A prepositional phrase cannot, however, stand alone as a complete sentence.
Fragment: In the greenhouse
Fragment: In many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world

# C. Pronoun as Subject

Nouns can also be replaced by pronouns: words such as it, she, and they. For example, in the sentence The tomato grows, we can replace the subject, tomato, with the singular pronoun it:

Sentence: It grows.
This is actually still a sentence because it has a subject (it) and a verb that corresponds to the subject (grows). The only difference between this version and the version with the noun is that here we don't know what the subject, it, refers to.

This is where a lot of people run into trouble. They assume that if a statement doesn't make sense out of context, then it can't be a sentence. But again, those two things are not necessarily related.

As is true for the original version, we can rewrite the longer versions of our sentence using pronouns.
Sentence: It grows around the world.
Sentence: It grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.
If we wanted to make the subject plural, we could replace it with the plural pronoun they.
Sentence: Tomatoes grow.
Sentence: They grow.
Sentence: They grow in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.
It and they are the most common subject pronouns (pronouns that can replace nouns as the subject of a sentence), but many other pronouns can also be used as subjects. Some of them can refer only to people; some can refer only to things; and some can refer to both people and things.

| People | Things | People or Things |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| I | It | None |
| You | Nothing | One |
| S/he | Anything | Each |
| We | Everything | Every |
| No one | Something | Any |
| Anyone/anybody |  | Few |
| Someone/somebody |  | Both |
| Everyone/everybody |  | Some |
|  |  | Several |
|  |  | Many |
|  |  | More |
|  |  | Most |
|  |  | Other(s) |
|  |  | All |
|  |  | They |

# "Group" Pronouns

One very common point of confusion often involves "group" pronouns such as some, several, few, many, and others. These pronouns can be used to begin clauses in two different ways, one of which creates an independent clause and the other of which creates a dependent clause.

Let's start with these two sentences:
Sentence: Many tomatoes are grown in greenhouses around the world.
Sentence: Most people believe that the tomato is a vegetable.
People generally don't have too much trouble recognizing that these are sentences. They have pretty clear subjects (many tomatoes, most people) and verbs (are, believe), and they make sense by themselves. The problem arises when we take away the nouns, tomatoes and people, and start to deal with the pronouns on their own.
