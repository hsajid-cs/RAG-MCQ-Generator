## 3) Find the verb that agrees with the subject.

Works is plural, so a plural verb is required. Only C) contains a plural verb (have), so it is correct.
Notice that although B) contains a verb in one tense (includes), while A) and C) contain verbs in other tenses (has/have included), you do not need to worry about tense at all in order to answer the question correctly. The only thing that matters is subject-verb agreement. The fact that different answers contain different tenses is simply a distraction technique designed to make questions look more complicated than they actually are.

# Subject-Verb Agreement

At least one question testing subject-verb agreement is virtually guaranteed to appear on each test, so you should be familiar with the various ways in which disagreements can be constructed.

These questions ask about verbs in the third-person singular (she/he/it/one) and third person plural (they) because these forms have the highest potential for confusion.

The most important thing to remember about the singular vs. plural forms of a verb is as follows:

- Singular verbs end in $-s$ (e.g., it makes)
- Plural verbs do not end in $-s$ (e.g., they make)

Note that this is the opposite of nouns, which take an $-s$ in the plural and no $-s$ in the singular. For example, the book is singular, and the books is plural; however, he speaks is singular, and they speak is plural.
