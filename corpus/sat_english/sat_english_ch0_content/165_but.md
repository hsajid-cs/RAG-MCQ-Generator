Incorrect: Orville Wright, along with his brother Wilbur, are considered inventors of the airplane.

Correct: Orville Wright, along with his brother Wilbur, is considered an inventor of the airplane.

Notice that this example contains a non-essential clause after Orville Wright. If that clause is removed, the error reveals itself: Orville Wright...are considered inventors of the airplane. Clearly that does not make sense. Orville Wright, the true subject of the sentence, was one person and therefore an inventor.
