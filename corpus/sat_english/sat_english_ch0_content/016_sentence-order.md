## Sentence Order

When you encounter a sentence order question, you should first determine the topic of the sentence in question. Then, ask yourself whether it follows logically from the previous sentence and connects to the following sentence. If not, reread the paragraph from the beginning, checking to see where else that specific topic appears. The sentence in question almost certainly belongs either right before or right after.

For example:
|1| Bees also contribute significantly to this distinctive trait. [2| Nectar, the first material collected by bees to make honey, is made up primarily of water anywhere from 60 to $80 \%$. [3| In addition to this behavior, the chemical makeup of a bee's stomach plays a large part in honey's resilience. [4| During the honeymaking process, however, the bees remove much of this moisture by flapping their wings. [5| When the bees regurgitate the nectar from their mouths into combs to make honey, an enzyme called glucose oxidase mixes with the nectar. [6| The result is hydrogen peroxide, which is thought to promote healing.

To make this paragraph most logical, sentence 3 should be
A) where it is now
B) after sentence 1 .
C) after sentence 4 .
D) after sentence 5 .

We're going to break down this question and answer it step by step.

# What is sentence 3 about?

The fact that the chemical composition of a bee's stomach contributes to honey's durability. In addition, the phrase this behavior at the beginning of sentence 3 indicates that this sentence must be placed after a sentence describing a behavior of bees.
