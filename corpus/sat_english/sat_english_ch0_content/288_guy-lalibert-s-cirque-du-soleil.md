## Guy Laliberté's Cirque du Soleil

Guy Laliberté is an accordionist, stilt-walker, and fire-eater. He's also the founder of Cirque du Soleil (French for "Circus of the Sun"), the Canadian circus that has become famous for 1 it's spectacular sets and amazing acrobats. While it may be unusual, Laliberté's career choice was hardly 2 surprising when he was a child, his parents took him to watch the Ringling Brothers and Barnum \& Bailey Circus, an experience that led him to read the biography of its creator, P. T. Barnum.

While still in his teens, Laliberté produced several performing arts events. After leaving college, he entered the world of street 3 performance, and he would play the harmonica and accordion on the streets of Quebec. He then 4 got together with a troupe that included firebreathers, jugglers, and acrobats who traveled around the country from show to show. Later, he returned to Quebec, where he found a steady job at a hydroelectric dam. Soon after his employment began, 5 however, the dam's employees went on strike. Laliberté took the opportunity to return to his life as a street performer.
