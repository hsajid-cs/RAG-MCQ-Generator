3. A glacier's life is defined by movement and change. Glacier movement most often occurs over hundreds or even thousands of years, but not all glaciers move slowly. For example, surging glaciers can flow quickly, sometimes traveling as much as 10 to 100 times faster than regular glaciers. Others may retreat within only a few decades, leaving once glaciated valleys blooming with vegetation.

Glaciers helped shape the Cascade mountains, but some reports now suggest that those glaciers could be gone within a matter of decades. 3 The number of stationary glaciers decreased from 1995 and 2013, and some glaciers have disappeared entirely. Scientists warn that the melting ice could impact everything from tourism to agriculture, forestry, water quality, and underwater ecosystems.

4. A few decades ago, wild giant pandas were considered a symbol of wildlife conservation. Largescale infrastructure projects were destroying the animals' traditional habitat, found only in the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Now, however, conservationists' efforts seem to be paying off. According to one recent survey, the panda population began to increase during the decade beginning in 2003, 4 rising by several hundred to over 2,000 in 2013. The World Wildlife Federation's 2015-2025 giant-panda conservation strategy will set the course for panda-protection efforts over the next decade, with a focus on improving panda habitats in a manner that balances conservation and sustainable local development.

Which choice offers an accurate interpretation of data presented in the chart?
A) NO CHANGE
B) rising by several hundred in each year, for a total of over 1,800
C) declining slightly before rebounding to over 1,800
D) experiencing an initial drop but eventually climbing to 2,000

5. The process of getting energy from the wind into a home or business is complex and involves many components. A modern wind turbine consists of an estimated 8.000 parts and can be up to 300 feet high. Turbines must be designed, built, transported, and erected before they can start producing energy. This process can be split into three major phases: manufacturing, project development, and operation and maintenance. In a successful project, these phases overlap, and there is substantial communication among workers in all three phases. Currently, 5 wind-power jobs are evenly distributed between the financial services, construction, and transport sectors. However, as new wind farms are built, existing ones are upgraded, and manufacturers are able to take advantage of returns to scale, other sectors also are expected to experience rapid growth.
Which choice offers an accurate interpretation of data presented in the chart?
A) NO CHANGE
B) only half as many people are employed in construction jobs as are employed in manufacturing jobs.
C) there are twice as many jobs in the financial services sector as there are in the transport sector.
D) the highest number of wind-power jobs are concentrated in the manufacturing and "other jobs" sectors.

# Shorter is Better

One of the most important concepts that the SAT tests is conciseness: as a general rule, short, clear constructions are preferable to long, wordy ones. To be clear, this concept does not apply to questions testing specific grammatical concepts, e.g., subject-verb agreement. However, when multiple answers are grammatically acceptable and convey the same information, the shortest one will typically be correct.

When you do not know the answer to a question immediately and are unsure of how to figure it out, you should start by checking the shortest answer and work back to the longest one in order of length. That also means that when there is a DELETE option, you should always check it first.
