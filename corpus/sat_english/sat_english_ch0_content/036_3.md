3. Above a hole in the ice, a polar bear lies waiting for a seal to emerge. Food in the frozen Arctic is
1 scarce, in short supply, so the shaggy white hunter must seize every opportunity to pursue its prey. The polar bear is one of the world's largest 2 carnivores that eats meat, rivaled only by the Kodiak brown bear of southern Alaska. Numerous adaptations make the polar bear uniquely suited to life 3 in and around icy habitats. A thick layer of blubber beneath its fur provides
