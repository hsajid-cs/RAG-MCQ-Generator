A) NO CHANGE
B) artists works
C) artist's work's
D) artists' works

Artists is followed by another noun, works. An apostrophe is therefore required. Eliminate B).
Works is followed by and, which is not a noun. A noun can only possess another noun, so no apostrophe should be used. Eliminate C).

Now, the question is whether the apostrophe should be placed before or after the $-s$ in artists. In other words, is the noun singular (before) or plural (after)? In this case, the word hundreds indicates that the noun is plural. The apostrophe must therefore be placed after the $-s$, making D) correct.

# Plural and Possessive Pronouns

To review: a pronoun is a word such as it or their that can replace a noun in a sentence. For example, the sentence I.M. Pei is a well-known architect can be rewritten as He is a well-known architect.

Apostrophes are used differently for pronouns than they are for nouns.

- To form the possessive of a pronoun, add $-s$. Do not add an apostrophe.
- To form a contraction with the verb is or are, add apostrophe $+-s$ or $-r e$.
