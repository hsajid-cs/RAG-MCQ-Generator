4. The northern snakehead is a fish that lives up to its 1 name: its head tapers to a point, making it look as if 2 someone, perhaps a mad scientist - had grafted a snake's head and several inches of scaly body onto a fish.

Given the fish's wild appearance, it's hardly a surprise that scientists have given it a 3 nickname - Frankenfish.

Colorful three-dimensional stone wall murals. One such mural was produced by Janna Morrison in 2005. She combined the piecework of mosaic murals with traditional soapstone slab carving 3 to produce: lifelike tropical plants, flowers, and sea life scenes ranging in size from a few inches to life-size plants inlaid along entire walls.
