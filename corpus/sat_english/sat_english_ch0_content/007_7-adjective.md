# Preliminary Exercise: Identifying Parts of Speech (answers p. 239)

Directions: identify and write the part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adverb) for each underlined word.

Although igloos are usually associated with
Alaskan Eskimos (Inuits), 1 they have mostly been
constructed by people who lived in the central
Arctic and Greenland's Thule region. Other Inuit
Peoples 2 tended to use snow to insulate their
houses, which were constructed 3 from whalebone
and hides.

Traditionally, three types of igloos 4 were
constructed. Small igloos were constructed as
temporary shelters 5 and used only for one or two
nights. These were built and 6 used during hunting
trips, often on open sea ice. Medium-sized igloos
were usually single-room family dwellings 7 that
housed one or two families. Often, several of these
igloos 8 were located in a small area, forming an
Inuit village. The largest igloos were normally built in
pairs: 9 one of the structures was a temporary
structure for community feasts and dances, while
the other was 10 intended for living. These igloos
could be constructed from several smaller igloos
attached 11 by tunnels.

Today, igloos are used mostly for brief camping trips; 12 however, the principles behind their construction 13 remain the same. The snow used to build an igloo must have enough strength to be cut and stacked correctly. The best snow to use for this 14 purpose is snow blown by wind because 15 it contains interlocking ice crystals, which increase the amount 16 of weight the ice can support.

Because of snow's excellent 17 insulation properties, inhabited igloos are surprisingly comfortable and warm inside. Sometimes, a short tunnel is constructed at the entrance 18 to reduce heat loss when the door 19 is opened. Animal skins can also be used as door flaps to keep warm air in.

Architecturally, the igloo is unique 20 because it is a dome that can be constructed without an 21 additional supporting structure. Independent blocks of ice lean on one another and are polished to fit. 22 In the traditional Inuit igloo, the 23 heat from the kudlik, or stone lamp, causes the interior to melt slightly, creating a layer of ice that 24 contributes to the igloo's strength. In fact, a correctly-built igloo will support the weight of a person standing 25 on the roof.
