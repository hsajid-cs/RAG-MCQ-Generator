To be and to have are two of the most common verbs in the English language. Because they are irregular, it is important that you be able to recognize their singular and plural forms.

|  | To be | To have |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Present: singular | is | has |
| plural | are | have |
|  |  |  |
| Past: singular | was | had |
| plural | were | had |

Unfortunately, questions testing subject-verb agreement are unlikely to make disagreements too obvious. To reiterate, subjects and verbs are unlikely to appear next to one another. There are, however, a number of fairly predictable ways in which disagreements can be disguised.

# A. Subject - Non-Essential Clause - Verb

In this structure, a non-essential clause is simply inserted between the subject and the verb to distract from the fact that the subject is singular and the verb is plural or vice-versa. When the information between the commas is crossed out, the disagreement between is revealed.

For example:
Incorrect: Green tea with mint, which is a popular drink in many Middle Eastern countries, are said to have many health benefits.

Cross out: Green tea with mint, which is a popular drink in many Middle Eastern countries, are said to have many health benefits.

Correct: Green tea with mint, which is a popular drink in many Middle Eastern countries, is said to have many health benefits.

It is important that you pick up your pencil and physically draw a line through the non-essential clause. Do not simply draw a line in your imagination. Sooner or later, your eye will most likely look past an error that you could have easily caught, and you will lose points unnecessarily.

Occasionally, a disagreement may also occur within a non-essential clause:
Incorrect: Green tea with mint, which are a popular drink in many Middle Eastern countries, is said to have many health benefits.

Correct: Green tea with mint, which is a popular drink in many Middle Eastern countries, is said to have many health benefits.
