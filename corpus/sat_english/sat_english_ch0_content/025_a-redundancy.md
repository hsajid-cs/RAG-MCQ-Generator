## A. Redundancy

Never use two synonyms to describe something when you can use only one word.

The increasingly global character of publishing has caused editors to be I simultaneously pulled in many directions at the same time, with authors in multiple countries often making competing demands.

I
A) NO CHANGE
B) simultaneously pulled in many directions at a single time,
C) simultaneously pulled in many directions at once.
D) simultaneously pulled in many directions,

When you look at the answers, you can immediately notice that D) is shorter than the others. Simultaneously and at the same time are synonyms, so only one of these words/phrase should be used. D) is thus correct.

Note that in some cases, you must look at the non-underlined portion in order to identify the redundancy.

The increasingly global character of publishing has caused editors to be simultaneously pulled in many directions I at the same time, with authors in multiple countries often making competing demands.

I
A) NO CHANGE
B) at a single time
C) at once
D) DELETE the underlined portion

The presence of a DELETE option suggests that D) should be checked first. And indeed, if you look back at the full sentence, you'll find the redundancy. D) is again correct. Notice that in this case, the error is hidden much more effectively.

# B. Wordiness

Some answer choices add in extra words for no reason other than to make those answers longer. Do not get tempted simply because you like how they sound!

For example:

During the Nimrod Expedition to the South Pole, Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton led a group of explorers on
