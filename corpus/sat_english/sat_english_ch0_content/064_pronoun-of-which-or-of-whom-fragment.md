## Pronoun + "of which" or "of whom" = fragment

When an indefinite pronoun is followed by of which or of whom, it creates a dependent clause, which by definition cannot stand alone as a full sentence.

Fragment: Many of which are grown in greenhouses around the world
Fragment: Most of whom believe that the tomato is a vegetable
Which means:
Incorrect: The tomato is used by cooks around the world, most of them believe that it is a vegetable rather than a fruit.

# D. Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs and clauses. Most adverbs are created by adding $-l y$ onto adjectives.

| Slow | $\rightarrow$ | Slowly |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Current | $\rightarrow$ | Currently |
| Important | $\rightarrow$ | Importantly |

A second type of adverb, however, does not end in $-l y$. Some of these adverbs are adverbs of time, which tell you when or how often something occurs. Others are transitions that indicate relationships between ideas.

| Again | Meanwhile | Next | Often | Then |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Consequently | Moreover | Never | Still | Today |
| Furthermore | Nevertheless | Now | Sometimes | Yesterday |

Important: Adverbs have no grammatical effect whatsoever on a sentence. A sentence to which an adverb is added will continue to be a sentence, regardless of where the adverb is placed.

Sentence: Now, the tomato grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

Sentence: The tomato currently grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world.

Sentence: The tomato grows in many shapes and varieties in greenhouses around the world today.
