1. Exploration and discovery have been a part of American history since the fifteenth century, and no expedition was as influential in shaping the United States
1 as Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. In 1803, they set out to find an all-water route to the Pacific Ocean. The purchase of the Louisiana Territory that year had opened vast lands for settlement. Under orders from President Thomas Jefferson, Lewis, Clark and their group of woodsmen, hunters, and translators not only blazed a trail into the wilderness 2 and they spent three years making their way across the continent.
2. Meteoroids are the smallest members of the solar system, ranging from large chunks of rock and metal to minuscule fragments no larger 1 then a grain of sand. Whenever a meteoroid plows into the Earth's atmosphere, it creates a meteor: a very brief flash of light in the sky. Millions of meteors occur in the Earth's atmosphere daily. Just as many meteoroids appear in the atmosphere during daylight 2 as appear at night; however, meteors are usually observed after dark, when faint objects can more easily be identified. The light produced by a meteor may come in a variety of shades, depending on the chemical composition of the meteoroid and the speed of its movement through the atmosphere.
