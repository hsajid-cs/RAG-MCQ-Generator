### 4.2.1 Addition of Matrices

Two matrices are conformable for addition if they are of the same order.
The sum $A+B$ of two $m \times n$, matrices $A=\left[a_{i j}\right]$ and $B=\left[b_{i j}\right]$ is the $m \times n$ matrix $C=\left[c_{i j}\right]$ formed by adding the corresponding entries of $A$ and $B$ together. In symbols, we write as $C=A+B$, that is:

$$
\left[c_{i j}\right]=\left[a_{i j}+b_{i j}\right] \text { where } c_{i j}=a_{i j}+b_{i j} \text { for } i=1,2,3, \ldots, m ; j=1,2,3, \ldots, n
