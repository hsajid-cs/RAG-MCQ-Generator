### 6.5.2 Properties of G.P.

(i) If each term of a G.P. is multiplied or divided by the same non-zero number, then the resulting sequence is also a G.P. that is if $g_{1}, g_{2}, g_{3}, \ldots, g_{n}, \ldots$ are in G.P. and $k$ is a non-zero number, then
(a) $k g_{1}, k g_{2}, k g_{3}, \ldots, k g_{n}, \ldots$ are also in G.P.
(b) $\frac{g_{1}}{k}, \frac{g_{2}}{k}, \frac{g_{3}}{k}, \ldots, \frac{g_{n}}{k}, \ldots$ are also in G.P.
(ii) The reciprocals of the term of a G.P. also form a G.P. that is if $a, b, c$ are in G.P., then $\frac{1}{a}, \frac{1}{b}, \frac{1}{c}$ are also in G.P.

(iii) If each term of a G.P. is raised to the same power, the resulting numbers also form a G.P. that is, if $a, b, c$ are in G.P., then $a^{n}, b^{n}, c^{n}$ are also in G.P.
(iv) Three numbers $a, b, c$ are in G.P. if and only if $b^{2}=a c$.
(v) If the set of positive numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots, a_{n}, \ldots$ are in G.P., then $\log a_{1}, \log a_{2}$, $\log a_{3}, \ldots, \log a_{n}, \ldots$ are in A.P. and vice-versa.
(vi) Term by term multiplication or division of two G.Ps. are again in G.P. i.e., if $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3} \ldots, a_{n}$, and $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, \ldots, b_{n}$, are in G.P. then $a_{1} b_{1}, a_{2} b_{2}, a_{3} b_{3}, \ldots$, $a_{n} b_{n}$ and $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}, \frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}, \frac{a_{3}}{b_{3}}, \ldots, \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$ are also in G.P.
Example 12 Find the eighth term of a geometric sequence for which $a_{1}=-3$ and $r=-2$.
Solution Here, $a_{1}=-3, r=-2, n=8$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a_{n}=a_{1} \cdot r^{n-1} \\
& a_{8}=(-3) \cdot(-2)^{8-1} \\
& a_{8}=(-3) \cdot(-128) \\
& a_{8}=384
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 13 Find the $n^{\text {th }}$ term of the G.P., 3, 12, 48, ...
Solution Here $a_{1}=3, r=4$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a_{n}=a_{1} \cdot r^{n-1} \\
& a_{n}=3 \cdot 4^{n-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 14 Find the tenth term of the G.P., for which $a_{4}=108$ and $r=3$.
Solution Step - 1: Find $a_{1}$.
Here, $n=4, r=3, a_{4}=108$

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{n} & =a_{1} \cdot r^{n-1} \\
a_{4} & =a_{1} \cdot 3^{4-1} \\
108 & =27 a_{1} \\
4 & =a_{1} \\
a_{1} & =4
\end{aligned}
$$

Step - 2: Find $a_{10}$.
Here, $n=10, a_{1}=4, r=3$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a_{n}=a_{1} \cdot r^{n-1} \\
& a_{10}=4 \cdot 3^{10-1} \\
& a_{10}=78,732
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 15 Find the $5^{\text {th }}$ term of the G.P., 3, 6, 12, ....
Solution Here $a_{1}=3, a_{2}=6$, therefore, $r=\frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}=\frac{6}{3}=2$.

Using $a_{n}=a_{1} r^{n-1}$ for $n=5$, we have

$$
a_{5}=a_{1} r^{5-1}=3 \cdot 2^{5-1}=3 \cdot 2^{4}=48
$$

Example16 Find $a_{n}$ if $a_{6}=\frac{8}{27}$ and $a_{7}=\frac{-64}{729}$ of a G.P.
Solution: To find $a_{n}$ we have to find $a_{1}$ and $r$.

Using $\quad a_{n}=a_{1} r^{n-1}$

$$
a_{4}=a_{1} r^{4-1}=a_{1} r^{3}, \text { so } a_{1} r^{3}=\frac{8}{27}
$$

and $\quad a_{7}=a_{1} r^{7-1}=a_{1} r^{6}$, so $a_{1} r^{6}=\frac{-64}{729}$
Thus, $\quad \frac{a_{1} r^{6}}{a_{1} r^{3}}=\frac{\frac{-64}{729}}{\frac{8}{27}}=\frac{-8}{27} \quad$ or $\quad r^{3}=\left(\frac{-2}{3}\right)^{3}$
$\Rightarrow \quad r=-\frac{2}{3}$
(taking only real value of $r$ )
Put $r^{3}=-\frac{8}{27}$ in (ii), to obtain $a_{1}$ that is,

$$
a_{1}\left(-\frac{8}{27}\right)=\frac{8}{27} \Rightarrow a_{1}=-1
$$

Now putting $a_{1}=-1$ and $r=\frac{-2}{3}$ in (i), we get

$$
a_{4}=(-1)\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-1}=(-1)(-1)^{n-1} \cdot\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-1}=(-1)^{n}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-1}
$$

# 6.6 Geometric Mean (G.M.)

A number $G$ is said to be a geometric mean (G.M.) between two numbers $a$ and $b$ if $a$, $G, b$ are in G.P. Therefore

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{G}{a}=\frac{b}{G} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad G^{2}=a b \\
& \Rightarrow \quad G= \pm \sqrt{a b}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note $G_{1}, G_{2}, G_{3}, \ldots, G_{a}$ are said to be $n$ G.Ms. between two numbers $a$ and $b$ if $a$, $G_{1}, G_{2}, G_{3}, \ldots, G_{a}, b$ are in G.P.

Example 17 Insert three G.Ms. between 2 and $\frac{1}{2}$.
Solution Let $G_{1}, G_{2}, G_{3}$ be three G.Ms. between 2 and $\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore

$2, G_{1}, G_{2}, G_{3}, \frac{1}{2}$ are in G.P. Here $a_{1}=2, a_{2}=\frac{1}{2}$ and $n=5$.
Using $a_{n}=a_{1} r^{n-1}$ we have

$$
a_{2}=a_{1} r^{2-1} \text { that is, } a_{2}=a_{1} r^{4}
$$

Now substituting the values of $a_{2}$ and $a_{1}$ in (i) we have

$$
\frac{1}{2}=2 r^{4} \quad \text { or } \quad r^{4}=\frac{1}{4}
$$

Taking square root of (ii), we get

$$
r^{2}= \pm \frac{1}{2}
$$

We have, $r^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \quad$ or $\quad r^{2}=-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{i^{2}}{2}\left(\because-1=i^{1}\right)$
$\Rightarrow \quad r= \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \quad$ or $\quad r= \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} i$
When $\quad r=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, then $G_{1}=2\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)=\sqrt{2}, G_{2}=2\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}=1, \quad G_{3}=2\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$
When $\quad r=\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}$, then $G_{1}=2\left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)=-\sqrt{2}, G_{2}=2\left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}=1, \quad G_{3}=2\left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$
When $\quad r=\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}$, then $G_{1}=2\left(\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\right)=\sqrt{2} i, G_{2}=2\left(\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}=-1, G_{3}=2\left(\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}=-\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}$
When $\quad r=\frac{-i}{\sqrt{2}}$, then $G_{1}=2\left(\frac{-i}{\sqrt{2}}\right)=-\sqrt{2} i, G_{2}=2\left(\frac{-i}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}=-1, G_{3}=2\left(\frac{-i}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}=\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}$
Note The real values of $r$ are usually taken but here other cases are considered to widen the outlook of the students.

# 6.7 Geometric Series

Suppose you e-mail an Islamic quote to three friends on Monday. Each of those friends send it to three of their friends on Tuesday. Each person who receives the quote on Tuesday sends it to three more people on Wednesday and so on.
Notice that every day, the number of people who read your Islamic quote is three times the number that read it the day before. By Sunday, the number of people, including yourself, who have read the quote is $1+3+9+27+81+243+729+2187$ or 3280 . The numbers $1,3,9,27,81,243,729$ and 2187 form a geometric sequence in which $a_{1}=1$ and $r=3$. The indicated sum of the numbers in the sequence, $1+3+9+27+$ $81+243+729+2187$ is called a geometric series.

The sum of a geometric progression can be written as: $S_{n}=\frac{a_{1}\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}, r \neq 1$
To develop a formula for the sum of a geometric series, consider

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S_{n}=a_{1}+a_{1} r+a_{1} r^{2}+\cdots+a_{1} r^{n-3}+a_{1} r^{n-2}+a_{1} r^{n-1} \\
& r S_{n}=a_{1} r+a_{1} r^{2}+\cdots+a_{1} r^{n-3}+a_{1} r^{n-2}+a_{1} r^{n-1}+a_{1} r^{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

Subtracting (ii) from (i), we get

$$
S_{n}-r S_{n}=a_{1}-a_{1} r^{n}
$$

Note
If $r=1$, then $S_{n}=n a$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{n}(1-r) & =a_{1}\left(1-r^{n}\right) \\
S_{n} & =\frac{a_{1}\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}, r \neq 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 18 Find the sum of $n$ terms of the geometric series if $a_{n}=(-3)\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{n}$.
Solution We can write $(-3)\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{n}$ as:

$$
-3\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{n-1}=\left(-\frac{6}{5}\right)\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{n-1}, \text { that is } a_{n}=\left(-\frac{6}{5}\right)\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{n-1}
$$

comparing $\left(-\frac{6}{5}\right)\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{n-1}$ with $a_{1} r^{n-1}$, we have $a_{1}=-\frac{6}{5}$ and $r=\frac{2}{5}$
Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{n} & =\frac{a_{1}\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}=\frac{-\frac{6}{5}\left[1-\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{n}\right]}{1-\frac{2}{5}} \\
& =\left(-\frac{6}{5}\right)\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)\left[1-\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{n}\right]=(-2)\left[1-\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{n}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

# 6.8 Arithmetico-Geometric Progression (A.G.P.)

Suppose $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots, a_{n}, \ldots$ is an A.P., and $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, \ldots, b_{n}, \ldots$ is a G.P. then the sequence formed by multiplying the corresponding terms of A.P. and G.P., that is, $a_{1} b_{1}$, $a_{2} b_{2}, a_{3} b_{3}, \ldots, a_{n} b_{n}, \ldots$ is said to be an arithmetico-geometric sequence.
Consider an A.P., $a, a+d, a+2 d, \ldots,\{a+(n-1) d\}$ and a G.P., $b, b r, b r^{2}, \ldots, b r^{n-1}$ where $r \neq 1$.
Multiplying the corresponding terms of A.P. and G.P., we get an arithmeticogeometric sequence

$$
a b,(a+d) b r,(a+2 d) b r^{2}, \ldots,\{a+(n-1) d\} b r^{n-1}
$$

Note that the $n^{\text {th }}$ term of arithmetico-geometric sequence is product of $n^{\text {th }}$ term of A.P. and $n^{\text {th }}$ term of G.P.
