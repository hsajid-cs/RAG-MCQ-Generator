### 6.1.1 Finite and Infinite Sequences

1. A sequence which consists of a finite number of terms is called a finite sequence. For example, $2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23$ is a finite sequence of 8 terms.
2. A sequence which consists of an infinite number of terms is called an infinite sequence. For example, $3,10,17,24, \ldots$ is an infinite sequence, or more generally as $3,10,17,24, \ldots, 7 n-4, \ldots$ to show how each term was generated.

Note If a sequence is given, then we can find its $n^{\text {th }}$ term and if the $n^{\text {th }}$ term of a sequence is given then we can find the terms of the sequence.
Example 1 Find the first four terms of the following sequences whose $n^{\text {th }}$ terms are given:
(i) $a_{n}=3 n+1$
(ii) $a_{n}=3 n^{2}-3$

Solution (i) $a_{n}=3 n+1$
Substituting $n=1,2,3$ and 4 we have

$$
a_{1}=3(1)+1=3+1=4
$$

Similarly, $\quad a_{2}=3(2)+1=6+1=7$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a_{3}=3(3)+1=9+1=10 \\
& a_{4}=3(4)+1=12+1=13
\end{aligned}
$$

The first four terms of the sequence are $4,7,10,13$.
(ii) $a_{n}=3 n^{2}-3$

Substituting $n=1,2,3$ and 4 we have

$$
a_{1}=3(1)^{2}-3=0
$$

Similarly, $\quad a_{2}=3(2)^{2}-3=3(4)-3=12-3=9$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a_{3}=3(3)^{2}-3=3(9)-3=27-3=24 \\
& a_{4}=3(4)^{2}-3=3(16)-3=48-3=45
\end{aligned}
$$

The first four terms of the sequence are $0,9,24,45$.
Sequences of numbers are also called progressions. Depending on the pattern, the progressions are classified as follows:
(i) Arithmetic progression
(ii) Geometric progression
(iii) Harmonic progression

(iv) $a_{1}=-1, a_{n+1}=\frac{3}{a_{n}+2}$
(v) $a_{n}=8-\frac{20}{3+n}$
(vi) $a_{1}=1, a_{n+1}=\left(3 a_{n}+2\right)^{2}$
(vii) $a_{n}=(-2 n)^{2}$
(viii) $a_{n}=(-1)^{n} 7 n^{2}$

(iv) $x, 2 x^{2}, 3 x^{3}, \ldots$
(v) $a_{1}, a_{1}+d, a_{1}+2 d, \ldots$
(vi) $a_{1}, a_{1} r, a_{1} r^{2}, \ldots$
(vii) $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}+c_{1}}, \frac{2 a_{2}}{b_{2}+c_{2}}, \frac{3 a_{3}}{b_{3}+c_{3}}, \ldots$
(viii) $\frac{1}{a_{1}}, \frac{1}{a_{1}+d}, \frac{1}{a_{1}+2 d}, \ldots$

# 6.2 Arithmetic Progression or Arithmetic Sequence (A.P.)

A sequence $\left\{a_{n}\right\}$ is called an arithmetic sequence or arithmetic progression (A.P.), if $a_{n}-a_{n-1}$ is the same number for all $n \in N$ and $n>1$. The difference $a_{n}-a_{n-1}(n>1)$ i.e., the difference of two consecutive terms of an A.P., is called the common difference and is usually denoted by $d$.
Thus, an arithmetic progression is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained by adding fixed constant to the previous term. This fixed constant is called common difference of the arithmetic progression.
For example: Following sequences are in A.P.
(i) $1,3,5,7, \ldots$ (common difference is 2 )
(ii) $54,51,48, \ldots$ (common difference is -3 )

An arithmetic progression with $n$ terms can be written as:

$$
a_{1}, a_{1}+d, a_{1}+2 d, \ldots, a_{1}+(n-1) d
$$

The $n^{\text {th }}$ term of an arithmetic progression can be written as:

$$
a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1) d
$$

## Note

(i) $1^{n}, 2^{\text {nd }}, 3^{\text {rd }}$ and $n^{\text {th }}$ terms of an A.P. are denoted by $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}$ and $a_{n}$ respectively.
(ii) $n^{\text {th }}$ term from the end of an $A . P$. is $(m-n+1)^{\text {th }}$ term where ' $m$ ' denotes the total number of terms of an A.P.
(iii) Three numbers $a, b, c$ are in $A . P$. if and only if $2 b=a+c$.
(iv) Any term (except first and last) in an A.P. is equal to half of the sum of two terms equidistant from it.
(v) If the term $a_{1}$ is unknown or not given, the $n^{\text {th }}$ term can be written as $a_{n}=a_{m}+(n-m) d, n \geq m$. Note that the subscript of the given term and coefficient of $d$ sum to $n$.
The middle term of an A.P. depends upon the number of terms, for example
(i) $1,3,5,7,9,11$ is an A.P. with $n=6$
(ii) $1,3,5,7,9,11,13$ is an A.P. with $n=7$

i.e., If the total number of terms of an A.P. is even, then there are two middle terms i.e., $\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^{n}$ and $\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)^{n}$ where $n$ represent the number of terms. In example (i) 5,7 are two middle terms.
If the total number of terms of an A.P. is odd, then there is only one middle term i.e., $\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)^{n}$ term. In example (ii) 7 is the only middle term.

# 6.2.1 Selection of terms in A.P.

(i) Three consecutive terms of an A.P. can be chosen as $a-d, a, a+d$ or $a, a+d$, or $a+2 d$
(ii) Four consecutive term of an A.P. may be written like $a-3 d, a-d, a+d, a+3 d$ or $a, a+d, a+2 d, a+3 d$.
(iii) Last four consecutive terms if $\ell$ is the last term can be written as below:

$$
\ell-3 d, \ell-2 d, \ell-d, \ell
$$

If each term of an A.P. is increased or decreased, multiplied or divided by same non-zero number, then the resulting sequence is also an A.P. that is, if $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots, a_{n}, \ldots$ are in A.P. with common difference $d$ then
(i) $a_{1} \pm k, a_{2} \pm k, \ldots, a_{n} \pm k, \ldots$ are also in A.P. with common difference ' $d$ '.
(ii) $k a_{1}, k a_{2}, \ldots, k a_{n}, \ldots$ are also in A.P. with common difference ' $k d$ '.
(iii) $\frac{a_{1}}{k}, \frac{a_{2}}{k}, \ldots, \frac{a_{n}}{k}, \ldots$ are also in A.P. with common difference $\frac{d}{k}$.
(iv) Term by term addition or subtraction of two A.Ps. is also an A.P. i.e., If $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots a_{n}, \ldots$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, \ldots b_{n}, \ldots$ are in A.P., then $a_{1} \pm b_{1}, a_{2} \pm b_{2}$, $a_{2} \pm b_{3}, \ldots$ are also in A.P.
Example 2 Find the general term and the eleventh term of the A.P. whose first term and the common difference are 2 and -3 respectively. Also write its first four terms.
Solution
Here, $a_{1}=2, d=-3$
We know that $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1) d$
So,

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{n} & =2+(n-1)(-3)=2-3 n+3 \\
a_{n} & =5-3 n
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the general term of the A.P. is $5-3 n$

Putting $n=11$ in (i), we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{11} & =5-3(11) \\
& =5-33=-28
\end{aligned}
$$

We can find $a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$ by putting $n=2,3,4$ in (i), that is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a_{2}=5-3(2)=-1 \\
& a_{3}=5-3(3)=-4 \\
& a_{4}=5-3(4)=-7
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, the first four terms of the sequence are: $2,-1,-4,-7$.
Example 3 If the $5^{\text {th }}$ term of an $A . P$. is 13 and $17^{\text {th }}$ term is 49 , find $a_{n}$ and $a_{13}$.
Solution Given that $a_{5}=13$ and $a_{17}=49$
Putting $n=5$ in $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1) d$, we have $a_{5}=a_{1}+(5-1) d$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a_{5}=a_{1}+4 d \\
& 13=a_{1}+4 d \quad\left(\because a_{5}=13\right) \\
& \text { Also } \quad a_{17}=a_{1}+(17-1) d \\
& 49=a_{1}+16 d \quad\left(\because a_{1}+49\right) \\
& 49=\left(a_{1}+4 d\right)+12 d \\
& 49=13+12 d \quad \text { by (i) } \\
& \Rightarrow \quad 12 d=36 \Rightarrow d=3 \\
& \text { From (i), } a_{1}=13-4 d=13-4(3)=13-12=1 \\
& \text { Thus } \quad a_{n}=1+(n-1)(3)=3 n-2 \text { and } \\
& a_{13}=3(13)-2=39-2=37
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 4 Find the number of terms in the A.P. ; if $a_{1}=3, d=7$ and $a_{n}=59$
Solution Using $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1) d$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 59=3+(n-1) \times 7 \quad\left(\because a_{n}=59, a_{1}=3 \text { and } d=7\right) \\
& 56=(n-1) \times 7 \Rightarrow n-1=8 \Rightarrow n=9
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the terms in the A.P. are 9.
Example 5 If $a_{n-2}=3 n-11$ find the $n^{\text {th }}$ term of the sequence.
Solution Replacing $n$ by $n+2$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{n+2-2} & =3(n+2)-11 \\
a_{n} & =3 n+6-11 \\
a_{n} & =3 n-5
\end{aligned}
$$

# 6.3 Arithmetic Mean (A.M.)

A number $A$ is said to be the A.M. between the two numbers $a$ and $b$ if $a, A, b$ are in A.P. If $d$ is the common difference of this A.P., then $A-a=d$ and $b-A=d$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Thus } A-a=b-A \\
& \text { or } \quad 2 A=a+b \\
& \Rightarrow \quad A=\frac{a+b}{2}
\end{aligned} \quad \text { Note if } A_{1} A_{2}, A_{3}, \ldots, A_{n} \text { are said to be } n \text { A.Ms. between two numbers } a \text { and } b \text {, then } \\
& a_{1} A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, \ldots, A_{n}, b \text { are in A.P. }
$$

Example 6 Find three A.Ms. between $\sqrt{2}$ and $3 \sqrt{2}$.
Solution Let $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}$ be three A.Ms. between $\sqrt{2}$ and $3 \sqrt{2}$. Then,

$$
\sqrt{2}, A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, 3 \sqrt{2} \text { are in } A . P
$$

Here $a_{1}=\sqrt{2}, n=5, a_{2}=3 \sqrt{2}$ using $a_{2}=a_{1}+(5-1) d$, we have $3 \sqrt{2}=\sqrt{2}+4 d$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad d=\frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{4}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
& \text { Now } \quad A_{1}=a_{1}+d=\sqrt{2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{2+1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \\
& A_{2}=A_{1}+d=\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}=2 \sqrt{2} \\
& A_{3}=A_{2}+d=2 \sqrt{2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{4+1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{5}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, $\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}, 2 \sqrt{2}, \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}}$ are the three A.Ms. between $\sqrt{2}$ and $3 \sqrt{2}$.
