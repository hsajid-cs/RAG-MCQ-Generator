### 1.4.1 Properties of Cube Roots of Unity

(i) Each complex cube root of unity is square of the other

$$
\text { If } \frac{-1+\sqrt{3} i}{2}=\omega \text {, then } \frac{-1-\sqrt{3} i}{2}=\omega^{2}
$$

and if $\frac{-1-\sqrt{3} i}{2}=\omega$, then $\frac{-1+\sqrt{3} i}{2}=\omega^{2}[\omega$ is read as omega]
(ii) The sum of all the three cube roots of unity is zero i.e., $1+\omega+\omega^{2}=0$
(iii) The product of all the three cube roots of unity is unity i.e., $1 \cdot \omega \cdot \omega^{2}=\omega^{2}=1$, as a consequence of which, each imaginary cube root of unity is the reciprocal of the other, that is, $\omega=\frac{1}{\omega^{2}}, \omega^{2}=\frac{1}{\omega}$.
