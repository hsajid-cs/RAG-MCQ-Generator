### 1.4.2 Four Fourth Roots of Unity

Let $x$ be a fourth root of unity

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad x=(1)^{\frac{1}{4}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^{4}=1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^{4}-1=0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad\left(x^{2}-1\right)\left(x^{2}+1\right)=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-1=0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^{2}=1 \Rightarrow x= \pm 1 \\
& \text { and } x^{2}+1=0 \Rightarrow x^{2}=-1 \Rightarrow x= \pm i \text {. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence four fourth roots of unity are: $1,-1, i,-i$.

# 1.4.3 Properties of four Fourth Roots of Unity

We have found that the four fourth roots of unity are: $1,-1,+i,-i$
(i) Sum of all the four fourth roots of unity is zero

$$
\because \quad 1+(-1)+i+(-i)=0
$$

(ii) The real fourth roots of unity are additive inverses of each other. 1 and -1 are the real fourth roots of unity and $1+(-1)=0=(-1)+1$
(iii) Both the imaginary fourth roots of unity are conjugate of each other. $i$ and $-i$ are imaginary fourth roots of unity, which are obviously conjugates of each other.
(iv) Product of all the fourth roots of unity is -1 i.e., $1 \times(-1) \times i \times(-i)=-1$

Example 11 Prove that: $\left(x^{3}+y^{3}\right)=(x+y)(x+\omega y)\left(x+\omega^{2} y\right)$
Proof: R.H.S $=(x+y)(x+\omega y)\left(x+\omega^{2} y\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(x+y)\left[x^{2}+\left(\omega+\omega^{2}\right) y x+\omega^{2} y^{2}\right] \\
& =(x+y)\left(x^{2}-x y+y^{2}\right)=x^{3}+y^{3}=\text { L.H.S. }\left\{\because \omega^{3}=1, \omega+\omega^{2}=-1\right\}
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence proved.

# 1.4 Polar Coordinates System

Polar coordinates are often more convenient than Cartesian coordinates in situations involving circular or rotational symmetry, or when a problem depends on distance from a fixed point and angle relative to a reference direction. Just as the Cartesian coordinate system uses an ordered pair $(x, y)$ to describe the position of a point, the polar coordinate system determines the position of a point using a directed distance $r$ from a fixed origin $O$ (called the pole) and an angle $\theta$ that the line connecting the origin to the point makes with the polar axis (typically aligned
with the positive $x$-axis).

In polar coordinate system the location of a point $P$ can be described by polar coordinates in the form $(r, \theta)$, where $r$ and $\theta$ are real numbers.
While $r$ is typically considered non-negative ( $r \geq 0$ ), it is also possible for $r$ to be negative $(r<0)$. The value of $r$ changes depending on its sign, and this affects the position of the point in the plane.
When $r>0$, the angle $\theta$ is the measure of any angle in standard position whose terminal side lies along the line connecting the origin to the point $P$, measured from the polar axis (positive $x$-axis).
For example, the polar coordinates $\left(5, \frac{\pi}{4}\right)$ represent a point 5 units away from pole at an angle of $\frac{\pi}{4}$ radians.
When $r<0$, the angle $\theta$ is the measure of any angle in standard position whose terminal side lies along the line connecting the origin to the point $Q$, but the point $Q$ is located $|r|$ units in the opposite direction (i.e., $\theta+\pi$ ) from the polar axis (positive $x$-axis). For example, the polar coordinates $\left(-5, \frac{\pi}{4}\right)$ represents a point 5 units away from the pole, but in the direction of $\frac{\pi}{4}+\pi=\frac{5 \pi}{4}$ radians.

# Note $(-5, \pi / 4)$ and $(5,5 \pi / 4)$ represent the same point in the plane
