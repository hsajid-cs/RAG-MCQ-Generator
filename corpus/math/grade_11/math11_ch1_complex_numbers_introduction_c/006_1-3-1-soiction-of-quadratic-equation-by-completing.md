### 1.3.1 Soiction of Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square

As we learned in previous classes, completing the square is a powerful and systematic method for solving quadratic equations. This technique involves rewriting a quadratic equation in the form $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$ into a perfect square trinomial, which can then be solved by taking the square root of both sides. This method is especially valuable when the quadratic equation does not factor easily. By completing the square, we can solve any quadratic equation, even those with irrational or complex roots, making it a more effective technique in algebra.
Example 10 Solve the equation $2 z^{2}-12 z+50=0$ by completing square method and hence express it as a product of its linear factors.

Solution $2 z^{2}-12 z+50=0$
Dividing both sides by 2

$$
\begin{aligned}
z^{2}-6 z+25 & =0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad z^{2}-2(3) z & =-25
\end{aligned}
$$

Add $3^{2}$ on both sides

$$
\begin{aligned}
z^{2}-2(3) z+3^{2} & =-25+3^{2} \\
(z-3)^{2} & =-16 \\
\Rightarrow \quad z-3 & = \pm \sqrt{-16} \\
\Rightarrow \quad z & =3 \pm 4 i
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, $z=3+4$ ior $z=3-4$ iare the required complex roots.
Using the corollary of Fundamental theorem of Algebra the equation can be factorized using the roots $3+4 i$ and $3-4 i$ as:
$2 z^{2}-12 z+50=2\left(z^{2}-6 z+25\right)=2(z-(3+4 i))(z-(3-4 i))=2(z-3-4 i)(z-3+4 i)$
Hence, $2 z^{2}-12 z+50=2(z-3-4 i)(z-3+4 i)$

# 1.4 Three Cube Roots of Unity

Let $x$ be a cube root of unity

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad x=(1)^{\frac{1}{3}} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad x^{3}=1 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad x^{3}-1=0 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad(x-1)\left(x^{2}+x+1\right)=0 \\
& \text { Either } \quad x-1=0 \Rightarrow x=1 \\
& \text { or } \quad x^{2}+x+1=0 \\
& \therefore \quad x=\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1-4}}{2} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad x=\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{3} i}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Note

We know that the numbers containing $i$ are called imaginary numbers. So $\frac{-1+\sqrt{3} i}{2}$ and $\frac{-1-\sqrt{3} i}{2}$ are called imaginary cube roots of unity.

Thus, the three cube roots of unity are:

$$
1, \frac{-1+\sqrt{3} i}{2} \text { and } \frac{-1-\sqrt{3} i}{2}
$$
