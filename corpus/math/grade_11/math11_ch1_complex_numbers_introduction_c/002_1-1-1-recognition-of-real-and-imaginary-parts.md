### 1.1.1 Recognition of Real and Imaginary Parts

Let us start with considering the following equation:

$$
x^{2}+1 \Rightarrow x^{2}=-1 \Rightarrow x= \pm \sqrt{-1}
$$

$\sqrt{-1}$ does not belong to the set of real numbers. We, therefore, for convenience call it imaginary number and denote it by $i$ (read as iota).

## Note

Every real number is a complex number with 0 as its imaginary part.

In the complex number $z=a+i b, a$ is called real part and $b$ is called imaginary part of the complex number. For convenient, real part is denoted by $\operatorname{Re} z$ and imaginary part by $\operatorname{Im} z$ of a complex number $z$. For example, if $z=3+4 i$, then

$$
\operatorname{Re} z=3 \text { and } \operatorname{Im} z=4
$$

The product of a non-zero real number and $i$ is also an imaginary number.
For example, $2 i,-3 i, \sqrt{5} i,-\frac{11}{2} i$ are all imaginary numbers.

Conjugate of Complex Numbers: Let $z=a+i b$ be a complex number, then $a-i b$ is called the complex conjugate of $a+i b$. It is denoted by $\bar{z}$. Thus $5-4 i$ is complex conjugate of $5+4 i$ and $-2-3 i$ is complex conjugate of $-2+3 i$.

# Note A real number is self-conjugate.
