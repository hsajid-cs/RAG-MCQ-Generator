### 12.1.1 Meaning of the Phrase " $x$ approaches zero"

Suppose a sequence $x_{n}=\frac{1}{n^{2}}$ assumes a sequence of values as:

$$
\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2^{2}}, \frac{1}{2^{3}}, \frac{1}{2^{4}} \cdots, \frac{1}{2^{n}}, \cdots
$$

We can see that the sequence $x_{n}=\frac{1}{n^{2}}$ is becoming smaller and smaller as $n$ increases and can be made as small as we please by taking " $n$ " sufficiently large. In other words, $x_{n}=\frac{1}{n^{2}}$ becoming closer and closer to 0 as $n$ becoming large. This unending decrease of $x_{n}$ is denoted by $x_{n} \rightarrow 0$ and read as " $x_{n}$ approaches zero" or " $x_{n}$ tends to zero as $n \rightarrow \infty$. That is, the limit of the sequence $x_{n}$ is 0 .
