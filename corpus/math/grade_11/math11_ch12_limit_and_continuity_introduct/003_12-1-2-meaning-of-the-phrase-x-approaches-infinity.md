### 12.1.2 Meaning of the Phrase " $x$ approaches infinity"

Suppose a sequence $x_{n}=10^{n}$ assumes values as $1,10,10^{2}, 10^{3}, \ldots, 10^{n}, \ldots$
It is clear that the sequence $x_{n}$ is becoming larger and larger as $n$ increases and can be made as large as we please by taking $n$ sufficiently large. This unending increase of the sequence $x_{n}$ is symbolically written as " $x_{n} \rightarrow \infty$ " and is read as " $x_{n}$ approaches infinity" or " $x_{n}$ tends to infinity" as $n \rightarrow \infty$

# 12.1.3 Meaning of the Phrase " $x$ approaches $a$ "

Symbolically it is written as " $x \rightarrow a$ " which means that $x$ is sufficiently close to $a$ but different from the number $a$, from both the left and right sides of $a$ that is $x-a$ becomes smaller and smaller as we please but $x-a \neq 0$.

Point to remember:
The symbol $x \rightarrow 0$ is quite different from $x=0$.
$x \rightarrow 0$ means that $x$ is very close to zero but not actually zero.
$x=0$ means that $x$ is actually zero.
