### 12.1.4 Concept of Limit of a Function

## (1) By Finding the Area of Circumscribed Regular Polygon

Consider a circle of unit radius which circumscribes a square (4-sided regular polygon) as shown in Figure 12.1.
The side of square is $\sqrt{2}$ and its area is 2 square units. It is clear that the area of inscribed 4 -sided polygon is less than the area of the circum-circle $\pi=3.142\left(\pi r^{2}=\pi(1)^{2}=\pi=3.142\right)$
Figure 12.1: 4 -sided polygon
Figure 12.2: 8 -sided polygon
Figure 12.3:16-sided polygon

Bisecting the arcs between the vertices of the square, we get an inscribed 8 -sided regular polygon as shown in Figure 12.2. Its area is $2 \sqrt{2}=2.828$ square units which is closer to the area of circum-circle. A further similar bisection of the arcs gives an inscribed 16 -sided regular polygon as shown in Figure 12.3 with area 3.061 square units which is more closer to the area of circum-circle.
It follows that as " $n$ ", the number of sides of the inscribed polygon increases, the area of polygon increases and becoming near to 3.142 which is the area of circle of unit radius.

We express this situation by saying that the limiting value of the area of the inscribed polygon is the area of the circle as $n$ approaches infinity, i.e.,

Area of inscribed polygon $\rightarrow$ Area of circle as $n \rightarrow \infty$

# (ii) Numerical Approach

Consider the function $f(x)=x^{3}$
The domain of $f(x)$ is the set of all real numbers.
Let us find the limit of $f(x)=x^{3}$ as $x$ approaches 2 .
The table of values of $f(x)$ for different values of $x$ as $x$ approaches 2 from left and right is as follows:

From left of $2 \longrightarrow 2$ from right of 2

| $x$ | 1 | 1.5 | 1.8 | 1.9 | 1.99 | 1.999 | 1.9999 | 2.0001 | 2.001 | 2.01 | 2.1 | 2.2 | 2.5 | 3 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $f(x)=x^{3}$ | 1 | 3.375 | 5.832 | 6.859 | 7.8806 | 7.8806 | 7.9988 | 8.0012 | 8.012 | 8.1206 | 9.261 | 10.648 | 15.625 | 27 |

The table shows that, as $x$ gets closer and closer to 2 (sufficiently close to 2 ), from both sides, $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to 8 .
We say that 8 is the limit of $f(x)$ when $x$ approaches 2 and is written as:

$$
f(x) \rightarrow 8 \text { as } x \rightarrow 2 \quad \text { or } \quad \lim _{x \rightarrow 2} x^{2}=8
$$
