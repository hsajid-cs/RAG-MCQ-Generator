### 2.1 Concept of Function

The term function was recognized by a German Mathematician Leibniz (1646-1716) to describe the dependence of one quantity on another. The following examples illustrate how this term is used:
(i) The area $A$ of a square depends on one of its sides $x$ by the formula $A=x^{2}$, so we say that $A$ is a function of $x$.
(ii) The volume " $V$ " of a sphere depends on its radius $r$ by the formula $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$, so we say that $V$ is a function of $r$.
A function is a rule of correspondence, relating two sets in such a way that each element in the first set corresponds to one and only one element in the second set.
Thus in, (i) above, a square of a given side has only one area and in, (ii) above, a sphere of a given radius has only one volume.
Now we have a formal definition:
