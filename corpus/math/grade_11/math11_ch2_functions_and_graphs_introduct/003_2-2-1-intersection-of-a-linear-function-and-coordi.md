### 2.2.1 Intersection of a Linear Function and Coordinate Axes

As we know that linear function is a function in which the highest power of the variable is one. While the coordinate axes refers to $x$-axis and $y$-axis in the Cartesian coordinate system.

Example 7 Find the points of intersection of a linear function $y=2 x+6$ and coordinate axes graphically.
Solution Table of values of $y=2 x+6$ are given below:

| $x$ | $y=2 x+6$ |
| :--: | :--: |
| -1 | 4 |
| 0 | 6 |
| 1 | 8 |

Hence, from the above graph, the points $(-3,0)$ and $(0,6)$ are the points of intersection of $y=2 x+6$ and coordinate axes.

# 2.2.2 Intersection of Two Linear Functions

The point of intersection of two linear functions is the point where their graphs cross each other. This means the two functions have the same $x$ and $y$ values at that point.
Example 8 Find the point of intersection of $y=3 x+2$ and $y=-x+6$ graphically.
Solution Table of different values of $x$ and $y$ is given below:

| $x$ | $y=3 x+2$ | $y=-x+6$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| -1 | -1 | 7 |
| 0 | 2 | 6 |
| 1 | 5 | 5 |

By plotting the above points, we see that $(1,5)$ is the point of intersection of both the straight lines as shown in figure.
