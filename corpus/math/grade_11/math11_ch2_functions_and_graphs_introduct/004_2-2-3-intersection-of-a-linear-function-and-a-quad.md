### 2.2.3 Intersection of a Linear Function and a Quadratic Function

A line and a parabola can either intersect at two points, one point or not as intersect at all. If there are two solutions, the system has two points of intersection. A single solution indicates that there is only one intersection point, suggesting that the line may be tangent to the parabola. If no solution exists, it means the line and the

parabola do not intersect.
Example 9 Solve the linear function $y=-x+3$ and quadratic function $y=x^{2}-6 x+3$ graphically.
Solution Clearly $(3,0)$ and $(0,3)$ are the $x$-intercept and $y$-intercept respectively of $y=-x+3$.

$$
y=x^{2}-6 x+3
$$

Put $x=0$ in (i), so $(0,3)$ is the $y$-intercept.
Put $y=0$ in (i), we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 & =x^{2}-6 x+3 \\
x & =\frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^{2}-4(1)(3)}}{2(1)} \\
& =\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36-12}}{2}=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{24}}{2} \\
& =\frac{6 \pm 2 \sqrt{6}}{2}=3 \pm \sqrt{6} \\
& =3-\sqrt{6}, 3+\sqrt{6}=0.6,5.4
\end{aligned}
$$

So $(0.6,0)$ and $(5.4,0)$ are the $x$-intercepts.
Now we find vertex $(h, k)$ of the parabola

$$
\begin{aligned}
& h=-\frac{b}{2 a}=-\frac{-6}{2(1)}=3 \\
& k=(3)^{2}-6(3)+3=-6
\end{aligned}
$$

So, the vertex is $(3,-6)$.
Hence $(0,3)$ and $(5,-2)$ are the solutions (points of intersection) of the given functions.

# 2.3 Graph of the Square Root Function

Example 10 Graph the square root function $y=2 \sqrt{x}+1$
Solution Clearly the domain of $y=2 \sqrt{x}+1$ is $x \geq 0$, as the square root of a negative number is not a real number. The range of $y=2 \sqrt{x}+1$ is $y \geq 1$,
Table of values and the graph of the function are given below:

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | $\boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{2} \sqrt{\boldsymbol{x}}+\mathbf{1}$ |
