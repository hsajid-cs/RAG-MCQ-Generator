### 5.1.1 Proper Rational Fraction

A rational fraction $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ is called a Proper Rational Fraction if the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$ in the numerator is less than the degree of the polynomial $Q(x)$ in the denominator. For example, $\frac{3}{x+1}, \frac{2 x-5}{x^{2}+4}$ and $\frac{9 x^{2}}{x^{3}-1}$ are proper rational fractions or proper fractions.
