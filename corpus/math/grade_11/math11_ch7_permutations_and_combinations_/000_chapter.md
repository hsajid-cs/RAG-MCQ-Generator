## Permutations and Combinations

## INTRODUCTION

In our daily life, permutations and combinations play a vital role in counting total number of possibilities, as well as in arrangements and selections of objects. They are used in many fields of science. For example,

- In probability theory, permutations and combinations are used to compute how many times an event can occur in various scenarios and to estimate the odds of winning a lottery.
- In biology, these are used to find out the total numbers of possible DNA sequences.
- In computer science, these are used to count the possible number of passwords of a given length by using some specific characters.
- Moreover, these are the important parts of many encryption algorithms to ensure the privacy and integrity of a data set.

### 7.1 Fundamental Principle of Counting

Danish wants to prepare invitation cards of 5 different colours (red, blue, green, orange and yellow) by changing any of 3 shapes (circle, square and rectangle). How many cards can Danish make?
The problem is to count the total number of ways in which Danish can make cards. One way to find the solution is by making tree diagram. Let us discuss another scenario: Danish's father wants to buy a table and has asked his son to help him decide. He narrowed down his options for manufacturer, types of material (wood, plastic, glass and marble) and types of shape (circle, square and rectangle). Find the total number of table choices from the above options.
Again the problem is to count the total number of ways in which Danish's father can choose a table.

$1^{\text {st }}$ Way: By making tree diagram.
From tree diagram, it is clearer there are 12 choices for Danish's father to buy a table with one type of material and one type of shape.
$2^{\text {nd }}$ Way: By multiplying, Danisth's father can find the total number of table choices to buy a table with one kind of material and shape.
Total number of table choices $=$ Total types of material $\times$ Total types of shape

$$
=4 \times 3=12 \text { choices }
$$

These examples show that when making a choice involving multiple stages or categories, we can find the total number of outcomes by multiplying the number of options at each stage.

# Statement

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two events, the event $A$ occurs in $m$ different ways, and the event $B$ occurs in $n$ different ways then the total number of ways that the two events one after another can occur in $m \times n$ ways.

$$
\text { Total number of ways }=m n
$$

Proof: Let $A=\left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \cdots, a_{m}\right\}$ and $B=\left\{b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, \cdots, b_{n}\right\}$. Let $P$ denotes the event that both events $A$ and $B$ occur together then $P=\left\{\left(a_{i}, b_{j}\right): a_{i} \in A, b_{j} \in B, 1 \leq i \leq m\right.$, $1 \leq j \leq n\}=A \times B$. Hence the number of ways in which both events $A$ and $B$ can occur is the number of elements in $A \times B$ which is $m n$.
This principle can be extended to three or more events. For instance, if event $A$ can occur in $m$ ways, event $B$ can occur in $n$ ways and event $C$ can occur in $k$ ways, the number of ways that three events can occur all together is the

product $m \cdot n \cdot k$.

## Factorial (I)

Suppose there are four chairs to be occupied by four students and we are interested in counting all the possible ways the students can be seated.
To occupy the first chair there are 4 options. For the second chair, only 3 students remain, so there are 3 options. Similarly, for the third and fourth chairs, there are 2 and 1 options respectively.

In this way, we have to perform four independent events with $4,3,2$, and 1 options respectively.
By the Fundamental Principle of Counting, the total number of ways to occupy all the chairs is $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1=24$
Such problems frequently occur in daily life, where we have to multiply the first $n$ natural numbers: $1,2,3, \cdots, n$.
We call this product the factorial of $n$ and denote it by $n!$ or $\mid n$, thus for a natural number $n$ :

$$
n!\text { or } \quad \underline{n}=n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1
$$

For some reason we also define $0!=1$. In general, if $n$ is a non-negative integer, then its factorial is denoted and defined as

$$
n!=\mid \underline{n}= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } n=0 \\ n(n-1)(n-2) \ldots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 & \text { if } n \geq 1\end{cases}
$$

For example,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 1!=1 \\
& 2!=2 \cdot 1=2 \\
& 3!=3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1=6 \\
& 4!=4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1=24 \\
& 5!=5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1=120 \\
& 6!=6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1=720
\end{aligned}
$$

Challenged
Can you find out $\frac{81}{3!}$ ?

It can be easily observed that

$$
n!=n(n-1)!\text { for } n \geq 1
$$

Example 1 Evaluate $\frac{8!}{6!}$
Solution $\frac{8!}{6!}=\frac{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}=56$
Example 2 Write $8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5$ in the factorial form.

Solution $8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5=\frac{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}=\frac{8!}{4!}$ or $\frac{9!}{6!3!}=\frac{9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}=84$

### 7.2 Permutations

One important application of the fundamental principle of counting is to determine the number of ways that objects can be arranged in order.
Definition: An arrangement of all or part of set of objects in a specific order is called a permutation. Number of permutations of $r(\leq n)$ objects taken from a set of $n$ objects is written as ${ }^{\circ} P_{r}$ or $P\left(n_{r} r_{r}\right)$.

$$
{ }^{\circ} P_{r}=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \quad \text { when } r \leq n
$$

According to fundamental principle of counting:
(i) Three books of mathematics for grades 1,2 and 3 can be arranged in a row taken all at a time (if books are distinct)

$$
\begin{aligned}
{ }^{\circ} P_{r} & ={ }^{3} P_{3} & \because n=r \approx 3 \\
& =\frac{3!}{(3-3)!}=\frac{3!}{0!} & \because 0!=1 \\
& =3!=3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1=6 \text { ways }
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) Number of ways of writing the letters of the WORD taken all at a time
$$
\begin{aligned}
& { }^{n} P_{r}={ }^{4} P_{4} \\
& n=r=4 \\
& n=\text { Total number of things/objects } \\
& =\frac{4!}{(4-4)!}=\frac{4!}{0!} \\
& r=\text { The number of selected things / objects } \\
& =4!=4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1=24 \text { ways }
\end{aligned}
$$

Theorem: Prove that: ${ }^{n} P_{r}=n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots(n-r+1)=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
Proof: As there are $n$ different objects to fill up $r$ places. So, the first place can be filled in $n$ ways. Since repetitions are not allowed, so after placing one object we are left with $(n-1)$ objects, thus the second place can be filled in $(n-1)$ ways. Similarly the third place can be filled in $(n-2)$ ways, and so on. This continues until the $r^{\text {th }}$ place which can be filled in $n-(r-1)=n-r+1$ ways. Therefore, by the Fundamental Principle of Counting, $r$ places can be filled by $n$ different objects in $n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots(n-r+1)$ ways.

$$
\begin{aligned}
{ }^{n} P_{r} & =n(n-1)(n-2) \ldots(n-r+1) \\
& =\frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \ldots(n-r+1)(n-r)!}{(n-r)!} \\
{ }^{n} P_{r} & =\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 4 How many different 4-digit numbers can be formed out from the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6$, when no digit is repeated?
Solution The total number of digits $=6$
The digits forming each number $=4$
So, the required number of 4-digit numbers is given by:

$$
{ }^{6} P_{4}=\frac{6!}{(6-4)!}=\frac{6!}{2!}=\frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{2.1}=6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3=360
$$

(c) only the mathematics books are kept together.

# Soiation

(a) all the books are kept without any restriction.
Total number of books $=4+3+2=9$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& { }^{9} P_{2}=9!=9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \quad 91 \text { ways } \\
& =362880 \text { ways }

\end{aligned}
$$

# 7.3 Permutation of Objects Not All Different

Suppose we have to find the permutations of the letters of the word BITTER using all the letters. The word BIT ${ }_{1} \mathrm{~T}_{2}$ ER consists of 6 different letters which can be permuted among themselves in 6 ! ways.
We can see that all the letters of the word BITTER are not different. It has 2Ts in it. We can see there are 2 ! ways of replacing two $\mathrm{T}_{8}$ :

BITT $T_{1}$ ER
BITT $T_{1}$ ER
The replacement of the two $\mathrm{T}_{8}$ by $\mathrm{T}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{2}$ in any other permutation will give rise to 2 permutations.
Hence, the number of permutations of the letters of the word BITTER taken all at a time.

$$
\frac{6!}{2!}=\frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{2.1}=360 \text { ways }
$$

## Remember!

If there are $n_{1}$ alike objects of one kind, $n_{2}$ alike objects of second kind and $n_{n}$ alike objects are of third kind, then the number of permutations of $n$ objects taken all at a time is given by:

$$
\frac{n!}{n_{1}!\cdot n_{2}!\cdot n_{3}!}=\binom{n}{n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3}}
$$

Example 7 In how many ways can the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI be arranged when all the letters are to be used?
Solution Total number of letters in the word $=11$

## MISSISSIPPI

I is repeated 4 times $=4$ I ways
$S$ is repeated 4 times $=4$ I ways
$P$ is repeated 2 times $=2$ I ways
$M$ comes once only $=11$ ways
Required number of permutations $=\frac{11!}{4!\cdot 4!\cdot 2!\cdot 1!}=34650$ ways

## Circular Permutations

The permutations in which the object are arranged in a circular order are known as circular permutations.

## Note:

The following circular arrangements are reflection of each other and considered same when anticlockwise and clockwise arrangements are considered identical.
Circular permutations can occur in two cases:
Case-I: When clockwise and anticlockwise arrangements are considered different In a linear arrangement, changing the order of objects results in a new arrangement. However, in a circular arrangement, rotating the entire circle does not produce a new, distinct arrangement.

For example, suppose three people $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and C are sitting around a round table. The following three linear arrangements
$\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{B}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{B}$ are considered the same in circular permutations because each one is simply a rotation of the other.
We conclude that:
3 linear permutations gives 1 circular permutation.
3 ! linear permutations gives $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 3!=\frac{3!}{3}=2$ ! permutations.
Generalizing the above idea if $n$ objects are arranged in a circle, the number of distinct circular permutations is $\frac{n!}{n}=(n-1)!$.

Case-II: When clockwise and anticlockwise arrangements are considered identical
In many real-life situations, a circular permutation and its mirror image are not considered different.
For example, if three beads red, blue, and black are arranged in a ring, then an arrangement and its reflection (as shown in the figure) are considered the same.
In such cases, we divide the total number of circular permutations by 2 to eliminate symmetrical duplicates.
Thus, in this case the number of distinct circular permutations is:

$$
\frac{(n-1)!}{2}
$$

Example 8 In how many ways can 4 persons be seated at a round table, while:
(i) clockwise and anticlockwise orders are different
(ii) clockwise and anticlockwise orders are identical.

Solution Let $A, B, C$ and $D$ be the 4 persons.
(i) If clockwise and anticlockwise orders are different

# According to Case-I

The possible number of ways are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(n-1)!\text { ways } \\
& =(4-1)!=3! \\
& =3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1=6 \text { ways. }
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) If clockwise and anticlockwise orders are identical

According to Case-II
The possible number of ways are $=\frac{(n-1)!}{2}$ ways

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{(4-1)!}{2}=\frac{31}{2} \\
& =\frac{3 \cdot 2}{2}=3 \text { ways }
\end{aligned}
$$

# 7.4 Combinations

Suppose, a teacher uses the names of few students to make a team for a writing competition. Such as Ahmad, Sana, Hamza and Danish. As a combination of team members, (Ahmad, Sana, Hamza and Danish) is equivalent to (Hamza, Ahmad, Danish and Sana). Because same students are in the combination. Consequently, you have the same team because the order of the name of the students does not matter.
So, we are interested in the membership of the

| Ahmad | Sana | Hamza | Danish |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Hamza | Ahmad | Danish | Sana |

team and not in the ways the students are listed (arranged).

## Definition

A combination of $r$ objects taken out of $n$ objects is a subset of $r$ objects of a set of $n$ objects.
The number of combinations of $n$ different objects taken $r$ at a time is denoted by ${ }^{n} C_{r}$ or $C(n, r)$ or $\binom{n}{r}$ and is given by ${ }^{n} C_{r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.
Theorem. Prove that ${ }^{n} C_{r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.
Proof: Elements of a subset of $r$ objects of a set of $n$ objects can be arranged among themselves in $r$ ! ways. So, each combination will give rise to $r$ ! permutation. Thus, there will be ${ }^{n} C_{r} \times r$ ! permutations of $n$ different objects taken $r$ at a time that is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& { }^{n} C_{r} \times r!={ }^{n} P_{r} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad{ }^{n} C_{r} \times r!=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \quad \therefore \quad{ }^{n} C_{r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\end{aligned}
$$

Which completes the proof.

## Corollary:

(i) If $r=n$, then ${ }^{n} C_{n}=\frac{n!}{n!(n-n)!}=\frac{n!}{n!0!}=1$
(ii) If $r=0$, then ${ }^{n} C_{0}=\frac{n!}{0!(n-0)!}=\frac{n!}{0!n!}=1$

## Remember!

The formulae ${ }^{n} P_{r}$ and ${ }^{n} C_{r}$ are also known as counting formulae. Because, they are used to count the possible number of ways without listing them all.

# 7.4.1 Applications of Combination in Real Life

Example 9 Zain has 8 different fruits. He wants to select 5 fruits out of 8 fruits to make a fruit chat. How many combinations of fruits he can select?
Solution To solve this problem, we have to find the number of combinations of 5 fruits out of 8 fruits. In this situation, $n=8$ and $r=5$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
{ }^{n} C_{r} & =\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\
\text { After putting values } \\
\begin{aligned}
{ }^{8} C_{3} & =\frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!}=\frac{8!}{5!\cdot 3!} \\
& =\frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5!}{5!\cdot 3!}=\frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} \\
& =8 \times 7=56 \text { ways }
\end{aligned}
$$

Zain has 56 different ways to select 5 different fruits to make a fruit chat.
Example10 In a school, a class consists of 12 girls and 8 boys. The teacher wants to select 5 students for an activity. In how many ways can the students be selected including? (i) 2 girls
(ii) 5 boys
(iii) 2 boys

| Solution | Number of girls $=12$ | Challenge! |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | Number of boys $=8$ | A restaurant offers 6 flavours of pizza. How many ways are there to select 2 flavours of pizza? |

(i) Now let's find the total number of ways to select students when exactly 2 are girls.
${ }^{12} C_{2}{ }^{8} C_{3}=\frac{12!}{2!10!} \cdot \frac{8!}{3!5!}=\frac{12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10!}{2 \cdot 10!} \cdot \frac{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5!}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 5!}=3696$
(ii) Let's find total number of ways to select students when exactly 5 students are boys.

$$
{ }^{8} C_{3}=\frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!}=\frac{8!}{5!3!}=\frac{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5!}{5!3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}=56
$$

(iii) Let's find total number of ways to select students when exactly 2 students are boys.

$$
{ }^{8} C_{2}{ }^{12} C_{3}=\frac{8!}{2!6!} \cdot \frac{12!}{3!9!}=\frac{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6!}{2 \cdot 6!} \cdot \frac{12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9!}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 9!}=36960
$$

### 7.4.2 Complementary Combinations

Theorem. Prove that: ${ }^{n} C_{r}={ }^{n} C_{n-r}$
Proof: If from $n$ different objects, we select $r$ objects then $(n-r)$ objects are left. Corresponding to every combination of $r$ objects, there is a combination of $(n-r)$

objects and vice versa. Thus, the number of combinations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time is equal to the number of combinations of $n$ objects taken $(n-r)$ at a time.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad{ }^{n} C_{r} & ={ }^{n} C_{n-r} \\
{ }^{n} C_{n-r} & =\frac{n!}{(n-r)!(n-n+r)!} \\
& =\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\
{ }^{n} C_{n-r} & ={ }^{n} C_{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note
This result will be found useful in evaluating
${ }^{n} C_{r}$ when $r>\frac{n}{2}$.
For example,
${ }^{12} C_{10}={ }^{12} C_{12-10}={ }^{12} C_{2}=\frac{(12) \cdot(11)}{2}=6 \cdot 11=66$

Note
${ }^{n} C_{r}$ and ${ }^{n} C_{n-r}$ are known as complementary combinations.
Example 11 Find the number of the diagonals of a 6 -sided figure.
Solution A 6 -sided figure has 6 vertices. By joining any two vertices, we get a line segment.
$\therefore \quad$ Number of line segments $={ }^{6} C_{2}=\frac{6!}{2!4!}=15$
But these line segments include 6 sides of the figure
$\therefore \quad$ number of diagonals $=15-6=9$

# Application of Permutations and Combinations in Cryptography

Example 12 Zain wants to generate a password for his laptop to secure the data. He can take only 6 characters to generate a password. Each character can either be an upper case letter $(A-Z)$ or digits from $(0-9)$.
Can you tell how many passwords can be generated by using the above letters and digits:
(i) if repetition of characters is not allowed
(ii) if repetition of characters is allowed

Solution
Total number of letters $=26$
Total number of digits $=10$
Total number of letters and digits $=26+10=36$
$n=$ total number of characters $=36$
$r=$ required number of characters $=6$
(i) If repetition of characters is not allowed, we find out total possible permutations as.

$$
\begin{aligned}
{ }^{n} P_{r}={ }^{36} P_{0} & =\frac{36!}{(36-6)!}=\frac{36!}{30!} \\
& =\frac{36 \cdot 35 \cdot 34 \cdot 33 \cdot 32 \cdot 31 \cdot 30!}{30!} \\
& =36 \cdot 35 \cdot 34 \cdot 33 \cdot 32 \cdot 31 \\
& =1,402,410,240 \text { ways }
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, $1,402,410,240$ passwords can be generated by using the 26 alphabet and 10 digits. (If repetition of the characters is not allowed)
(ii) If the repetition of the characters is allowed Using fundamental principle of counting:
The total number of possible combinations $=36 \times 36 \times 36 \times 36 \times 36 \times 36=36^{6}$ Hence, $36^{6}$ passwords can be generated by using the 26 alphabets and 10 digits, If repetition of characters is allowed.
Application of permutations to estimate the odd of winning the lottery.
Example 13 A box contains 15 cards from ( $1-15$ ). Danish is to select 5 cards. If all the selected cards are the first five multiples of 2 then Danish will win the game. Find Danish's chance of winning the game, when
(i) order is important
(ii) order is not important

Solution $n=$ total number of cards $=15$
$r=$ required number of cards $=5$
(i) When order is important,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Total possible ways } & ={ }^{n} P_{r}={ }^{15} P_{0}=\frac{15!}{(15-5)!} \\
& =\frac{15!}{10!}=360,360 \text { ways }
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, Danish's chance to win the game $=\frac{1}{360,360}=0.000002775$

(ii) When order is not important

$$
\begin{aligned}
& n=\text { Total number of cards }=15 \\
& r=\text { Required number of cards }=5
\end{aligned}
$$

Total possible ways $={ }^{a} C_{r}={ }^{15} C_{5}=\frac{15!}{5!(15-5)!}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{15!}{5!10!}=\frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10!}{51.10!} \\
& =\frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}=3003 \text { ways }
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, Danish's chance to win the game $=\frac{1}{3003}=0.00033$
Application of Permutation and Combination to choose different sets of songs for Certain Occasions
Example 14 On Independence Day, a DJ has a list of ten different national songs. He wants to select any five national songs for the day. Find how many ways he can select and play the songs:
(i) if the order of playing the songs matters
(ii) if the order of playing the songs does not matter

Solution (i) When order matters

$$
\begin{aligned}
& n=\text { total number of national songs }=10 \\
& r=\text { required number of national songs }=5
\end{aligned}
$$

Total number of ways $={ }^{a} P_{1}={ }^{10} P_{5}$

$$
=\frac{10!}{(10-5)!}=\frac{10!}{5!}=30,240 \text { ways }
$$

Hence, the DJ can play the five national songs in 30,240 different ways.
(ii) When order is not matter
$n=$ total number of national songs $=10$
$r=$ total number of selected national songs $=5$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Total number of ways } & ={ }^{a} C_{r}={ }^{10} C_{5}=\frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!} \\
& =\frac{10!}{51.5!}=252 \text { ways }
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, the DJ can play the five national songs in 252 different ways.
