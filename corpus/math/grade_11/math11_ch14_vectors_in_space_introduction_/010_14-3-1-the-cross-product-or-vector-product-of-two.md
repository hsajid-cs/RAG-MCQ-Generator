### 14.3.1 The Cross Product or Vector Product of Two Vectors and its Geometrical Interpretation

One of the key multiplication operations involving vectors in space is the cross product. Unlike the dot product, which results is a scalar, the cross product of two vectors yields a vector quantity. The vector product of two vectors is widely used in Physics, particularly in fields of mechanics and electricity. It is only defined for vectors in space. Let $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$ be two non-zero vectors. The cross or vector product of $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$ gives a

vector that is perpendicular to both the vectors $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$, written as $\underline{u} \times \underline{v}$, is defined by

$$
\underline{u} \times \underline{v}=(\|\underline{u}\| \mid \underline{v} \mid \sin \theta) \underline{n}
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors, such that $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$ and $\underline{n}$ is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$ with direction given by the right-hand rule.

(i) If the fingers of the right hand point along the vector $\underline{u}$ and then curl towards the vector $\underline{v}$, then the thumb will give the direction of $\underline{n}$ which is $\underline{u} \times \underline{v}$. It is shown in the figure (a).
(ii) In figure (b), the right hand rule shows the direction of $\underline{v} \times \underline{u}$.

# 14.3.2 Parallel Vectors

If $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$ are parallel vectors, then $(\theta=0 \Rightarrow \sin 0=0)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \underline{u} \times \underline{v}=\|\underline{u}\| \mid \underline{v}\| \sin \theta \underline{n} \\
& \underline{u} \times \underline{v}=0 \quad \text { or } \quad \mid \underline{u} \times \underline{v}=0
\end{aligned}
$$

And if $\underline{u} \times \underline{v}=0$, then either $\sin \theta=0 \quad$ or $\quad\|\underline{u}\|=0 \quad$ or $\quad\|\underline{v}\|=0$
(i) If $\sin \theta=0 \Rightarrow \theta=0^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$. Which shows that the vectors $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$ are parallel.
(ii) If $\underline{u}=\underline{0}$ or $\underline{v}=\underline{0}$, then since the zero vector has no specific direction, we adopt the convention that the zero vector is parallel to every vector.

## Note: Zero vector is both parallel and perpendicular to every vector. This apparent contradiction will cause no trouble, since the angle between two vectors is never applied when one of them is zero vector.
