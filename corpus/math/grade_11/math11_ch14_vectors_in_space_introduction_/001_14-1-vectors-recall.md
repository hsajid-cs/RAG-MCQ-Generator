### 14.1 Vectors (Recall)

In previous classes, we learned about two fundamental quantities: scalars and vectors. A scalar is a quantity that has only magnitude or size, such as mass, time, density, temperature, length, volume, speed, work etc. On the other hand, a vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction, for example displacement, velocity, acceleration, weight, force, momentum, electric and magnetic fields, etc.
Geometrically, a vector is represented as a directed line segment $\overrightarrow{A B}$ with $A$ as its initial point and $B$ as the terminal point.
In two-dimension $\left(R^{2}\right)$ a vector has components that can be represented by an ordered pair $[x, y]$ of real numbers. For the vector $\underline{u}=[x, y], x$ and $y$ represent the components of $\underline{u}$.
Addition of Vectors: For any two vectors $\underline{u}=\left[x_{1}, y_{1}\right]$ and $\underline{y}=\left[x_{2}, y_{2}\right]$, we have

$$
\underline{u}+\underline{y}=\left[x_{1}, y_{1}\right]+\left[x_{2}, y_{2}\right]=\left[x_{1}+x_{2}, y_{1}+y_{2}\right]
$$

Scalar Multiplication of a Vector: For $\underline{u}=[x, y]$ and $a \in R$, we have

$$
a \underline{u}=a[x, y]=[a x, a y]
$$

Equal Vectors: Two vectors $\underline{u}=\left[x_{1}, y_{1}\right]$ and $\underline{y}=\left[x_{2}, y_{2}\right]$ of $R^{2}$ are said to be equal

if and only if they have the same components. That is, $\left[x_{1}, y_{1}\right]=\left[x_{2}, y_{2}\right]$ if and only if $x_{1}=x_{2}$ and $y_{1}=y_{2}$ and we write $\underline{u}=\underline{v}$
In other words, two vectors $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$ are said to be equal, if they have same magnitude and same direction.
Parallel Vectors: Two vectors are parallel if and only if they are non-zero scalar multiple of each other.
For example, vectors $\overrightarrow{A B},-\overrightarrow{A B}$ and $\frac{3}{2} \overrightarrow{A B}$ are parallel.

# Magnitude of a Vector

The magnitude (or norm or length) of a vector in 2D represents the length of the vector from the origin to the point represented by the vector. For any vector $\underline{u}=[x, y]$ in $R^{2}$, we define the magnitude, as the distance of the point $P(x, y)$ from the origin $O$.

Magnitude of $\overrightarrow{O P}=|\overrightarrow{O P}|=|\underline{u}|=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$
Now, we will learn some mathematical operations involving vectors in three-dimensional space.
