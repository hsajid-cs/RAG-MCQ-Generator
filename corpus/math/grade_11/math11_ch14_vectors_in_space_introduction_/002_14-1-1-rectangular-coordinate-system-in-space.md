### 14.1.1 Rectangular Coordinate System in Space

In space a rectangular coordinate system is constructed using three mutually orthogonal (perpendicular) axes, which have origin as their common point of intersection. When sketching figures, we follow the convention that the positive $x$-axis points towards the reader, the positive $y$-axis to the right and the positive $z$-axis points upwards.
These axes are also labeled in accordance with the righthand rule. The fingers of the right hand, pointing in the direction of the positive $x$-axis, curled images toward the positive $y$-axis, and the thumb will point in the direction of the positive $z$-axis. A point $P$ in space has three coordinates, one along $x$-axis, the second along $y$-axis and the third along $z$-axis. If the

directed distances along $x$-axis, $y$-axis and $z$-axis respectively are $a, b$ and $c$, then the point $P$ is written with a unique triple of real numbers as $P(a, b, c)$ (see figure).
