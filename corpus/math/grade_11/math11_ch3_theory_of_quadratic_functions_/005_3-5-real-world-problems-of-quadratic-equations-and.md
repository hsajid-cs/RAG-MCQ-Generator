### 3.5 Real World Problems of Quadratic Equations and Inequalities

We shall now proceed to solve the problems which, when expressed symbolically, lead to quadratic equations in one variables.
In order to solve such problems, we must:
(i) Suppose the unknown quantities to be $x$ or $y$ etc.
(ii) Translate the problem into symbols and form the equation or inequality satisfying the given conditions.
The method of solving the problems will be illustrated through the following examples:

Example 9 The length of a room is 3 metres greater than its breadth. If the area of the room is 180 square metres, find length and the breadth of the room.
Solution Let the breadth of room $=x$ metres
and the length of room $=(x+3)$ metres
$\therefore \quad$ Area of the room $=x(x+3)$ square metres
By the given condition, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
x(x+3) & =180 \\
\Rightarrow \quad x^{2}+3 x-180 & =0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad(x+15)(x-12) & =0 \\
\therefore \quad x=-15 \text { or } x & =12
\end{aligned}
$$

As breadth cannot be negative so $x=-15$ is not admissible.
When $x=12$, we get $x+3=12+3=15$
Hence breadth of the room $=12$ metres and length of the room $=15$ metres.
Example 10 A company manufactures laptops and its weekly profit function (in thousands of dollars) is $P(x)=-x^{2}+2 x+3$, where $x$ is the number of laptops produced (in hundreds). Find the range of production levels where the company makes at least $\$ 4,000$ profit.
Solution Here $P(x) \geq 4$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& -x^{2}+2 x+3 \geq 4 \\
& -x^{2}+2 x+3-4 \geq 0 \\
& -x^{2}+2 x-1 \geq 0 \\
& x^{2}-2 x+1 \leq 0 \\
& (x-1)^{2} \leq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

This only holds true when $(x-1)^{2}=0 \Rightarrow x=1$
The company makes exactly $\$ 4,000$ profit when 100 laptops are produced (since $x=1$ means 100 laptops). There is no production level where profit is more than $\$ 4,000$.

# EXERCISE 3.2

1. Solve the following equations:
(i) $\frac{1}{3 x}+\frac{4 x}{6}=1, x \neq 0$
(ii) $\frac{x}{x+1}+\frac{x+1}{x}=\frac{5}{2} ; x \neq-1,0$
(iii) $\frac{1}{x+1}+\frac{2}{x+2}=\frac{7}{x+5} ; x \neq-1,-2,-5$

(iv) $\frac{a}{a x-1}+\frac{b}{b x-1}=a+b ; x \neq \frac{1}{a}, \frac{1}{b}$
(v) $\frac{x+1}{x-1}+\frac{x-1}{x+1}=2, x \neq 1, x \neq-1$
(vi) $3 x^{2}+15 x-2 \sqrt{x^{2}+5 x+1}=2$
(vii) $\sqrt{2 x+8}+\sqrt{x+5}=7$
(viii) $\sqrt{3 x+4}=2+\sqrt{2 x-4}$
(ix) $\sqrt{x+7}+\sqrt{x+2}=\sqrt{6 x+13}$
(x) $\sqrt{x+5}-\sqrt{x-3}=2$

2 A farmer bought some sheep for Rs. 9000. If he had paid Rs. 100 less for each, he would have got 3 sheep more for the same money. How many sheep did he buy, when the rate in each case is uniform?
3. A man sold his stock of eggs for Rs. 2400. If he had 2 dozen more, he would have got the same money by selling the whole for Rs. 0.50 per dozen cheaper. How many dozen eggs did he sell?
4. A cyclist travelled 48 km at a uniform speed. If he had travelled $2 \mathrm{~km} /$ hour slower, he would have taken 2 hours more to perform the journey. How long did he take to cover 48 km ?
5. To do a piece of work, Abdullah takes 10 days more than Abdul Hadi. Together they finish the work in 12 days. How long would Abdul Hadi take to finish it alone?
6. The braking distance (in metres) of a car is modeled by:
$d(s)=0.02 s^{2}+0.1 s$, where $s$ is the speed of car in $\mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h}$
If the maximum safe braking distance is 50 metres, find the range of speed where braking is safe.
7. A rocket follows the height function $h(t)=-5 t^{2}+20 t+30$, where $h(t)$ is the height in metres and $t$ is the time in seconds. Find the time interval during which the rocket is at least 40 metres above the ground.
