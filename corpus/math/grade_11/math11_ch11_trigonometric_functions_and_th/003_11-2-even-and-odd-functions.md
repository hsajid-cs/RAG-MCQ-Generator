### 11.2 Even and Odd Functions

A function $f$ is said to be even if $f(-x)=f(x)$, for every number $x$ in the domain of $f$.
For example: $f(x)=x^{2}$ is even function of $x$. Here

$$
f(-x)=(-x)^{2}=x^{2}=f(x)
$$

## Remember!

The graph of even function is always symmetric about $y$-axis

A function $f$ is said to be odd if $f(-x)=-f(x)$, for every number $x$ in the domain of $f$.
For example: $f(x)=x^{3}$ is an odd function of $x$.
Here $f(-x)=(-x)^{3}=-x^{3}=-f(x)$
The function $f(\theta)=\cos \theta$ for all $\theta \in R$ is an even
function (see figure 11.2).
Here $f(-\theta)=\cos (-\theta)=\cos \theta=f(\theta)$.
Thus, $f(\theta)=\cos \theta$ is an even function.
Similarly, the function $f(\theta)=\sin \theta$ for all $\theta \in R$ is an odd function.
Here $f(-\theta)=\sin (-\theta)=-\sin \theta=-f(\theta)$.
Thus, $f(\theta)=\sin \theta$ is an odd function.
Note In both the cases, for each $x$ in the domain of $f,-x$ must also be in the domain of $f$.

# 11.3 Period of Trigonometric Functions

All the six trigonometric functions repeat their values for each increase or decrease of $2 \pi$ in $\theta$ therefore, the values of trigonometric functions for $\theta$ and $\theta \pm 2 n \pi$, where $\theta \in \mathrm{R}$ and $n \in Z$, are the same. This behaviour of trigonometric functions is called periodicity.
Period of a trigonometric function is the smallest positive number which, when added to the original circular measure of the angle, gives the same value of the function. A function is periodic, if $f(\theta+p)=f(\theta)$, for all $\theta$ in domain of function and the least positive value of $p$ is called the period of the function.
Now, let us discover the periods of the trigonometric functions.
Theorem 11.1: Sine is a periodic function and its period is $2 \pi$.
Proof: Suppose $p$ is the period of sine function such that

$$
\sin (\theta+p)=\sin \theta \text { for all } \theta \in R
$$

Now put $\theta=0$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin (0+p) & =\sin 0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad \sin p & =0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad p & =0,+\pi,+2 \pi,+3 \pi, \ldots
\end{aligned}
$$

(i) If $p=\pi$, then from (A)

$$
\sin (\theta+\pi)=\sin \theta \quad(\text { not true }) \quad \because \sin (\pi+\theta)=-\sin \theta
$$

Thus $\pi$ is not the period of $\sin \theta$
(ii) If $p=2 \pi$, then from (A)

$$
\sin (\theta+2 \pi)=\sin \theta, \quad \text { which is true } \quad \because \sin (0+2 \pi)=\sin 0
$$

As $2 \pi$ is the smallest positive real number for which

$$
\sin (\theta+2 \pi)=\sin \theta
$$

$2 \pi$ is the period of $\sin \theta$.
Theorem 11.2: Tangent is a periodic function and its period is $\pi$.
Proof: Suppose $p$ is the period of tangent function such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \tan (\theta+p)=\tan \theta \quad \text { for all } \theta \in \mathrm{R} \\
& p=0, \pi, 2 \pi, 3 \pi, \ldots
\end{aligned}
$$

(i) If $p=\pi$, then from (B) $\tan (\theta+\pi)=\tan \theta$, which is true
As $\pi$ is the smallest positive number for which $\tan (\theta+\pi)=\tan \theta$
Therefore, $\pi$ is the period of $\tan \theta$.

## Note

By adopting the procedure used in finding the periods of sine and tangent, we can prove that
(i) $2 \pi$ is the period of $\cos \theta$
(ii) $2 \pi$ is the period of $\sec \theta$
(iii) $2 \pi$ is the period of $\sec \theta$
(iv) $\pi$ is the period of $\cot \theta$

Example 1 Find the periods of:
(i) $\sin 2 x$
(ii) $3+\tan \frac{x}{3}$

Solution (i) We know that the period of sine is $2 \pi$

$$
\therefore \quad \sin (2 x+2 \pi)=\sin 2 x \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sin 2(x+\pi)=\sin 2 x
$$

It means that the value of $\sin 2 x$ repeats when $x$ is increased by $\pi$.
Hence $\pi$ is the period of $\sin 2 x$.
(ii) To find the period of $3+\tan \frac{x}{3}$, consider only $\tan \frac{x}{3}$.

We know that the period of tangent is $\pi$
$\tan \left(\frac{x}{3}+\pi\right)=\tan \frac{x}{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \tan \frac{1}{3}(x+3 \pi)=\tan \frac{x}{3}$
It means that the value of $\tan \frac{x}{3}$ repeats when $x$ is increased by $3 \pi$.
Hence the period of $3+\tan \frac{x}{3}$ is $3 \pi$. The addition of constant number 3 to the tangent function does not affect the period.
