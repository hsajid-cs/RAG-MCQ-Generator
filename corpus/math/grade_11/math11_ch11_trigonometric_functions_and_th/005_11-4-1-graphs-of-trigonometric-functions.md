### 11.4.1 Graphs of Trigonometric Functions

To plot the graph we shall follow these steps:
(i) Table of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is constructed, when $x$ is the measure of the angle and $y$ is the value of the trigonometric function for the angle of measure $x$.
(ii) The measures of the angles are taken along the $X$-axis.
(iii) The values of the trigonometric functions are taken along the $Y$-axis.

(iv) The points corresponding to the ordered pairs are plotted on the graph paper.
(v) These points are joined with the help of smooth curves.

# 11.4.2 Graph of $y=\sin x$ from $-2 \pi$ to $2 \pi$

We know that the period of sine function is $2 \pi$ so, we will first draw the graph for the interval from $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ (from 0 to $2 \pi$ ).

To graph the sine function, first, recall that $-1 \leq \sin x \leq 1$ for all $x \in R$.
We know the range of the sine function is $[-1,1]$, so the graph will be between the horizontal lines $y=+1$ and $y=-1$
The table of the ordered pairs satisfying $y=\sin x$ is as follows:

| $x$ | 0 <br> or <br> $0^{\circ}$ | $\begin{gathered} \pi \\ 6 \\ \text { or } \\ 30^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} \pi \\ 3 \\ \text { or } \\ 60^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} \pi \\ 2 \\ \text { or } \\ 90^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} 2 \pi \\ 3 \\ \text { or } \\ 120^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} 5 \pi \\ 6 \\ \text { or } \\ 150^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} \pi \\ 6 \\ \text { or } \\ 180^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} 7 \pi \\ 6 \\ \text { or } \\ 210^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} 4 \pi \\ 3 \\ \text { or } \\ 240^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} 3 \pi \\ 2 \\ \text { or } \\ 270^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} 5 \pi \\ 3 \\ \text { or } \\ 300^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} 11 \pi \\ 6 \\ \text { or } \\ 330^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} 2 \pi \\ 6 \\ \text { or } \\ 360^{\circ} \end{gathered}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $\operatorname{Sin} x$ | 0 | 0.5 | 0.87 | 1 | 0.87 | 0.5 | 0 | $-0.5$ | $-0.87$ | $-1$ | $-0.87$ | $-0.5$ | 0 |

To draw the graph:
(i) Take a convenient scale $\left\{\begin{array}{l}1 \text { side of small square on the } x \text {-axis }=10^{\circ} \\ 1 \text { side of big square on the } y \text {-axis }=1 \text { unit }\end{array}\right.$
(ii) Draw the coordinate axes.
(iii) Plot the points corresponding to the ordered pairs in the table above i.e., $(0,0),\left(30^{\circ}, 0.5\right),\left(60^{\circ}, 0.87\right)$ and so on.
(iv) Join the points with the help of a smooth curve as shown. So, we get the graph of $y=\sin x$ from 0 to $360^{\circ}$ i.e., from 0 to $2 \pi$.

Note As we see that the graphs of trigonometric functions are smooth curves and none of them is line segment or has sharp corners or breaks within their domain. This behaviour of the curve is called continuity. It means that the trigonometric functions are continuous, wherever they are defined. Moreover, as the trigonometric functions are periodic so their curves repeat after fixed intervals.
In the similar way, we can draw the graph for the interval from $0^{\circ}$ to $-360^{\circ}$. This will complete the graph of $y=\sin x$ from $-360^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ (from $-2 \pi$ to $2 \pi$ ), which is given below:
The graph in the interval $[0,2 \pi]$ is called a cycle and the maximum height of the wave from its mid line is called amplitude. Since the period of sine function is $2 \pi$, so the sine graph can be extended on both sides of $x$-axis through every interval of $2 \pi$.
Properties of graph of sine function $(y=\sin x)$
(i) The domain is the set of real numbers $(-\infty<x<\infty)$.
(ii) The range includes all real numbers from -1 to 1 , inclusive, $[-1,1]$.
(iii) The graph of sine function is continuous for all real numbers.
(iv) The period of sine function is $2 \pi$. Mathematically, we can express it as $\sin (\theta+2 \pi)=\sin \theta$
(v) The sine function is an odd function. As the graph of sine function is symmetric about the origin. Mathematically, it can be written as $\sin (-\theta)=-\sin \theta$.
(vi) The maximum value of $y=\sin x$ is 1 when $x=\frac{\pi}{2}+2 \pi n$, where $n \in \mathbf{Z}$.
(vii) The minimum value of $y=\sin x$ is -1 when $x=\frac{3 \pi}{2}+2 \pi n$, where $n \in \mathbf{Z}$.
(viii) The $x$-intercepts of the sine function occurs at $x=\pi n$, where $n \in \mathbf{Z}$.
(ix) The $y$-intercept of the sine function is 0 .
(x) The amplitude of sine function is 1 .
(xi) In unit circle $\sin \theta$ is equal to the $y$-coordinate of the given point.

# 11.4.3 Graph of $y=\cos x$ from $-2 \pi$ to $2 \pi$

We know that the period of cosine function is $2 \pi$ so, we will first draw the graph for the interval from $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ (from 0 to $2 \pi$ ).
We know the range of the cosine function is $[-1,1]$, so the graph will be between the horizontal lines $y=+1$ and $y=-1$.

The table of the ordered pairs satisfying $y=\cos x$ is as follows:

| $x$ | 0 | $\pi$ | $\pi$ | $\pi$ | $2 \pi$ | $5 \pi$ | $\pi$ | $7 \pi$ | $4 \pi$ | $3 \pi$ | $5 \pi$ | $11 \pi$ | $2 \pi$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | or | or | or | or | or | or | or | or | or | or | or | or | or |
|  | $0^{\circ}$ | $30^{\circ}$ | $60^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ | $120^{\circ}$ | $150^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $210^{\circ}$ | $240^{\circ}$ | $270^{\circ}$ | $300^{\circ}$ | $330^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ |
| $\cos x$ | 1 | 0.87 | 0.5 | 0 | $-0.5$ | $-0.87$ | -1 | $-0.87$ | $-0.5$ | 0 | 0.5 | 0.87 | 1 |

The graph of $y=\cos x$ from $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ is given below:
In the similar way, we can draw the graph for the interval from $0^{\circ}$ to $-360^{\circ}$. This will complete the graph of $y=\cos x$ from $-360^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ i.e. from $-2 \pi$ to $2 \pi$, which is given below:
As in the case of sine graph, the cosine graph is also extended on both sides of $x$-axis through an interval of $2 \pi$.
Properties of graph of cosine function $(y=\cos x)$
(i) The domain is the set of real numbers $(-\infty<x<\infty)$.
(ii) The range includes all real numbers from -1 to 1 , inclusive, $[-1,1]$.
(iii) The graph of cosine function is continuous for all real numbers.
(iv) The period of cosine function is $2 \pi$. Mathematically, we can express it as $\cos (\theta+2 \pi)=\cos \theta$

(v) The cosine function is an even function, as the graph of cosine function is symmetric about the $y$-axis. Mathematically, it can be written as $\cos (-\theta)=\cos \theta$.
(vi) The maximum value of $y=\cos x$ is 1 when $x=\pi n$, where $n$ is an even integer.
(vii) The minimum value of $y=\cos x$ is -1 when $x=\pi n$, where $n$ is an odd integer.
(viii) The $x$-intercepts of the cosine function occurs at $x=\frac{\pi}{2}+\pi n$, where $n \in \mathbf{Z}$.
(ix) The $y$-intercept of the cosine function is 1 .
(x) The amplitude of cosine function is 1 .
(xi) In unit circle $\cos \theta$ is equal to the $x$-coordinate of the given point.

# 11.4.4 Graph of $y=\tan x$ from $-\pi$ to $\pi$

We know that $\tan (-x)=-\tan x$ and $\tan (\pi-x)=-\tan x$, so the values of $\tan x$ for $x=0^{\circ}, 30^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}$ can help us in making the table.
Also, we know that $\tan x$ is undefined at $x= \pm 90^{\circ}$, when
(i) $x$ approaches $\frac{\pi}{2}$ from left $x \rightarrow\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{-}$, $\tan x$ decreases indefinitely in Quard I.
(ii) $x$ approaches $\frac{\pi}{2}$ from right i.e., $x \rightarrow\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{+}$, $\tan x$ decreases indefinitely in Quard IV.
(iii) $x$ approaches $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ from left i.e., $x \rightarrow\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{-}$, $\tan x$ increases indefinitely in Quard II.
(iv) $x$ approaches $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ from right i.e., $x \rightarrow\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{+}$, $\tan x$ decreases indefinitely in Quard III.
We know that the period of tangent is $\pi$, so we shall first draw the graph for the interval from 0 to $\pi$ (from $0^{\circ}$ to $180^{\circ}$ ).
$\therefore \quad$ The table of ordered pairs satisfying $y=\tan x$ is given below:

| $x$ | 0 | $\frac{\pi}{6}$ | $\frac{\pi}{3}$ | $\frac{\pi}{2}-0$ | $\frac{\pi}{2}+0$ | $\frac{2 \pi}{3}$ | $\frac{5 \pi}{6}$ | $\pi$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | or | or | or | or | or | or | or | or |
|  | 0 | $30^{\circ}$ | $60^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}-0$ | $90^{\circ}+0$ | $120^{\circ}$ | $150^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ |
| $\tan x$ | 0 | 0.58 | 1.73 | $+\infty$ | $-\infty$ | $-1.73$ | $-0.58$ | 0 |

Since the period of $\tan x$ is $\pi$, so we have the following graph of $y=\tan x$ from $-360^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$.
Properties of graph of tangent function ( $y=\tan x$ )
(i) The domain is the set of real numbers except the values where function is undefined domain of $\tan x=(-\infty, \infty), x \neq(2 n+1) \frac{\pi}{2}$, where $n \in Z$
(ii) The range includes all real numbers $(-\infty, \infty)$
(iii) The graph of $\tan x$ is not continuous for all real numbers. It breaks at $x=(2 n+1) \frac{\pi}{2}$, where $n \in Z$
(iv) The period of tan function is $\pi$. Mathematically, we can express it as $\tan (\theta+\pi)=\tan \theta$
(v) The tan function is an odd function, as the graph of tan function is symmetric about the origin. Mathematically, it can be written as $\tan (-\theta)=-\tan \theta$
(vi) The $x$-intercepts of the tangent function occurs at $x=\pi n$, where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
(vii) The $y$-intercept of the tangent function is 0
(viii) The amplitude of tangent function is undefined because it has no maximum or minimum values.
