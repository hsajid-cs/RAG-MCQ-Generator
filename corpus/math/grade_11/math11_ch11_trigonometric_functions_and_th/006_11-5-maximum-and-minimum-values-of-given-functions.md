### 11.5 Maximum and Minimum Values of Given Functions of the Type

- $a+b \sin \theta$
- $a+b \cos \theta$
- $a+b \sin (c \theta+d)$
- $a+b \cos (c \theta+d)$
- The reciprocals of the above, where $a, b, c$ and $d$ are real numbers.

The trigonometric functions like sine and cosine are periodic function because the values of these function repeat over regular intervals. These functions are fundamental in mathematics because of the repetition of their values at definite cycles and are used to model various real-life situations, such as radio waves, light wave, and alternating current in electricity and are also known as a specific case of sinusoidal functions.
The functions of the form $f(\theta)=a+b \sin \theta, g(\theta)=a+b \cos \theta, f_{1}(\theta)=a+b \sin (c \theta+d)$ and $g_{1}(\theta)=a+b \cos (c \theta+d)$ are the types of sinusoidal functions.
Now consider the general form of sinusoidal function $f_{1}(\theta)=a+b \sin (c \theta+d) \ldots$ (i) here ' $a$ ' represent the vertical shift refers to the vertical translation of the graph of the function, achieved by shifting the entire graph upward or downward. This shift, also known as the vertical displacement, moves the function's position along the $y$-axis without altering its shape or period. Amplitude $|b|$ is the maximum height of a wave

measured from its midline. The period of (i) is equal to $\frac{2 \pi}{c}$. Phase shift ' $d$ ' indicates the horizontal translation of the graph of the function, determining how far the wave is shifted left or right along the $x$-axis. A positive $d$ shifts the graph to the left, while a negative $d$ shifts it to the right, altering the starting point of the wave without changing its shape or period.
For Example, consider the function $f(0)=1+3 \sin (2 \theta)$. Here $a=1$ is vertical shift, amplitude $=|b|=|3|=3$ and period $=\frac{2 \pi}{2}=\pi$ as shown in the adjacent figure.
Now, finding the maximum and minimum values of the functions $f(\theta)=a+b \sin (c \theta+d)$ and $g(\theta)=a+b \cos (c \theta+d)$ is not a difficult task. We know that the maximum absolute values of sine and cosine are equal to 1 , so the maximum value of the product $b \sin \theta$ is $|b|$.
Thus, the maximum value of $f(0)$ or $g(\theta)$ is : $M=a+|b|$, whenever $\sin \theta=1$ or $\cos \theta=1$ where $M$ denotes the maximum value of the function.
The minimum value of $f(0)$ or $g(\theta)$ function is $m=a-|b|$, whenever $\sin \theta=-1$ or $\cos \theta=-1$ and $m$ denotes the minimum value of the function.

Note
The absolute value of $b$ is called the Amplitude of $f(\theta)=a+b \sin \theta$. The value of the amplitude can also be determined using the formula

$$
\text { Amplitude }=\frac{\text { Maximum value }- \text { Minimum value }}{2}
$$

Example 2 Find the maximum and minimum values of the following functions:
(i) $2+3 \sin x$
(ii) $5-2 \cos 3 x$
(iii) reciprocal of (ii)

Solution (i) Let $f(x)=2+3 \sin x$
The maximum value of $f(x)$ will occur when $\sin x=1$. Here $a=2$ and $b=3$,
Maximum value of the function: $M=a+|b|=2+3=5$
The minimum value of the function will occur when $\sin x=-1$.
Minimum value of the function: $m=a-|b|=2-3=-1$
Thus, maximum value of the function is 5 and the minimum value is -1

(ii) Let $f(x)=5-2 \cos 3 x$

The maximum value of $f(x)$ will occur when $\cos 3 x=1$. Here $a=5$ and $b=-2$,
Maximum value of the function: $M=a+|b|=5+|-2|=5+2=7$.
The minimum value of the function will occurs when $\cos 3 x=-1$.
Minimum value of the function: $m=a-|b|=5-|-2|=5-2=3$.
Thus, maximum value of the function is 7 and the minimum value is 3 .
(iii) reciprocal of part (ii)

The reciprocal of $5-2 \cos 3 x$ is $\frac{1}{5-2 \cos 3 x}$
Let $g(x)=\frac{1}{5-2 \cos 3 x}$
To find the maximum and minimum values of $g(x)$, first we will find the maximum and minimum values of $5-2 \cos 3 x$, which are 7 and 3 respectively.
After finding the maximum and minimum values take their reciprocal. The reciprocal of the maximum value is the minimum of $g(x)$ and the reoprocal of the
minimum value is the maximum of $g(x)$
Maximum value of $g(x)=\frac{1}{m}=\frac{1}{3}=0.33$
Minimum value of $g(x)=\frac{1}{M}=\frac{1}{7}=0.14$

# 11.5.1 Real World Applications

## Ferris Wheel Problems

The first Ferris wheel was invented by George W. Ferris. He built the first one for 1893 World'a Fair. A Ferris wheel is an important example of periodic motion that can be described using trigonometric functions, specifically sinusoidal functions. When we model the height of a rider on a Ferris wheel over time, we can use these functions to capture the periodic nature of the motion. The motion of Ferris wheel can be modeled by $f(t)=a+b \sin (c t+d)$ or $f(t)=a+b \cos (c t+d)$.
Example 3 A Ferris wheel with a radius of 45 feet has its lowest point located 5 feet above the ground. It completes one full revolution every 60 seconds in counter clock wise direction. Model an equation that describes the height of a rider on the Ferris wheel as a function of time $t$. How high is the rider from the ground after 40 seconds?. Also graph the model equation. Solution Since it takes 60 seconds for the Ferris wheel to complete one full revolution

(one cycle), which is the period of the Ferris wheel, that is period $=60$

$$
\frac{2 \pi}{c}=60 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c=\frac{2 \pi}{60} \quad \Rightarrow \quad c=\frac{\pi}{30}
$$

The amplitude $b$ which is equal to the radius of a ferris wheel (in this case $b=45$ ).
The vertical shift $a$ is the height of the center of the Ferris wheel above the ground. Since the lowest point is 5 feet above the ground, so $a=5+b=5+45=50$.
we can model the height of a rider using (sine or cosine), because it reflects the periodic nature of the motion. We usually choose a cosine function if the rider starts at the maximum or minimum height, or a sine function if the rider starts at the midpoint.
Since the rider starts at the lowest point and goes up, we can easily model the required equation as a negative cosine function so,
$h(t)=-b \cos (c t)+a$, where $t$ is time and $h$ is height.
Now substituting the above values we get the function $h(t)=-45 \cos \left(\frac{\pi}{30} t\right)+50$,
which is the required equation of Ferris wheel.
Next, we find the height of the rider at $t=40$ seconds.

$$
h(t)=-45 \cos \left(\frac{\pi}{30} t\right)+50
$$

For $\quad t=40$, we have

$$
h(40)=-45 \cos \left(\frac{\pi}{30}, 40\right)+50=72.5 \text { feet }
$$

Thus, height of rider after 40 second is 72.5 feet.
The graph of the model equation is shown below.
Example 4 The water level L (in feet) of a tidal river varies throughout the day. Suppose the level of the tidal river can be modeled by the equation: $L(t)=8+4 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{6} t\right)$, where $t$ denotes the time (in hours). The water level oscillates 4 feet above and below an average level of 8 feet.
(a) Find the water level at $t=3$ hours?
(b) What is the minimum water level?

Solution (a) Given equation of water level: $L(t)=8+4 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{6} t\right)$
To find the water level, substitute $t=3$ into the equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
& L(3)=8+4 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{6} \cdot 3\right)=8+4 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \\
& L(3)=8+4(1)=12
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, water level at $t=3$ hours is 12 feet.
(b) Now, to find the minimum water level, we need to determine when the sine function attains its minimum value. We know that the minimum value of $\sin t=-1$, substitute the $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{6} t\right)=-1$ into the equation

$$
L(t)=8+4 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{6} t\right)=8+4(-1)=8-4=4
$$

Thus, minimum water level of the tidal river is 4 feet.
Example 5 From a point 100 m above the surface of a lake, the angle of elevation of a peak of a cliff is found to be $15^{\circ}$ and the angle of depression of the image of the peak is $30^{\circ}$. Find the height of the peak.
Solution Let $A$ be the top of the peak $\overline{A M}$ and $\overline{M B}$ be its image. Let $P$ be the point of observation and $L$ be the point just below $P$ (on the surface of the lake).
From $P$, draw $\overline{P Q} \perp \overline{A M}$.
Let $m \overline{P Q}=y$ metres and $m \overline{A M}=h$ metres.
$\therefore \quad m \overline{A Q}=h-m \overline{Q M}=h-m \overline{P L}=h-100$
From the figure,

$$
\tan 15^{\circ}=\frac{A Q}{P Q}=\frac{h-100}{y} \text { and } \tan 30^{\circ}=\frac{B Q}{P Q}=\frac{100+h}{y}
$$

By division, we get

$$
\frac{\tan 15^{\circ}}{\tan 30^{\circ}}=\frac{h-100}{h+100}
$$

By Componendo and Dividendo, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\tan 15^{\circ}+\tan 30^{\circ}}{\tan 15^{\circ}-\tan 30^{\circ}}=\frac{h-100+h+100}{h-100-h-100}=\frac{2 h}{-200}=\frac{h}{-100} \\
& \therefore \quad h=\frac{\tan 30^{\circ}+\tan 15^{\circ}}{\tan 30^{\circ}-\tan 15^{\circ}} \times 100=[\begin{array}{c}
0.5774+0.2679 \\
0.5774-0.2679
\end{array}] \times 100 \\
& \Rightarrow h=273.1179
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence height of the peak $=273 \mathrm{~m}$. (approximately)
