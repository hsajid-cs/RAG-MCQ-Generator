### 12.3.1 Notation of Derivative

Several notations are used for derivatives. We have used the functional symbol $f^{\prime}(x)$, for the derivative of $f$ at $x$. For the function $y=f(x)$.

$$
y+\delta y=f(x+\delta x)
$$

Dividing both the sides of (iv) by $\delta x$, we get

$$
\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=\frac{f(x+\delta x)-f(x)}{\delta x}
$$

Taking limit of both the sides of (v) as $\delta x \rightarrow 0$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \lim _{\delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=\lim _{\delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+\delta x)-f(x)}{\delta x} \\
& \lim _{\delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\delta y}{\delta x} \text { is denoted by } \frac{d y}{d x}, \text { so (vi) is written as } \frac{d y}{d x}=f^{\prime}(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

# Note

The symbol $\frac{d y}{d x}$ is used for the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ and here it is not a quotient of $d y$ and $d x . \frac{d y}{d x}$ is also denoted by $y^{\prime}$.

Now we write, in a table the notations for derivative of $y=f(x)$ used by different mathematicians:

| Name of mathematician | Leibniz | Newton | Lagrange | Euler |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Notation used for derivative | $\frac{d y}{d x}$ or $\frac{d f}{d x}$ | $f^{\prime \prime}(x)$ or $y^{\prime \prime}$ | $f^{\prime}(x)$ | $D f(x)$ |

If we replace $x+\delta x$ by $x$ and $x$ by $a$, then the expression $f(x+\delta x)-f(x)$ becomes $f(x)-f(a)$ and the change $\delta x$ in the independent variable, in this case, is $x-a$.
So, the expression $\frac{f(x+\delta x)-f(x)}{\delta x}$ is written as $\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$
Taking the limit of the expression (vii) when $x \rightarrow a$, gives $\operatorname{Lim}_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=f^{\prime}(a)$.
Here $f^{\prime}(a)$ is called the derivative or gradient of $f$ at $x=a$.
