### 7.1.6 Properties of Magnitude of a Vector

Let **v** be a vector in the plane or in space and let **c** be a real number, then

(i) **v** ≥ 0, and **v** = 0 if and only if **v** = 0

(ii) **cv** = |**c**| **v**|

**Proof:** (i) We write vector **v** in component form as **v** = [**x, y**], then

$$
|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \geq 0 \text{ for all } x \text{ and } y.
$$

Further **v** = √(x^2 + y^2) = 0 if and only if **x** = 0, **y** = 0

In this case **v** = [0, 0] = 0

(ii) **cv** = |**cx, cy**| = √(cx)^2 + (cy)^2 = √(cx)^2 √(x^2 + y^2) = |**c**| **v**|
