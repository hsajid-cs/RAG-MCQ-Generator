### **7.1.5 Vectors in a Plane**

Let *R* be the set of real numbers. The Cartesian plane is defined to be the *R*<sup>2</sup> = {(*x*, *y*) : *x*, *y* ∈ *R*}.

An element (*x*, *y*) ∈ *R*<sup>2</sup> represents a point *P*(*x*, *y*) which is uniquely determined by its coordinate *x* and *y*. Given a vector *u* in the plane, there exists a unique point *P*(*x*, *y*) in the plane such that the vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$ is equal to *u* (see figure). So we can use rectangular coordinates (*x*, *y*) for *P* to associate a unique ordered pair [*x*, *y*] to vector *u*.

We define addition and scalar multiplication in *R*<sup>2</sup> by:

- **(i) Addition:** For any two vectors $\underline{u} = [x, y]$ and $\underline{v} = [x', y']$, we have
  $$
  \underline{u} + \underline{v} = [x, y] + [x', y'] = [x + x', y + y']
  $$

- **(ii) Scalar Multiplication:** For $\underline{u} = [x, y]$ and $\alpha \in R$, we have
  $$
  \alpha \underline{u} = \alpha [x, y] = [\alpha x, \alpha y]
  $$

**Definition:** The set of all ordered pairs [*x*, *y*] of real numbers, together with the rules of addition and scalar multiplication, is called the set of **vectors** in *R*<sup>2</sup>.

*version: 1.1*

For the vector **u** = [**x, y**], **x** and **y** are called the components of **u**.

**Note:** The vector [**x, y**] is an ordered pair of numbers, not a point (**x, y**) in the plane.
