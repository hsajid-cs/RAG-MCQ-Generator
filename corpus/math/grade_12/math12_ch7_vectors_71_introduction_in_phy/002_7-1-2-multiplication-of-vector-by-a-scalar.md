### 7.1.2 Multiplication of Vector by a Scalar

We use the word scalar to mean a real number. Multiplication of a vector $$\underline{v}$$ by a scalar $$k$$ is a vector whose magnitude is $$k$$ times that of $$\underline{v}$$. It is denoted by $$k \underline{v}$$.

- (i) If $$k$$ is $$\rightarrow$$ve, then $$\underline{v}$$ and $$k \underline{v}$$ are in the same direction.
- (ii) If $$k$$ is $$\rightarrow$$ve, then $$\underline{v}$$ and $$k \underline{v}$$ are in the opposite direction.
