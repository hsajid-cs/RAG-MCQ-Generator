### **(ii) Parallelogram Law of Addition**

If two vectors *u* and *v* are represented by two adjacent sides *AB* and *AC* of a parallelogram as shown in the figure, then diagonal *AD* gives the sum or resultant of $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{AC}$, that is

$$
\overrightarrow{AD} = \overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{AC} = \underline{u} + \underline{v}
$$
