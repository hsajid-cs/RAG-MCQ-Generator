### **7.1.4 Position Vector**

The vector, whose initial point is the origin *O* and whose terminal point is *P*, is called the position vector of the point *P* and is written as $\overrightarrow{OP}$.

The position vectors of the points *A* and *B* relative to the origin *O* are defined by $\overrightarrow{OA} = \underline{o}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} = \underline{b}$ respectively. In the figure, by triangle law of addition,

$$
\overrightarrow{OA} + \overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{OB}
$$

$$
\underline{o} + \overrightarrow{AB} = \underline{b}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \overrightarrow{AB} = \underline{b} \quad \underline{o}
$$
