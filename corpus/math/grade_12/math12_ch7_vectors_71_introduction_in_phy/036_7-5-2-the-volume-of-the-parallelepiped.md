### 7.5.2 The Volume of the Parallelepiped

The triple scalar product $(u \times \gamma), \psi$ represents the volume of the parallelepiped having $u, \gamma$ and $\psi$ as its conterminous edges.

As it is seen from the formula that:

$$
(\underline{u} \times \underline{v}) \cdot \underline{w}=[\underline{u} \times \underline{v}] \mid \underline{v} \mid \cos \theta
$$

Hence (i) $|\underline{u} \times \underline{v}|=$ area of the parallelogram with two adjacent sides, $\underline{u}$ and $\gamma$.
(ii) $|\underline{v}| \cos \theta=$ height of the parallelepiped
$(\underline{u} \times \underline{v}) \cdot \underline{w}=[\underline{u} \times \underline{v}] \mid \underline{v} \mid \cos \theta=($ Area of parallelogram $)($ height $)$
Volume of the parallelepiped
Similarly, by taking the base plane formed by $\gamma$ and $\psi$, we have
The volume of the parallelepiped $=(\gamma \times \psi), u$
And by taking the base plane formed by $\psi$ and $\underline{u}$, we have
The volume of the parallelepiped $=(\psi \times \underline{u}), \gamma$
So, we have: $(\underline{u} \times \gamma) \cdot \underline{w}=(\gamma \times \psi) \cdot \underline{u}=(\psi \times \underline{u}), \gamma$
