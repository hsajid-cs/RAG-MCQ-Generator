#### (i) Triangle Law of Addition

If two vectors *u* and *v* are represented by the two sides *AB* and *BC* of a triangle such that the terminal point of *u* coincide with the initial point of *v*, then the third side *AC* of the triangle gives vector sum *u* + *v*, that is

$$
\overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{BC} = \overrightarrow{AC} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \underline{u} + \underline{v} = \overrightarrow{AC}
$$
