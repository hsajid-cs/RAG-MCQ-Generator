### **(b) Subtraction of two vectors**

The difference of two vectors $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{AC}$ is defined by

$$
\overrightarrow{AB} - \overrightarrow{AC} = \overrightarrow{AB} + (- \overrightarrow{AC})
$$

$$
\underline{u} - \underline{v} = \underline{u} + (- \underline{v})
$$

In figure, this difference is interpreted as the main diagonal of the parallelogram with sides $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $-\overrightarrow{AC}$. We can also interpret the same vector difference as the third side of a triangle with sides $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{AC}$. In this second interpretation, the vector difference $\overrightarrow{AB} - \overrightarrow{AC} = \overrightarrow{CB}$ points the terminal point of the vector from which we are subtracting the second vector.
