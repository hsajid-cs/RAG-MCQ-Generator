### (e) Position Vector

For any point **P(x, y)** in **R²**, a vector **u** = [**x, y**] is represented by a directed line segment **OP**, whose initial point is at origin. Such vectors are called position vectors because they provide a unique correspondence between the points (positions) and vectors.
