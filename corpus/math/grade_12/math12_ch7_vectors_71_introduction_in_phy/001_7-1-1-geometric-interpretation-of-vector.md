### 7.1.1 Geometric Interpretation of Vector

Geometrically, a vector is represented by a directed line segment $$A B$$ with $$A$$ its initial point and $$B$$ its terminal point. It is often found convenient to denote a vector by an arrow and is written either as $$A B$$ or as a boldface symbol like $$v$$ or in underlined form $$\underline{v}$$.

- (i) The magnitude or length or norm of a vector $$A B$$ or $$\underline{v}$$ is its absolute value and is written as $$A B$$ or simply $$A B$$ or $$\mid \underline{v}$$.
- (ii) A unit vector is defined as a vector whose magnitude is unity. Unit vector of vector $$\underline{v}$$ is written as $$\underline{v}$$ (read as $$\underline{v}$$ hat) and is defined by $$\underline{v} = \frac{\underline{v}}{\mid \underline{v}}$$.

- (iii) If terminal point $$B$$ of a vector $$A B$$ coincides with its initial point $$A$$, then magnitude $$A B = 0$$ and $$A B = 0$$, which is called zero or null vector.
- (iv) Two vectors are said to be negative of each other if they have same magnitude but opposite direction.

If $$A B = \underline{v}, \quad \text{then} \quad B A = -AB = -\underline{v}$$

and $$B A = -AB$$
