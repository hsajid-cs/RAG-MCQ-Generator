### 7.4 THE CROSS PRODUCT OR VECTOR PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS

The vector product of two vectors is widely used in Physics, particularly, Mechanics and Electricity. It is only defined for vectors in space.

Let $\mu$ and $\gamma$ be two non-zero vectors. The cross or vector product of $\mu$ and $\gamma$, written as $\mu \times \gamma$, is defined by

## Right hand rule

(i) If the fingers of the right hand point along the vector $\underline{\mu}$ and then curl towards the vector $\gamma$, then the thumb will give the direction of $\underline{\hat{\eta}}$ which is $\underline{\mu} \times \gamma$. It is shown in the figure (a).
(ii) In figure (b), the right hand rule shows the direction of $\gamma \times \mu$.
