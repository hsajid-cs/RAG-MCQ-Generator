#### Solution.

The graph of the line x – 2y = 6 is drawn by joining the point (6, 0) and (0, –3). The point (0, 0) satisfies the inequality x – 2y < 6 because 0 – 2(0) = 0 < 6. Thus the graph of x – 2y ≤ 6 is the upper half-plane including the graph of the line x – 2y = 6. The closed half-plane is partially shown by shading in figure 5.31(a).
