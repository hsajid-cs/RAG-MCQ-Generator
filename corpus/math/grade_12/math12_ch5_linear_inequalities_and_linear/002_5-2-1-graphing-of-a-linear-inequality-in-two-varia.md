### 5.2.1 Graphing of A Linear Inequality in Two Variables

Generally a linear inequality in two variables $x$ and $y$ can be one of the following forms: $a x+b y<c ; \quad a x+b y>c ; \quad a x+b y \leq c ; \quad a x+b y \geq c$
where $a, b, c$ are constants and $a, b$ are not both zero.
We know that the graph of linear equation of the form
$a x+b y=c$ is a line which divides the plane into two disjoint regions as stated below:
(1) The set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ such that $a x+b y<c$
(2) The set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ such that $a x+b y>c$

The regions (1) and (2) are called half planes and the line $a x+b y=c$ is called the boundary of each half plane.

Note that a vertical line divides the plane into left and right half planes while a nonvertical line divides the plane into upper and lower half planes.

A solution of a linear inequality in $x$ and $y$ is an ordered pair of numbers which satisfies the inequality.

For example, the ordered pair $(1,1)$ is a solution of the inequality $x+2 y<6$ because $1+2(1)=3<6$ which is true.

There are infinitely many ordered pairs that satisfy the inequality $x+2 y<6$, so its graph will be a half plane.

Note that the linear equation $a x+b y=c$ is called "associated or corresponding equation" of each of the above mentioned inequalities.

## Procedure for Graphing a linear Inequality in two Variables

(i) The corresponding equation of the inequality is first graphed by using 'dashes' if the inequality involves the symbols $>$ or $<$ and a solid line is drawn if the inequality involves the symbols $\geq$ or $\leq$.
(ii) A test point (not on the graph of the corresponding equation) is chosen which determines that the half plane is on which side of the boundary line.

Example 1. Graph the inequality *x* + 2*y* < 6.

Solution. The associated equation of the inequality

$$x + 2y < 6 \quad \text{(i)}$$

is

$$x + 2y = 6 \quad \text{(ii)}$$

The line (ii) intersects the *x*-axis and *y*-axis at (6, 0) and (0, 3) respectively. As no point of the line (ii) is a solution *x* of the inequality (i), so the graph of the line (ii) is shown by using dashes. We take *O*(0, 0) as a test point because it is not on the line (ii).

Substituting *x* = 0, *y* = 0 in the expression *x* + 2*y* gives 0 – 2(0) = 0 < 6, so the point (0, 0) satisfies the inequality (i).

Any other point below the line (ii) satisfies the inequality (i), that is all points in the half plane containing the point (0, 0) satisfy the inequality (i).

Thus the graph of the solution set of inequality (i) is the a region on the origin-side of the line (ii), that is, the region below the line (ii). A portion of the open halfplane below the line (ii) is shown as shaded region in figure 5.22(a).

All points above the dashed line satisfy the inequality *x* + 2*y* > 6 (iii).

A portion of the open half plane above the line (ii) is shown by shading in figure 5.22(b).

Note: 1. The graph of the inequality *x* + 2*y* ≤ 6 ..(iv) includes the graph of the line (ii), so the open half-plane below the line (ii) including the graph of the line (ii) is the graph of the inequality (iv). A portion of the graph of the inequality (iv) is shown by shading in figure 5.22(c).

Note: 2. All points on the line (ii) and above the line (ii) satisfy the inequality *x* + 2*y* ≥ 6 .... (v). This means that the solution set of the inequality (v) consists of all points above the line (ii) and all points on the lines (ii). The graph of the inequality (v) is partially shown as shaded region in figure 5.22(d).

Note: 3. that the graphs of *x* + 2*y* ≤ 6 and *x* + 2*y* ≥ 6 are closed half planes.

Example 2. Graph the following linear inequalities in *xy*-plane;

(i) 2*x* ≥ –3 (ii) *y* ≤ 2

Solution. The inequality (i) in *xy*-plane is considered as 2*x* + 0*y* ≥ –3 and its solution set consists of all points (*x*, *y*) such that *x*, *y* ∈ *R* and *x* ≥ –3/2.

The corresponding equation of the inequality (i) is 2*x* = –3 (1) which a vertical line (parallel to the *y*-axis) and its graph is drawn in figure 5.23(a).

The graph of the inequality 2*x* > –3 is the open half plane to the right of the line (1).

Thus the graph of 2*x* ≥ –3 is the closed half-plane to the right of the line (1).

(ii) The associated equation of the inequality (ii) is *y* = 2 (2) which is a horizontal line (parallel to the *x*-axis) and its graph is shown in figure 5.23(b). Here the solution set of the inequality *y* < 2 is the open half plane below the boundary line *y* = 2. Thus the graph of *y* ≤ 2 consists of the boundary line and the open half plane below it.

Note that the intersection of graphs of 2x ≥ –3 and y ≤ 2 is partially shown in the adjoining figure 5.23(c).
