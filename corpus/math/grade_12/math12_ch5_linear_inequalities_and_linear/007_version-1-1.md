We draw the graph of the line 2x + y = 2 joining the points (1, 0) and (0, 2). The point (0, 0) does not satisfy the inequality 2x + y > 2 because 2(0) + 0 = 0 ≠ 2. Thus the graph of the inequality 2x + y ≥ 2 is the closed half-plane not on the origin-side of the line 2x + y = 2.

Thus the closed half-plane is shown partially as a shaded region in figure 5.31(b). The solution region of the given system of inequalities is the intersection of the graphs indicated in figures 5.31(a) and 5.31(b) and is shown as shaded region in figure 5.31(c).

The intersection point (2, – 2) can be found by solving the equations x – 2y = 6 and 2x + y = 2.

Note that the line x – 2y = 6 and 2x + y = 2 divide the xy-plane into four regions bounded by these lines. These four (bounded) regions are displayed in the adjoining figure.

Example 2. Graph the solution region for the following system of inequalities:

$$x - 2y \leq 6, \quad 2x + y > 2, \quad x + 2y \geq 10$$

Solution: The graph of the inequalities $x-2 y \leq 6$ and $2 x+y \geq 2$ have already drawn in figure 5.31(a) and 5.31(b) and their intersection is partially shown as a shaded region in figure 5.31(c) of the example 1 Art (5.3). Following the procedure of the example 1 of Art (5.3) the graph of the inequality $x+2 y \leq 10$ is shown partially in the figure 5.32(a).

The intersection of three graphs is the required solution region which is the shaded triangular region $P Q R$ (including its sides) shown partially in the figure 5.32(b).

Now we define a corner point of a solution region.

## DEFINITION:

A point of a solution region where two of its boundary lines intersect, is called a corner point or vertex of the solution region.

Such points play a useful role while solving linear programming problems. In example 2, the following three corner points are obtained by corresponding equations (of linear inequalities) given in the example 2(a) pairs.

|  Corresponding lines of inequalities: | Corner Points  |
| --- | --- |
|  $x-2 y=6, \quad 2 x+y=2$ | $P(2,-2)$  |
|  $x-2 y=6, \quad x+2 y=10$ | $Q(8,1)$  |
|  $2 x+y=2, \quad x+2 y=10$ | $R(-2,6)$  |

Example 3. Graph the following systems of inequalities.

|  (i) | $2 x+y \geq 2$ | (ii) | $2 x+y \geq 2$ | (iii) | $2 x+y \geq 2$  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | $x+2 y \leq 10$ |  | $x+2 y \leq 10$ |  | $x+2 y \leq 10$  |
|   | $y \geq 0$ |  | $x \geq 0$ |  | $x \geq 0, y \geq 0$  |

## Solution:

(i) The corresponding equations of the inequalities

$$ \begin{array}{llll} 2 x+y \geq 2 & \text { and } & x+2 y \leq 10 & \text { are } \ 2 x+y=2 & \text { (I) and } & x+2 y=10 & \text { (II) } \end{array} $$

For the partial graph of $2 x+y \geq 2$ see figure 5.31(b) of the example 1 and the graph of the inequality $x+2 y \leq 10$ is partially shown in figure 5.32(a) of the example 2.

The solution region of the inequalities $2 x+y \geq 2$ and $x+2 y \leq 10$ is the intersection of their individual graphs. The common region of the graphs of inequalities is partially shown as a shaded region in $x^{2}$ figure 5.33(a).

The graph of $y \geq 0$ is the upper half plane including the graph of the corresponding line $y=0$ (the $x$-axis) of the linear inequality $y \geq 0$. The graph of $y \geq 0$ is partially displayed in figure 5.33(b).

The solution region of the system of inequalities in (i) is the intersection of the graphs shown in figure 5.33(a) and 5.33(b). This solution region is displayed in figure 5.33(c).

(ii) See figure 5.33(a) for the graphs of the inequalities 2*x* + *y* ≥ 2 and *x* + 2*y* ≤ 10.

The graph of *x* ≥ 0 consists of the open half-plane to the right of the corresponding line *x* = 0 (*y*-axis) of the inequality *x* ≥ 0 and its graph. See figure 5.34(a).

Thus the solution region of the inequalities in (ii) is partially shown in figure 5.34(b). This region is the intersection of graphs in figure 5.33(a) and 5.34(a).
