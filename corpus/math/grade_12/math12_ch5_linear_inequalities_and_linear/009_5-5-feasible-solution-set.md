### 5.5 Feasible solution set

We see that solution region of the inequalities in example 2 of Art 5.3 is not within the first quadrant. If the nonnegative constraints $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$ are included with the system of inequalities given in the example 2, then the solution region is restricted to the first quadrant.

It is the polygonal region $A B C D E$ (including its sides) as shown in the figure 5.51.

Such a region (which is restricted to the first quadrant) is referred to as a feasible region for the set of given constraints. Each point of the feasible region is called a feasible solution of the system of linear inequalities (or for the set of a given constraints). A set consisting of all the feasible solutions of the system of linear inequalities is called a feasible solution set.

Example 1. Graph the feasible region and find the corner points for the following system of inequalities (or subject to the following constraints).

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x-y \leq 3 \\
& x+2 y \leq 6 \\
& x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Solution: The associated equations for the inequalities

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x-y \leq 3 \quad \text { (i) } \quad \text { and } x+2 y \leq 6 \quad \text { (ii) } \\
& \text { are } x-y=3 \quad \text { (1) and } x+2 y=6 \quad(2)
\end{aligned}
$$

As the point $(3,0)$ and $(0,-3)$ are on the line (1), so the graph of $x-y=3$ is drawn by joining the points $(3,0)$ and $(0,-3)$ by solid line.

Similarly line (2) is graphed by joining the points $(6,0)$ and $(0,3)$ by solid line. For $x=0$ and $y=0$, we have;

$$
0-0=0 \leq 3 \text { and } 0+2(0)=0 \leq 6
$$

so both the closed half-planes are on the origin sides of the lines (1) and (2). The intersection of these closed half-planes is partially displayed as shaded region in figure 5.52(a).

For the graph of *y* ≥ 0, see figure 5.33(b) of the example 3 of art 5.3.

The intersection of graphs shown in figures 5.52(a) and 5.33(b) is partially graphed as shaded region in figure 5.52(b).

The graph of *x* ≥ 0 is drawn in figure 5.34(a). The intersection of the graphs shown in figures 5.52(a) and 5.34(a) is graphed in figure 5.52(c).

Finally the graph of the given system of linear inequalities is displayed in figure 5.52(d) which is the feasible region for the given system of linear inequalities. The points (0, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1) and (0, 3) are corner points of the feasible region.

**Example 2.** A manufacturer wants to make two types of concrete. Each bag of Agrade concrete contains 8 kilograms of gravel (small pebbles with coarse sand) and 4 kilograms of cement while each bag of B-grade concrete contains 12 kilograms of gravel and two kilograms of cement. If there are 1920 kilograms of gravel and 480 kilograms of cement, then graph the feasible region under the given restrictions and find corner points of the feasible region.

**Solution:** Let *x* be the number of bags of A-grade concrete produced and *y* denote the number of bags of B-grade concrete produced, then 8*x* kilograms of gravel will be used for A-grade concrete and 12*y* kilograms of gravel will be required for B-grade concrete so 8*x* + 12*y* should not exceed 1920, that is,

$$8x + 12y \leq 1920$$

Similarly, the linear constraint for cement will be

$$4x + 2y \leq 480$$

Now we have to graph the feasible region for the linear constraints

$$8x + 12y \leq 1920$$
$$4x + 2y \leq 480, \quad x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0$$

Taking the one unit along *x*-axis and *y*-axis equal to 40 we draw the graph of the feasible region required.

The shaded region of figure 5.53(a) shows the graph of 8*x* + 12*y* ≤ 1920 including the nonnegative constraints *x* ≥ 0 and *y* ≥ 0.

In the figure 5.53(b), the graph of 4*x* + 2*y* ≤ 480 including the non-negative constraints *x* ≥ 0 and *y* ≥ 0 is displayed as shaded region.

The intersection of these two graphs is shown as shaded region in figure 5.53(c), which is the feasible region for the given linear constraints.

The point (0, 0), (120, 0), (60, 120) and (0, 160) are the corner points of the feasible region.

**Example 3. Graph the feasible regions subject to the following constraints.**

(a) $$2x - 3y \leq 6$$
(b) $$2x - 3y \leq 6$$
$$2x + y \geq 2$$
$$2x + y \geq 2$$
$$x \geq 0, y \geq 0$$

$$2x + y \geq 2$$

$$x + 2y < 8, \quad x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0$$

**Solution:** The graph of $$2x - 3y \leq 6$$ is the closed half-plane on the origin side of $$2x - 3y = 6$$. The portion of the graph of system $$2x - 3y \leq 6$$,

$$x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0$$

is shown as shaded region in figure 5.54(a).

*version: 1.1*

The graph of $$2x + y \geq 2$$ is the closed half-plane not on the origin side of $$2x + y = 2$$. The portion of the graph of the system $$2x + y \geq 2$$,

$$x \geq 0, y \geq 0$$

is displayed as shaded region in figure 5.54(b).

The graph of the system

$$2x - 3y \leq 6, \quad 2x + y \leq 2,$$
$$x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0$$

is the intersection of the graphs shown in figures 5.54(a) and 5.54(b) and it is partially displayed in figure 5.54(c) as shaded region.

(b) The graph of system $$x + 2y \leq 8, \quad x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0$$ is a triangular region indicated in figure 5.45(d).

Thus the graph of the system

$$2x - 3y \leq 6$$
$$2x + y \geq 2$$
$$x + 2y \leq 8$$
$$x \geq 0, y \geq 0$$

is the intersection of the graphs shown in figures 5.54(c) and 5.54(d). It is the shaded region indicated in the figure 5.54(e).

**Note:** The corner points of feasible region the set of constraints in (a) are (1, 0), (3, 0) and (0, 2) while the corner points of the feasible region for the set of constraints in (b) are (1, 0):

$$(3, 0) \left( \frac{16}{7} \cdot \frac{10}{7} \right), (0, 4) \text{ and } (0, 2)$$

We see that the feasible solution regions in example 3(a) and 3(b) are of different types. The feasible region in example 3(a) is unbounded as it cannot be enclosed in any circle how large it may be while the feasible region in example 3(b) can easily be enclosed within a circle, so it is bounded. If the line segment obtained by joining any two points of a region lies entirely within the region, then the region is called **convex**.

Both the feasible regions of example 3(a) and 3(b) are convex but the regions such as shown in the adjoining figures are not convex.
