### 5.2 LINEAR INEQUALITIES

Inequalities are expressed by the following four symbols;
$>$ (greater than); < (less than); $\geq$ (greater than or equal to); $\leq$ (less than or equal to)
For example (i) $a x<b$ (ii) $a x+b \geq c$ (iii) $a x+b y>c$ (iv) $a x+b y \leq c$ are inequalities. Inequalities (i) and (ii) are in one variable while inequalities (iii) and (iv) are in two variables.

The following operations will not affect the order (or sense) of inequality while changing it to simpler equivalent form:
(i) Adding or subtracting a constant to each side of it.
(ii) Multiplying or dividing each side of it by a positive constant.

Note that the order (or sense) of an inequality is changed by multiplying or dividing its each side by a negative constant.

Now for revision we consider inequality, $x<\frac{3}{2}$
All real numbers $<\frac{3}{2}$ are in the solution set of (A).
Thus the interval $\left(-\infty, \frac{3}{2}\right)$ or $-\infty<x<\frac{3}{2}$ is the solution set of the
inequality (A) which is shown in the figure 5.21

$$
-5 \quad-4 \quad-3 \quad-2 \quad-1 \quad 0 \quad 1 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
$$

We conclude that the solution set of an inequality consists of all solutions of the inequality.
