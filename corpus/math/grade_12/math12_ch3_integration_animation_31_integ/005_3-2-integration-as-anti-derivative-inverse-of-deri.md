### 3.2 INTEGRATION AS ANTI - DERIVATIVE (INVERSE OF DERIVATIVE)

In chapter 2, we have been finding the derived function (differential coefficient) of a given function. Now we consider the reverse (or inverse) process i.e. we find a function when its derivative is known. In other words we can say that if $\phi^{\prime}(x)=f(x)$, then $\phi(x)$ is called an anti-derivative or an integral of $f(x)$. For example, an anti-derivative of $f(x)=3 x^{2}$ is $\phi(x)=x^{3}$ because $\phi^{\prime}(x)=\frac{d}{d x}\left(x^{3}\right)=3 x^{2}=f(x)$.

The inverse process of differentiation i.e. the process of finding such a function whose derivative is given is called anti-differentiation or integration.

While finding the derivatives of the expressions such as $x^{2}+x, x^{2}+x+5, x^{2}+x-3$ etc., we see that the derivative of each of them is $2 x+1$, that is,
$\frac{d}{d x}\left(x^{2}+x\right)=\frac{d}{d x}\left(x^{2}+x+5\right)=\frac{d}{d x}\left(x^{2}+x-3\right)=2 x+1$
Now if $f(x)=2 x+1$
Then $\phi(x)=x^{2}+x$
is not only anti-derivative of (i). But all anti-derivatives of $f(x)=2 x+1$ are included in $x^{2}+x+c$ where $c$ is the arbitrary constant which can be found if further information is given. As $c$ is not definite, so $\phi(x)+c$ is called the indefinite integral of $f(x)$, that is,
$\int f(x) d x=\Phi(x)+c$
In (ii), $f(x)$ is called integrand and $c$ is named as the constant of integration.
The symbol $\int \ldots d x$ indicates that integrand is to be integrated w.r.t. $x$.
Note that $\frac{d}{d x}$ and $\int \ldots d x$ are inverse operations of each other.
