### 3.1.1 Differentials of Variables

Let *f* be a differentiable function in the interval *a* < *x* < *b*, defined as *y* = *f*(*x*), then

$$
\delta y = f(x + \delta x) - f(x)
$$

and

$$
\lim_{d \to \infty} \frac{\delta y}{dx} = \lim_{d \to \infty} \frac{f(x + \delta x) - f(x)}{\delta x} \quad f'(x), \text{ that is}
$$

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)
$$

We know that before the limit is reached, $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$ differs from *f*'(x) by a very small real number $\varepsilon$.

Let

$$
\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = f'(x) + \varepsilon \qquad \text{where } \varepsilon is very small
$$

or

$$
\delta y = f'(x)\delta x + \varepsilon \quad \delta x \qquad \text{(i)}
$$

The term $f'(x)\delta x$ being more important than the term $\varepsilon \delta x$, is called the differential of the dependent variable *y* and is denoted by *dy* (or *df*)

Thus *dy* = $f'(x)\delta x$ (ii)

As

$$
dx = (x)'\delta x = (1)\delta x, \text{ so}
$$

the differential of *x* is denoted by *dx* and is defined by the relation *dx* = $\delta x$.

The equation (ii) becomes

$$
dy = f'(x) \, dx \qquad \text{(iii)}
$$

**Note:** Instead of *dy*, we can write *df*, that is, *df* = *f*'(x) *dx* where *f*'(x) being coefficient of differential is called differential coefficient.
