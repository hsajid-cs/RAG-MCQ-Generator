### 3.8 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

An equation containing at least one derivative of a dependent, variable with respect to an independent variable such as

$$
y \frac{d y}{d x}+2 x=0
$$

$$
\text { or } \quad \frac{x d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}+\frac{d y}{d x}-2 x=0
$$

is called a differential equation.
Derivatives may be of first or higher orders. A differential equation containing only derivative of first order can be written in terms of differentials. So we can write the equation (i) as $y d y+2 x d x=0$ but the equation (ii) cannot be written in terms of differentials.

Order: The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative in the equation. As the order of the equation (i) is one so it is called a first order differential equation. But equation (ii) contains the second order derivative and is called a second order differential equation.
