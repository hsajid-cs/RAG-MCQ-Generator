### 3.6 THE DEFINITE INTEGRALS

We have already discussed in section 3.2 about the indefinite integral that is, if $\phi^{\prime}(x)=$ $f(x)$, then

$$
\int f(x) d x=\phi(x)+c \text {, where } c \text { is an arbitrary constant }
$$

If $\int f(x) d x=\phi(x)+c$, then the integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$ is denoted by $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x$ (read as
intergral from $a$ to $b$ of $f$ of $x, d x$ ) and is evaluated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x & =\int_{a}^{b} \phi^{\prime}(x) d x \quad \text { (if } f(x)=\phi^{\prime}(x)) \\
& =\left|\phi(x)+c\right|_{a}^{b}=[\phi(b)+c]-[\phi(a)+c]=\phi(b)-\phi(a)
\end{aligned}
$$

$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x$ has a definite value $\phi(b)-\phi(a)$, so it is called the definite integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$. $\phi(b)-\phi(a)$ is denoted as $[\phi(x)]_{a}^{b}$ or $\phi(x)]_{a}^{b}$ (read $\phi(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ )

The interval $[a, b]$ is called the range of integration while $a$ and $b$ are known as the lower and upper limits respectively.

As $\phi(b)-\phi(a)$ is a definite value, so the variable of integration $x$ in $\int f(x) d x$ can be replaced by any other letter.
i.e. $\int f(x) d x=\int f(t) d t=\phi(b)-\phi(a)$

Note: If the lower limit is a constant and the upper limit is a variable, then the integral is a function of the upper limit, that is, $\int f(t) d t=|\phi(t)|_{a}^{b}=\phi(x)-\phi(a)$

For Example, $\int \frac{1}{2} 3 t^{2} d t=\left[t^{2}\right]_{a}^{b}=x^{3}-a^{3}$
The relation $\phi^{\prime}(x)=f(x)$ shows that $f(x)$ gives the rate of change of $\phi(x)$, so the total change in $\phi(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ as $\phi(b)-\phi(a)$ shows the connection between anti-derivatives and definite integral $\int f(x) d x$.
