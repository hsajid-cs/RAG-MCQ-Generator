### 3.2.2 Theorems on Anti-Derivatives

I. The integral of the product of a constant and a function is equal to the product of the constant and the integral of the function.
In symbols,

$$
\int \operatorname{of}(x) d x=a \mid f(x) d x \quad \text { where } a \text { is a constant. }
$$

II. The integral of the sum (or difference) of two functions is equal to the sum (or difference) of their integrals.
In symbols,

$$
\int\left[f_{1}(x) \pm f_{2}(x)\right] d x=\int f_{1}(x) d x \pm \int f_{2}(x) d x
$$
