### 4.4.1 The Point of Intersection of two Straight Lines

Let $\quad l_{1}: a_{1} x+b_{1} y+c_{1}=0$
and $\quad l_{2}: a_{2} x+b_{2} y+c_{2}=0$
be two non-parallel lines. Then $a_{1} b_{2}-b_{1} a_{2} \neq 0$
Let $P\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ be the point of intersection of $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$. Then
$a_{1} x_{1}+b_{1} y_{1}+c_{1}=0$
$a_{2} x_{1}+b_{2} y_{1}+c_{2}=0$
Solving (3) and (4) simultaneously, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{x_{1}}{b_{1} c_{2}-b_{2} c_{1}}=\frac{y_{1}}{a_{1} c_{1}-a_{2} c_{2}}=\frac{1}{a_{1} b_{2}-a_{2} b_{1}} \\
& x_{1}=\frac{b_{1} c_{2}-b_{2} c_{1}}{a_{1} b_{2}-a_{2} b_{1}} \text { and } y_{1} \quad \frac{a_{2} c_{1}-a_{2} c_{2}}{a_{1} b_{2}-a_{2} b_{1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

is the required point of intersection.

Note: $a_{1} b_{2}-a_{2} b_{1} \neq 0$, otherwise $l_{1} \| l_{2}$

Examples 1: Find the point of intersection of the lines

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 5 x+7 y=35 \\
& 3 x-7 y=21
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii)

Solution: We note that the lines are not parallel and so they

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { * If the lines are parallel } \\
& \text { then solution does not } \\
& \text { must intersect at a point. Adding (i) and (ii), we have } \\
& 8 x=56 \quad \text { or } \quad x=7 \\
& \text { Setting this value of } x \text { into (1), we find, } y=0 \text {. } \\
& \text { Thus }(7,0) \text { is the point of intersection of the two lines. }
\end{aligned}
$$

exist ( $z a, b_{1}-a, b_{1}=0$ )

* Before solving equations one should ensure that lines are not parallel.
