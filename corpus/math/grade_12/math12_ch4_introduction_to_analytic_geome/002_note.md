#### **Note:**

(i) If the directed distances *AP* and *PB* have the same sign, then their ratio is positive and *P* is said to divide *AB* internally.

(ii) If the directed distances *AP* and *PB* have opposite signs i.e., *P* is beyond *AB*, then their ratio is negative and *P* is said to divide *AB* **externally**.

$$
\frac{AP}{BP} = \frac{k_1}{k_2} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{AP}{PB} = \frac{k_2}{k_2}
$$

Proceeding as before, we can show in this case that

$$
x = \frac{k_1 v_1 - k_2 v_2}{k_1 - k_2} \quad \text{y} \quad \frac{k_1 v_2 - k_2 v_2}{k_1 - k_2}
$$

Thus *P* is said to divide the line segment *AB* in ratio *k₁*, *k₂*, **internally** or **externally** according as *P* lies between *AB* or beyond *AB*.

(iii) If *k₁ = k₂ = 1:1*, then *P* becomes **midpoint** of *AB* and coordinates of *P* are

$$
x = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \quad \text{y} \quad \frac{y_1 - y_2}{2}
$$

(iv) The above theorem is valid in whichever quadrant *A* and *B* lie.

**Example 1:** Find the coordinates of the point that divides the join of *A* (−6, 3) and *B* (5, −2) in the ratio 2 : 3.

(i) internally

(ii) externally

**Solution:** (i) Here *k₁ = 2, k₂ = 3, x₁ = 6, x₂ = 5*.

By the formula, we have

$$
x = \frac{2 \times 5 + 3 \times (-6)}{2 + 3} \quad \frac{-8}{5} \quad \text{and} \quad y \quad \frac{2(-2) + 3(3)}{2 + 3} \quad 1
$$

Coordinates of the required point are (−8, 5, 1)

(ii) In this case

$$
x = \frac{2 \times 5 - 3 \times (-6)}{2 - 3} \quad \frac{28}{5} \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{2(-2) - 3(3)}{2 + 3} \quad 13
$$

Thus the required point has coordinates (−28, 13)
