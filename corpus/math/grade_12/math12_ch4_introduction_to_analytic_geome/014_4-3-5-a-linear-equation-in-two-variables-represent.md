### 4.3.5 A Linear Equation in two Variables Represents a Straight Line

Theorem: The linear equation $a x+b y+c=0$ in two variables $x$ and $y$ represents a straight line. A linear equation in two variables $x$ and $y$ is

$$
a x+b y+c=0
$$

where $a, b$ and $c$ are constants and $a$ and $b$ are not simultaneously zero.

## 4.3.5 A Linear Equation in two Variables Represents a Straight Line

Theorem: The linear equation $a x+b y+c=0$ in two variables $x$ and $y$ represents a straight line. A linear equation in two variables $x$ and $y$ is

$$
a x+b y+c=0
$$

where $a, b$ and $c$ are constants and $a$ and $b$ are not simultaneously zero.

## Remember that:

The equation (I) represents a straight line and is called the general equation of a straight line.
the $y$-axis at a directed distance $-\frac{c}{a}$ from the $y$-axis.
Case II: $\quad a=0, \quad b \neq 0$
In this case equation (1) takes the form:

$$
b x+c=0 \text { or } y=-\frac{c}{b}
$$

which is an equation of the straight line parallel to $x$-axis at a directed distance $\frac{-c}{b}$ from the $x$-axis.
Case III: $\quad a \neq 0 \quad, \quad b \neq 0$
In this case equation (1) takes the form:

$$
b y=-a x-c \quad \text { or } \quad y=\frac{-a}{b} x-\frac{c}{b}=m x+c
$$

which is the slope-intercept form of the straight line with slope $\frac{-a}{b}$ and $y$-intercept $\frac{-c}{b}$.
Thus the equation $a x+b y+c=0$, always represents a straight line.
