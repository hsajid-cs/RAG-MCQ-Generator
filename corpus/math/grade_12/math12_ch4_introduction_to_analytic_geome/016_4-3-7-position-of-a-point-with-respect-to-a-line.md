### 4.3.7 Position of a point with respect to a line

Consider a non-vertical line $I$

$$
I: a x+b y+c=0
$$

in the $x y$-plane. Obviously, each point of the plane is either above the line or below the line or on the line.

Theorem: Let $P\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$ be a point in the plane not lying on $I$

$$
I: a x+b y+c=0
$$

then $P$ lies
a) above the line (1) if $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c>0$
b) below the line (1) if $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c<0$

Proof: We can suppose that $b>0$ (first multiply the equation by -1 if needed). Draw a perpendicular from $P$ on $x$-axis meeting the line at $\left\langle x_{i} x_{i}, y^{\prime}\right\rangle$.

Thus $a x_{i}+b y^{\prime}+c=0$ so that

$$
y^{\prime}=\frac{a}{b} x_{i} \quad \frac{c}{b}
$$

The point $P\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$ is above the line if $y_{i}>y^{\prime}$ that is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y_{i}-y^{\prime}>0 \\
\text { i.e. } & y_{i}-\left(-\frac{a}{b} x_{i}-\frac{c}{b}\right)>0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad & a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c>0
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly $P\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$ is below the line if

$$
y_{i}-y^{\prime}<0 \quad \text { i.e. } y_{i}-\left(-\frac{a}{b} x_{i}-\frac{c}{b}\right)
$$

or

$$
a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c<0
$$

The point $P\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$ is on the line if

$$
a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c=
$$

Corollary 1. The point $P$ is above or below $I$ respectively if $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c$ and $b$ have the same sign or have opposite signs.

Proof. If $P$ is above $I$, then $y_{i}-y^{\prime}>0$ i.e., $\frac{a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c}{b}>0$
Thus $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c$ and $b$ have the same sign.
Similarly, $P$ is below $I$ if

$$
y_{i}-y^{\prime}<0 \quad \text { i.e., } \frac{a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c}{b}<0
$$

Thus $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c$ and $b$ have opposite signs.
Corollary 2. The point $P\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$ and the origin are
(i) on the same side of $I$ according as $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c$ and $c$ have the same sign.
(ii) on the opposite sides of $I$ according as $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c$ and $c$ have opposite signs.

Proof. (i) The point $P\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$ and $O(0,0)$ are on the same side of $I$ if $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c$ and $a .0+b .0+c$ have the same sign.
(ii) Proof is left as an exercise

Example 1: Check whether the point $(-2,4)$ lies above or below the line $4 x+5 y-3=0$

Solution: Here $b=5$ is positive. Also
$4(-2)+5(4)-3=-8+20-3=9>0$
The coefficient of $y$ in (1) and the expression (2) have the same sign and so the point $(-2,4)$ lies above (1).

Example 2: $\quad$ Check whether the origin and the point $P(5,-8)$ lie on the same side or on the opposite sides of the line:

$$
3 x+7 y+15=0
$$

## Solution:

Here $\quad c=15$
For $P(5,-8)$,
$3(5)+7(-8)+15=-26<0$
But $\quad c=15>0$
$c$ and the expression (2) have opposite signs. Thus $O(0,0)$ and $P(5,-8)$ are on the opposite sides of (1).

Note: To check whether a point $P\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ lies above or below the line $a x+b y+c=0$
we make the co-efficient of $y$ positive by multiplying the equation by $(-1)$ if needed.
