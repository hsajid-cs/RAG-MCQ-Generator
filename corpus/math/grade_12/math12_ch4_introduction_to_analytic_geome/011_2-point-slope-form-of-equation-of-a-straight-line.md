#### 2. Point-slope Form of Equation of a Straight Line:

**Theorem:** Equation of a non-vertical straight line *I* with slope *m* and passing through a point *Q*(*x*, *y*) is

$$
y-y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$

**Proof:** Let \( P(x, y) \) be an arbitrary point of the straight line with slope \( m \) and passing through \( Q(x_1, y_1) \).

As \( Q(x_1, y_1) \) and \( P(x, y) \) both lie on the line, so the slope of the line is

$$
m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} \text{ or } y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$

which is an equation of the straight line passing through \( x_1, y_1 \) with slope \( m \).
