### 4.3 EQUATIONS OF STRAIGHT LINES

Inclination of a Line: The angle $\alpha\left(0^{\circ}<\alpha<180^{\circ}\right)$ measured counterclockwise from positive $x$-axis to a non-horizontal straight line $l$ is called the inclination of $l$.
Observe that the angle $\alpha$ in the different positions of the line $l$ is $\alpha_{1} 0^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ respectively.

## Note:

(i) If $l$ is parallel to $x$-axis, then $\alpha=0^{\circ}$
(ii) If $l$ is parallel to $y$-axis, then $\alpha=90^{\circ}$

Slope or gradient of a line: When we walk on an inclined plane, we cover horizontal distance (run) as well as vertical distance (rise) at the same time.
It is harder to climb a steeper inclined plane. The measure of steepness (ratio of rise to the run) is termed as slope or gradient of the inclined path and is denoted by $m$.
$$
m=\frac{r i s e}{r u n}=\frac{y}{x}=\tan \alpha
$$

In analytical geometry, slope or gradient $\boldsymbol{m}$ of a non-vertical straight line with $\alpha$ as its inclination is defined by: $m: \tan \alpha$

If $l$ is horizontal its slope is zero and if $l$ is vertical then its slope is undefined.
If $0<\alpha<90^{\circ}, \mathrm{m}$ is positive and if $90^{\circ}<\alpha<180^{\circ}$, then $m$ is negative
