### 4.4.6 Area of a Triangular Region Whose Vertices are Given

To find the area of a triangular region whose vertices are: $P\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right), Q\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ and $R\left(x_{3}, y_{3}\right)$.
Draw perpendiculars $\overline{P L}, \overline{Q N}$ and $\overline{R M}$ on $x$-axis.
Area of the triangular region $P Q R$

- Area of the trapezoidal region $P L M R$
+ Area of the trapezoidal region $R M N Q$
- Area of the trapezoidal region $P L N Q$.
$=\frac{1}{2}\left(\left|\overline{P L}\right|+\left|\overline{R M}\right|\right)\left(\left|\overline{L M}\right|\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(\left|\overline{R M}\right|+\left|\overline{Q N}\right|\right)\left(\left|\overline{M N}\right|\right)-\frac{1}{2}\left(\left|\overline{P L}\right|+\left|\overline{Q N}\right|\right)\left(\left|\overline{L N}\right|\right)$
$=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(y_{1}+y_{2}\right)\left(x_{3}-x_{1}\right)+\left(y_{2}+y_{2}\right)\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)-\left(y_{1}+y_{2}\right)\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)\right]$
$=\frac{1}{2}\left(x_{1} y_{1}+x_{2} y_{2}-x_{1} y_{1}+x_{1} y_{2}+x_{2} y_{2}+x_{2} y_{2}-x_{2} y_{2}-x_{2} y_{1}+x_{1} y_{1}+x_{1} y_{2}\right)$
$=\frac{1}{2}\left(x_{1} y_{1}-x_{1} y_{2}+x_{2} y_{2}-x_{2} y_{2}-x_{2} y_{1}+x_{1} y_{2}\right)$
Thus required area $A$ is given by:
$\Delta=\frac{1}{2}\left(x_{1}\left(y_{2}-y_{3}\right)+x_{2}\left(y_{3}-y_{1}\right)+x_{3}\left(y_{1}-y_{2}\right)\right)$

Forollary: If the points $P, Q$ and $R$ are collinear, then
$\Delta=0$

Note: In numerical problems, if sign of the area is negative, then it is to be omitted.
Example 1: Find the area of the region bounded by the triangle with vertices $(a, b+c)$, $(a, b-c)$ and $(-a, c)$.
Solution: Required area $\Delta$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta=\frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{ll}
a & b+c \\
a & b-c
\end{array}\right] \\
& \left.\begin{array}{ll}
a \\
-a & c
\end{array}\right] \\
& =\frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{ll}
a & b+c \\
a & c
\end{array}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

Trapezium:
A quadrilateral having two parallel and two non-parallel sides.
Area of trapezoidal region:
$\frac{1}{2}$ (sum of $\|$ sides) /distance between $\|$ sides
$=\frac{1}{2}[-2 c(a+a)]$, expanding by the second row
$=-2 c a$
Thus $\Delta=2 c a$
Example 2: By considering the area of the region bounded by the triangle with vertices $A(1,4), B(2,-3)$ and $C(3,-10)$
check whether the three points are collinear or not.
Solution: Area $\Delta$ of the region bounded by the triangle $A B C$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta=\frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 4 \\
2 & -3 \\
3 & -10
\end{array}\right] \quad=\frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 4 \\
1 & -7 \\
3 & -14
\end{array}\right] \text { by } R_{2}-R_{1} \text { and } R_{3}-R_{1} \\
& =\frac{1}{2}[1(-14+14)] \text {, expanding by third column } \\
& =0
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus the points are collinear.
