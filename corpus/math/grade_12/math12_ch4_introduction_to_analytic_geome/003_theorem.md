#### **Theorem:**

The centroid of a *ΔABC* is a point that divides each median in the ratio 2 : 1. Using this show that medians of a triangle are concurrent.

**Proof:** Let the vertices of a *ΔABC* have coordinates as shown in the figure.

Midpoint of *BC* is *D* (x, y, z, x₀, y₁, z, z₀).

Let *G* (x, y) be the centroid of the *Δ*. Then *G* divides *AD* in the ratio 2 : 1. Therefore

$$
\frac{2 \cdot \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} + 1 \cdot x_1}{2 + 1} \quad \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}
$$

Similarly, y = x, y, z, x₀.

In the same way, we can show that coordinate of the point that divides *BE* and *CF* each in the ratio 2 : 1 are (x, y, z, x₀, y₁, z, z₀).

Thus (x, y) lies on each median and so the medians of the *ΔABC* are concurrent.

**Theorem:** Bisectors of angles of a triangle are concurrent.

**Proof:** Let the coordinates of the vertices of a triangle be as shown in the figure.

Suppose |*BC*| = *a*, |*CA*| = *b* and |*AB*| = *c*.

Let the bisector of *LA* meet *BC* at *D*. Then *D* divides *BC* in the ratio *c* : *b*. Therefore

coordinates of $D$ are $\left(\frac{c x_{1}+b x_{2}}{b+c} \cdot \frac{c y_{1}+b y_{2}}{b+c}\right)$
The bisector of $\angle B$ meets $A C$ at $I$ and $I$ divides $A D$ in the ratio $c:|B D|$
Now $\frac{|B D|}{|D C|}=\frac{c}{b}$ or $\frac{|D C|}{|B D|} \cdot \frac{b}{c}$
or $\frac{|D C|+|B D|}{|B D|}=\frac{b+c}{c}$
or $\frac{a}{|B D|}=\frac{b+c}{c}$ or $|B D| \cdot \frac{a c}{b+c}$
Thus $I$ divides $A D$ in the ratio $c: \frac{a c}{b+c}$ or in the ratio $b+c: a$ Coordinates of $I$ are

$$
\left(\frac{(b+c) \frac{b x_{2}+c x_{1}}{b+c}+a x_{1}}{a+b+c} \cdot \frac{(b+c) \frac{b y_{2}+c y_{1}}{b+c}+a y_{1}}{a+b+c}\right)
$$

i.e., $\quad\left(\frac{a x_{1}+b x_{2}+c x_{1}}{a+b+c} \cdot \frac{a y_{1}+b y_{2}+c y_{2}}{a+b+c}\right)$

The symmetry of these coordinates shows that the bisector of $\angle C$ will also pass through this point.

Thus the angle bisectors of a triangle are concurrent.
