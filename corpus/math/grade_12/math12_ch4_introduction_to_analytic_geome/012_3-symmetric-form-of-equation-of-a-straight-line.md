### 3. Symmetric Form of Equation of a Straight Line:

We have \( \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} = \tan \alpha \), where \( \alpha \) is the inclination of the line.

$$
\lim_{m \to \infty} \frac{x - x_1}{\cos \alpha} = \frac{y - y_1}{\sin \alpha} = r(\sin \alpha)
$$

This is called **symmetric** form of equation of the line.

**Example 2:** Write down an equation of the straight line passing through \( (5, 1) \) and parallel to a line passing through the points \( (0, -1) \), \( (7, -15) \).

**Solution:** Let \( m \) be the slope of the required straight line, then

$$
m = \frac{-15 - (-1)}{7 - 0} \qquad \text{(☞ Slopes of parallel lines are equal)}
$$

$$
= -2
$$

As the point \( (5, 1) \) lies on the required line having slope -2 so, by point-slope form of equation of the straight line, we have

$$
y - (1) = -2(x - 5)
$$

or

$$
y = -2x + 11
$$

or

$$
2x + y - 11 = 0
$$

is an equation of the required line.
