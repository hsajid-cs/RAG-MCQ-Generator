### 4.6.2 To find measure of the angle between the lines represented by

$$
a x^{2}+2 h x y+b y^{2}=0
$$

We have already seen that the lines represented by (1) are

$$
b y+x\left(h+\sqrt{h^{3}-a b}\right)=0
$$

and $\quad b y+x\left(h-\sqrt{h^{3}-a b}\right)=0$
Now slopes of (2) and (3) are respectively given by:

$$
m_{1}=\frac{-\left(h+\sqrt{h^{3}-a b}\right)}{b}, \text { and } m_{2}=\frac{-\left(h-\sqrt{h^{3}-a b}\right)}{b}
$$

Therefore, $m_{1}+m_{2}=\frac{-2 h}{b} \quad$ and $m_{1} m_{2} \quad \frac{a}{b}$
If $\theta$ is measure of the angle between the lines (2) and (3), then

$$
\tan \theta=\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)^{2}-4 m_{1} m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\frac{4 h^{3}-4 a}{b^{3}}-\frac{a}{b}}}{1+\frac{a}{b}} \cdot \frac{2 \sqrt{h^{3}-a b}}{a+b}
$$

The two lines are parallel, if $\theta=0$, so that $\tan \theta=0$ which implies $\boldsymbol{h}^{3}-\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{0}$, which is the condition for the lines to be coincident.
If the lines are orthogonal, then $\theta=90^{\circ}$, so that $\tan \theta$ is not defined. This implies $\boldsymbol{a}+\boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{0}$. Hence the condition for (1) to represent a pair of orthogonal (perpendicular) lines is that sum of the coefficients of $\boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{2}}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}^{\mathbf{2}}$ is $\mathbf{0}$.

Example 1: Find measure of the angle between the lines represented by

$$
x^{2}-x y-6 y^{2}=0
$$

Solution. Here $a=1 ; \quad b=\frac{1}{2}, b \quad 6$

If $\theta$ is measure of the angle between the given lines, then

$$
\tan \theta=\frac{2 \sqrt{b^{2}-a b}}{a+b}=\frac{2 \sqrt{\frac{1+6}{4}}}{-5}=-1 \Rightarrow \theta=135^{\circ}
$$

Acute angle between the lines $=180^{\circ}-\theta=180^{\circ}-135^{\circ}=45^{\circ}$
Example2: Find a joint equation of the straight lines through the origin perpendicular to the lines represented by

$$
x^{2}+x y-6 y^{2}=0
$$

Solution: (1) may be written as

$$
(x-2 y)(x+3 y)=0
$$

Thus the lines represented by (1) are

$$
x-2 y=0
$$

and $\quad x+3 y=0$
The line through $(0,0)$ and perpendicular to (2) is

$$
y \Rightarrow 2 x \text { or } \quad+y \quad \nRightarrow x \quad 0
$$

Similarly, the line through $(0,0)$ and perpendicular to (3) is

$$
y=3 x-\text { or } \quad y \quad 3 x \quad 0
$$

Joint equation of the lines (4) and (5) is

$$
(y+2 x)(y-3 x)=0 \quad \text { or } \quad y^{2}-x y-6 x^{2}=0
$$
