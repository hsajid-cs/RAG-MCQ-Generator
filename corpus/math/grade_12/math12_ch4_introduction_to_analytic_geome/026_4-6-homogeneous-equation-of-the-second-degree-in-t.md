### 4.6 HOMOGENEOUS EQUATION OF THE SECOND DEGREE IN TWO VARIABLES

We have already seen that if a graph is a straight line, then its equation is a linear equation in the variables $x$ and $y$. Conversely, the graph of any linear equation in $x$ and $y$ is a straight line.

Suppose we have two straight lines represented by

$$
a_{x} x+b_{y} y+c_{z}=0
$$

and

$$
a_{y} x+b_{z} y+c_{x}=0
$$

Multiplying equations (1) and (2), we have

$$
\left(a_{x} x+b_{y} y+c_{z}\right)\left(a_{y} x+b_{z} y+c_{x}\right)=0
$$

It is a second degree equation in $x$ and $y$.
Equation (3) is called joint equation of the pair of lines (1) and (2). On the other hand, given an equation of the second degree in $x$ and $y$, say

$$
a x^{2}+2 h x y+b y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0
$$

where $a \neq 0$, represents equations of a pair of lines if (4) can be resolved into two linear factors. In this section, we shall study special joint equations of pairs of lines which pass through the origin.

Let $y=m_{1} x$ and $y=m_{2} x$ be two lines passing through the origin. Their joint equation is: $\left(y-m_{1} x\right)\left(y-m_{2} x\right)=0$
or $\quad y^{2}-\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) x y+m_{1} m_{2} x^{2}=0$
Equation (5) is a special type of a second degree homogeneous equation.
