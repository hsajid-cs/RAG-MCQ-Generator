### 4.4.5 Distance Between two Parallel Lines

The distance between two parallel lines is the distance from any point on one of the lines to the other line.

Example: Find the distance between the parallel lines
$I: 2 x-5 y+13=0$ and
$I_{1}: 2 x-5 y+6=0$

Solution: First find any point on one of the lines, say $I_{1}$. If $x=1$ lies on $I_{1}$, then
$y=3$ and the point $(1,3)$ lies on it. The distance $d$ from $(1,3)$ to $I_{2}$ is

$$
d=\frac{|2(1)-5(3)+6|}{\sqrt{(-2)^{2}+5^{2}}} \quad \frac{|2-15+6|}{\sqrt{4+25}} \quad \frac{7}{\sqrt{29}}
$$

The distance between the parallel lines is $\frac{7}{\sqrt{29}}$.
