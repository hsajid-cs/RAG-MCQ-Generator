#### 1. Slope-Intercept form of Equation of a Straight Line:

**Theorem:** Equation of a non-vertical straight line with slope *m* and *y*-intercept *c* is given by:

$$ y = mx + c $$

**Proof:** Let *P*(*x*, *y*) be an arbitrary point of the straight line *I* with slope *m* and *y*-intercept *c*. As *C*(0, *c*) and *P*(*x*, *y*) lie on the line, so the slope of the line is:

$$ m = \frac{y - c}{x - 0} \quad \text{or} \quad y - c = mx \quad \text{and} \quad y = mx + c $$

is an equation of *I*.

The equation of the line for which

$$ c = 0 \text{ is } \qquad y = mc $$

In this case the line passes through the origin.

**Example 1:** Find an equation of the straight line if

- (a) its slope is 2 and *y*-intercept is 5
- (b) it is perpendicular to a line with slope –6 and its *y*-intercept is $$\frac{4}{3}$$

**Solution:** (a) The slope and *y*-intercept of the line are respectively:

$$ m = 2 \qquad \text{and} \qquad c = 5 $$

Thus *y* = 2*x* + 5 (Slope-intercept form: *y* = *mx* + *c*)

is the required equation.

- (b) The slope of the given line is

$$ m_i = -6 $$

The slope of the required line is:

$$ m_i = \frac{1}{m_i} \quad \frac{1}{6} $$

The slope and *y*-intercept of the required line are respectively:

$$ m = \frac{1}{6} \qquad \text{(slope of } \perp \text{ line is } -6) \quad \text{and} \qquad c = \frac{4}{3} $$

Thus *y* = $$\frac{1}{6}(*)$$ or *y* = $$\frac{4}{3}$$ or *6y* = $$\frac{8}{3} $$

is the required equation.
