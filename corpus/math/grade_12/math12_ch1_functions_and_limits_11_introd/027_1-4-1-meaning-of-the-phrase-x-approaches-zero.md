### **1.4.1 Meaning of the Phrase "x approaches zero"**

Suppose a variable *x* assumes in succession a series of values as

$$
1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \ldots
$$

i.e.,

$$
1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2^2}, \frac{1}{2^3}, \frac{1}{2^4}, \ldots, \frac{1}{2^n}
$$

We notice that *x* is becoming smaller and smaller as *n* increases and can be made as small as we please by taking *n* sufficiently large. This unending decrease of *x* is symbolically written as *x* → 0 and is read as "*x* approaches zero" or "*x* tends to zero".

**Note:** The symbol *x* → 0 is quite different from *x* = 0

- (i) *x* → 0 means that *x* is very close to zero but not actually zero.
- (ii) *x* ≈ 0 means that *x* is actually zero.
