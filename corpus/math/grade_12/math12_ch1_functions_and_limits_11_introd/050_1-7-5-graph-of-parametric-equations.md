### 1.7.5 Graph of Parametric Equations

**(a) Graph the curve that has the parametric equations**

$$x = t^2, y = t \quad -2 \leq t \leq 2 \tag{3}$$

**Solution:** For the choice of t in [-2, 2], we prepare a table for some values of x and y satisfying the given equation.

|  t | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  x | 4 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 4  |
|  y | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2  |

We plot the points (x, y), connecting these points with a smooth curve shown in the figure, we obtain the graph of a parabola with equation $$y^2 = x$$.
