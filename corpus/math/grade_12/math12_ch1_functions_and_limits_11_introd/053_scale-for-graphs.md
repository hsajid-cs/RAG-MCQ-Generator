### Scale for graphs

- Along *x*-axis, length of side of small square = $$\frac{\pi}{6}$$ radian
- Along *y*-axis, length of side of small square = 0.1 unit
- Two points (0, 0) and (π/3, 1) lie on the line *y* = *x*

We prepare a table for some values of *x* and *y* in the interval $$-\pi \leq x \leq \pi$$ it satisfies the equation $$y = \cos x$$.

|  *x* | $-\pi$ | -5π/6 | -2π/3 | $-\pi/2$ | $-\pi/3$ | $-\pi/6$ | 0 | $\pi/6$ | $\pi/3$ | $\pi/2$ | 2π/3 | 5π/6 | $\pi$  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  $y = \cos x$ | -1 | -.87 | -.5 | 0 | -.5 | .87 | 1 | .87 | .5 | 0 | -.5 | -.87 | -1  |

The graph shows that the equations $$y = x$$ and $$y = \cos x$$ intersect at only where $$x = \frac{43}{180} \pi$$ radian = 0.73

**Check:** $$\cos \left(\frac{43}{180} \pi\right) = \cos 43^\circ = 0.73$$

# Note: Since the scales along the two axes are different so the line $y=x$ is not equally inclined to both the axes.
