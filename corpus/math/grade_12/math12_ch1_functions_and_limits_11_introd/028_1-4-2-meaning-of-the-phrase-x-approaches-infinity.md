### **1.4.2 Meaning of the Phrase "x approaches infinity"**

Suppose a variable *x* assumes in succession a series of values as

$$
1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, \ldots
$$

i.e.,
1, 10, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6, 10^7, 10^8, 10^9, 10^10
$$

It is clear that *x* is becoming larger and larger as *n* increases and can be made as large as we please by taking *n* sufficiently large. This unending increase of *x* is symbolically written as "*x* → ∞" and is read as "*x* approaches infinity" or "*x* tends to infinity".
