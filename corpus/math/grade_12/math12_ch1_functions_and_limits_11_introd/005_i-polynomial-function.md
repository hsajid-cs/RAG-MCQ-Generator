### **(i) Polynomial Function**

A function *P* of the form *P(x)* = *a_{n} x^{n}* + *a_{n-1} x^{n-1}* + *a_{n-2} x^{n-2}* + .... + *a_{2} x^{2}* + *a_{1} x + a_{0}* for all *x*, where the coefficient *a_{n}*, *a_{n-1}*, *a_{n-2}*, .... , *a_{2}*, *a_{1}*, *a_{0}* are real numbers and the exponents are non-negative integers, is called a **polynomial function**.

The domain and range of *P(x)* are, in general, subsets of real numbers.

If *a_{n}* ≠ 0, then *P(x)* is called a polynomial function of degree *n* and *a_{n}* is the leading coefficient of *P(x)*.

For example, *P(x)* = 2*x^{4}* − 3*x^{3}* + 2*x* − 1 is a **polynomial function** of degree 4 with leading coefficient 2.
