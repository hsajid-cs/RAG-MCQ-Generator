### **1.7.3 Graph of Common Logarithmic Function f(x) = lg x.**

If x = 10^x, then y = lg x

Now for all real values of y, 10^x > 0 ⇒ x > 0

This means lg x exists only when x > 0

⇒ Domain of the lg x is +ve real numbers.

**Note:** lg x is undefined at x = 0.

For graph of f(x) = lg x, we find the values of lg x from the common logarithmic table for various values of x > 0.

Table of some of the corresponding values of x and f(x) is as under:

|  x | →0 | 0.1 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | →+∞  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  y = f(x) = lg x | →−∞ | -1 | 0 | 0.30 | 0.60 | 0.77 | 0.90 | 1 | →+∞  |

Plotting the points (x, y) and joining them with a smooth curve we get the graph as shown in the figure.
