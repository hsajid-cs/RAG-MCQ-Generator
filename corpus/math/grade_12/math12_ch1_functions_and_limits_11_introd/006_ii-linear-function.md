### **(ii) Linear Function**

If the degree of a polynomial function is 1, then it is called a **linear function**. A linear function is of the form: *f(x)* = *ax* + *b* (*a* ≠ 0), *a*, *b* are real numbers.

For example *f(x)* = 3*x* + 4 or *y* = 3*x* + 4 is a **linear function**. Its domain and range are the set of real numbers.
