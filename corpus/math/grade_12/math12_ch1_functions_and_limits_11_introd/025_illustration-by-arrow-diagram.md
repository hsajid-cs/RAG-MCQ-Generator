The inverse function reverses the correspondence of the original function, so that

*f*⁻¹(*y*) = *x*, when *f*(*x*) = *y*

and *f*(*x*) = *y*, when *f*⁻¹(*y*) = *x*.

We can find the composition of the functions *f* and *f*⁻¹ as follows:

and (*fof*⁻¹)(*y*) = *f*(*f*⁻¹(*y*)) = *f*(*x*) = *y*.

We note that *f*⁻¹ *of* and *fof*⁻¹ are identity mappings on the domain and range of *f* and *f*⁻¹ respectively.
