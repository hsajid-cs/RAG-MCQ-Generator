### 1.4.5 Limit of a Function

Let a function $f(x)$ be defined in an open interval near the number " $a$ " (need not be at $a$ ).

If, as $x$ approaches " $a$ " from both left and right side of " $a$ ", $f(x)$ approaches a specific number " $L$ " then " $L$ ", is called the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$.
Symbolically it is written as:

$$
\lim _{x \rightarrow a^{-}} f(x)=\mathrm{L} \text { read as "limit of } f(x) \text {, as } x \rightarrow a \text {, is } L \text { ". }
$$

It is neither desirable nor practicable to find the limit of a function by numerical approach. We must be able to evaluate a limit in some mechanical way. The theorems on limits will serve this purpose. Their proofs will be discussed in higher classes.
