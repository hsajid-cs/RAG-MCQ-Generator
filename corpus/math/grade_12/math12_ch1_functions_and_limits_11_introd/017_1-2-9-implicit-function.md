### 1.2.9 Implicit Function

If $x$ and $y$ are so mixed up and $y$ cannot be expressed in terms of the independent variable $x$, then $y$ is called an implicit function of $x$. For example,
(i) $x^{2}+x y+y^{2}=2$
(ii) $\frac{x y^{2}-y+9}{x y}=1$ are implicit functions of $x$ and $y$.

Symbolically it is written as $f(x, y)=0$.

## (ix) Parametric Functions

Some times a curve is described by expressing both $x$ and $y$ as function of a third variable " $t$ " or " $\theta$ " which is called a parameter. The equations of the type $x=f(t)$ and $y=g(t)$ are called the parametric equations of the curve.

The functions of the form:
(i) $\begin{aligned} x=a t^{2} & x=a \cos t \\ y=a t & y=a \sin t\end{aligned}$
(ii) $\begin{aligned} x=a \cos \theta & x=a \sec \theta \\ y=b \sin \theta & y=a \tan \theta\end{aligned}$ (iv) $\quad y=a \tan \theta$ are called parametric functions. Here the variable $t$ or $\theta$ is called parameter.
