### **Method to draw the graph:**

To draw the graph of *y* = *f*(*x*), we give arbitrary values of our choice to *x* and find the corresponding values of *y*. In this way we get ordered pairs (*x*, *y*, *y*₁), (*x*, *y*₂), (*x*, *y*₃), etc. These ordered pairs represent points of the graph in the Cartesian plane. We add these points and join them together to get the graph of the function.

**Example 5:** Find the domain and range of the function *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1 and draw its graph.

**Solution:** Here *y* = *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1

We see that *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1 is defined for every real number. Further, for every real number *x*, *y* = *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1 is a non-negative real number.

> Hence Domain *f* = set of all real numbers

and Range *f* = set of all non-negative real numbers except the points 0 ≤ *y* < 1.

For graph of *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1, we assign some values to *x* from its domain and find the corresponding values in the range *f* as shown in the table:

|  *x* | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  *y* = *f*(*x*) | 10 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 10  |

Plotting the points (*x*, *y*) and joining them with a smooth curve, we get the graph of the function *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1, which is shown in the figure.
