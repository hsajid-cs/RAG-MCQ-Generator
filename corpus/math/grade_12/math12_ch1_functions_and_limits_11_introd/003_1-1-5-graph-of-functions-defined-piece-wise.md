### **1.1.5 Graph of Functions Defined Piece-wise.**

When the function *f* is defined by two rules, we draw the graphs of two functions as explained in the following example:

**Example 7:** Find the domain and range of the function defined by:

$$f(x) = \begin{cases} x & \text{when } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \ x - 1 & \text{when } 1 < x \leq 2 \end{cases} \quad \text{also draw its graph.}$$

**Solution:** Here domain *f* = [0, 1] ∪ [1, 2] = [0, 2]. This function is composed of the following two functions:

(i) *f(x)* = *x* when 0 ≤ *x* ≤ 1

(ii) *f(x)* = *x* − 1, when 1 < *x* ≤ 2

To find the table of values of *x* and *y* = *f(x)* in each case, we take suitable values to *x* in the domain *f*. Thus

|  Table for *y* = *f(x)* = *x* |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  *x* | 0 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  *y* = *f(x)* | 0 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |

Plotting the points (*x*, *y*) and joining them we get two straight lines as shown in the figure. This is the graph of the given function.
