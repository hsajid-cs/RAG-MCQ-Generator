#### **(i) By finding the area of circumscribing regular polygon**

Consider a circle of unit radius which circumscribes a square (4-sided regular polygon) as shown in figure (1).

The side of square is √2 and its area is 2 square unit. It is clear that the area of inscribed 4-sided polygon is less than the area of the circum-circle.

Bisecting the arcs between the vertices of the square, we get an inscribed 8-sided polygon as shown in figure 2. Its area is 2√2 square unit which is closer to the area of circum-circle. A further similar bisection of the arcs gives an inscribed 16-sided polygon as shown in figure (3) with area 3.061 square unit which is more closer to the area of circum-circle.

It follows that as '*n*' , the number of sides of the inscribed polygon increases, the area of polygon increases and becoming nearer to 3.142 which is the area of circle of unit radius i.e.,

$$
\pi^2 = \pi(1)^2 = \pi \approx 3.142.
$$

We express this situation by saying that the limiting value of the area of the inscribed polygon is the area of the circle as *n* approaches infinity, i.e.,

$$
\text{Area of inscribed polygon} \rightarrow \text{Area of circle} \tag{18}
$$

$$
\text{as } n \rightarrow \infty
$$

Thus area of circle of unit radius = π = 3.142 (approx.)
