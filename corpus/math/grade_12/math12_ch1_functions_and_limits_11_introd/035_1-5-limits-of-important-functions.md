### 1.5 LIMITS OF IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS

If, by substituting the number that $x$ approaches into the function, we get $\binom{0}{0}$, then we evaluate the limit as follows:

We simplify the given function by using algebraic technique of making factors if possible and cancel the common factors. The method is explained in the following important limits.
