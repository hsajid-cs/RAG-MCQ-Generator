### 1.7.2 Graph of the Exponential Function $f(x)=e^{x}$

As the approximate value of ' $e$ ' is 2.718
The graph of $e^{x}$ has the same characteristics and properties as that of $a^{x}$ when $a>1$ (discussed above).

We prepare the table of some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ near the origin as follows:

|  x | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  y = f(x) = e^x | 0.05 | 0.135 | 0.36 | 1 | 2.718 | 7.38 | 20.07  |

Plotting the points (x, y) and joining them with smooth curve as shown, we get the graph of y = e^x.
