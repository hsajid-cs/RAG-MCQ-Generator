### 1.1.4 Graphs of Algebraic functions

If *f* is a real-valued function of real numbers, then the graph of *f* in the *xy*-plane is defined to be the graph of the equation *y* = *f*(*x*).

The graph of a function *f* is the set of points {(*x*, *y*) | *y* = *f*(*x*)}, *x* is in the domain of *f* in the Cartesian plane for which (*x*, *y*) is an ordered pair of *f*. The graph provides a visual technique for determining whether the set of points represents a function or not. If a vertical line intersects a graph in more than one point, it is not the graph of a function.

Explanation is given in the figure.
