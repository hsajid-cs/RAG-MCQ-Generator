### 1.5.7 The Sandwitch Theorem

Let $f, g$ and $h$ be functions such that $f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x)$ for all numbers $x$ in some open interval containing "c", except possibly at $c$ itself.

$$
\text { If } \quad \operatorname{Lim}_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L \text { and } \quad \operatorname{Lim}_{x \rightarrow c} h(x)=L, \text { then } \quad \operatorname{Lim}_{x \rightarrow c} g(x)=L
$$

Many limit problems arise that cannot be directly evaluated by algebraic techniques. They require geometric arguments, so we evaluate an important theorem.
