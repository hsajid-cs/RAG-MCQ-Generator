### 1.7.6 Graphs of Discontinuous Functions

**Example 1:** Graph the function defined by $$y = \begin{cases} x & \text{when } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \ x - 1 & \text{when } 1 < x \leq 2 \end{cases}$$

**Solution:** The domain of the function is 0 ≤ x ≤ 2. For 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, the graph of the function is that of y = x and for 1 < x ≤ 2, the graph of the function is that of y = x - 1.

We prepare the table for some values of x and y in 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 satisfying the equations y = x and y = x - 1.

|  x | 0 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 1 | 1.5 | 1.8 | 2  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  y | 0 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 1 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 1  |

Plot the points (*x*, *y*). Connecting these points we get two straight lines, which is the graph of a discontinuous function.

**Example 2:** Graph the function defined by $$y = \frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}, \quad x \neq 3$$

**Solution:** The domain of the function consists of all real numbers except 3.

When *x* = 3, both the numerator and denominator are zero, and $$\frac{0}{0}$$ is undefined.

Simplifying we get $$y = \frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3} = \frac{(x - 3)(x + 3)}{x - 3} = x + 3$$ provided *x* ≠ 3.

We prepare a table for different values of *x* and *y* satisfy the equation $$y = x + 3$$ and *x* ≠ 3.

|  *x* | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2.9 | 3 | 3.1 | 4  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  *Y* | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 5.9 | 6 | 6.1 | 7  |

Plot the points (*x*, *y*) and joining these points we get the graph of the function which is a straight line except the point (3, 6).

The graph is shown in the figure. This is a broken straight line with a break at the point (3, 6).
