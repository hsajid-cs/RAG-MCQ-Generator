### 1.7.7 Graphical Solution of the Equations

(i) $$\cos x = x$$ (ii) $$\sin x = x$$ (iii) $$\tan x = x$$

We solve the equation $$\cos x = x$$ and leave the other two equations as an exercise for the students.

**Solution:** To find the solution of the equation $$\cos x = x$$, we draw the graphs of the two functions $$y = x$$ and $$y = \cos x$$: $$-\pi \leq x \leq \pi$$
