### **1.7.5 Graphs of Implicit Functions**

**(a) Graph of the circle of the form** x^2 + y^2 = a^2

**Example 1:** Graph the circle x^2 + y^2 = 4

**Solution:** The graph of the equation x^2 + y^2 = 4 is a circle of radius 2, centered at the origin and hence there are vertical lines that cut the graph more than once. This can also be seen algebraically by solving (1) for y in terms of x.

$$y = \pm \sqrt{4 - x^2}$$

The equation does not define y as a function of x.

For example, if x = 1, then y = ±√3.

Hence ((1, √3)) and ((1, −√3)) are two points on the circle and vertical line passes through these two points.

We can regard the circle as the union of two semi-circles.

$$y = \sqrt{4 - x^2} \text{ and } y = -\sqrt{4 - x^2}$$

Each of which defines y as a function of x.

We observe that if we replace (x, y) in turn by (-x, y), (x, −y) and (-x, −y), there is no change in the given equation. Hence the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, x-axis and the origin.

$$x = 0 \text{ implies } y^2 = 4 \Rightarrow y = \pm 2$$

$$x = 1 \text{ implies } y^2 = 3 \Rightarrow y = \pm \sqrt{3}$$

$$x = 2 \text{ implies } y^2 = 0 \Rightarrow y = 0$$

By assigning values of x, we find the values of y. So we prepare a table for some values of x and y satisfying equation (1).

|  x | 0 | 1 | $$\sqrt{3}$$ | 2 | -1 | -$$\sqrt{3}$$ | -2  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  y | ±2 | $$\pm$$\sqrt{3}$$ | ±1 | 0 | $$\pm$$\sqrt{3}$$ | ±1 | 0  |

Plotting the points (x, y) and connecting them with a smooth curve as shown in the figure, we get the graph of a circle.

**(b) The graph of ellipse of the form $$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$**

**Example 2:** Graph $$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$ i.e., 9x² + 4y² = 36

**Solution:** We observe that if we replace (x, y) in turn by (-x, y), (x, -y) and (-x, -y), there is no change in the given equation. Hence the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, x-axis and the origin.

$$y = 0 \text{ implies } \quad x^2 = 4 \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm 2$$

$$x = 0 \text{ implies } \quad y^2 = 9 \Rightarrow \quad y = \pm 3$$

Therefore x-intercepts are 2 and -2 and y-intercepts are 3 and -3. By assigning values of x, we find the values of y. So we prepare a table for some values of x and y satisfying equation (1).

|  x | 0 | 1 | 2 | -1 | -2  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  y | ±3 | $$\pm$$\sqrt{\frac{27}{4}}$ | 0 | $$\pm$$\sqrt{\frac{27}{4}}$ | 0  |

Plotting the points (x, y), connecting these points with a smooth curve as shown in the figure, we get the graph of an ellipse.
