### 1.6.1 One-Sided Limits

In defining $\operatorname{Lim}_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x)$, we restricted $x$ to an open interval containing $c$ i.e., we studied the behavior of $f$ on both sides of $c$. However, in some cases it is necessary to investigate one-sided limits i.e., the left hand limit and the right hand limit.

## (i) The Left Hand Limit

$\operatorname{Lim}_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x)=L$ is read as the limit of $f(x)$ is equal to $L$ as $x$ approaches $c$ from the left i.e., for all $x$ sufficiently close to $c$, but less than $c$, the value of $f(x)$ can be made as close as we please to $L$.

## (ii) The Right Hand Limit

$\operatorname{Lim}_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x)=M$ is read as the limit of $f(x)$ is equal to $M$ as $x$ approaches $c$ from the right i.e., for all $x$ sufficiently close to $c$, but greater than $c$, the value of $f(x)$ can be made as close as we please to $M$.

Note: The rules for calculating the left-hand and the right-hand limits are the same as we studied to calculate limits in the preceding section.
