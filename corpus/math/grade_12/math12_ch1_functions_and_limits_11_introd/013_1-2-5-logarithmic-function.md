### 1.2.5 Logarithmic Function

If $x=a^{x}$, then $y=\log _{a} x$, where $a>0, a \neq 1$ is called Logarithmic Function of $x$.
(i) If $a=10$, then we have $\log _{10} x$ (written as $\lg x$ ) which is known as the common logarithm of $x$.
(ii) If $a=e$, then we have $\log _{e} x$ (written as $\ln x$ ) which is known as the natural logarithm of $x$.
