### 3. A circle passing through two points and equation of tangent at one of these points is known.

**Example 5:** Find an equation of the circle passing through the point (−2, −5) and touching the line 3*x* + 4*y* − 24 = 0 at the point (4, 3).

**Solution:** Let the circle be

$$
x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0 \tag{1}
$$

The points (−2, −5) and (4, 3) lie on it. Therefore

$$
-4g - 10f + c + 29 = 0 \tag{2}
$$

$$
8g + 6f + c + 25 = 0 \tag{3}
$$

The line

$$
3x + 4y - 24 = 0 \tag{4}
$$

Touches the circle at (4, 3).

A line through (4, 3) and perpendicular to (4) is

$$
y - 3 = \frac{4}{3} (x - 4) \quad \text{or} \quad 4x - 3y - 7 = 0
$$

This line being a normal through (4, 3) passes through the centre (−g, −f) of the circle (1). Therefore

$$
-4g + 3f - 7 = 0 \tag{5}
$$

From (2) − (3), we get

$$
-12g - 16f + 4 = 0
$$

or

$$
3g + 4f - 1 = 0 \tag{6}
$$

Solving (5) and (6), we have *g* = −1, *f* = 1. Inserting these values of *g* and *f* into (3), we find *c* = −23. Equation of the required circle is

$$
x^2 + y^2 - 2x + 2y - 23 = 0
$$
