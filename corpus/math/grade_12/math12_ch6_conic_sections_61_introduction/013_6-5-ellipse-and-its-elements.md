### 6.5 ELLIPSE AND ITS ELEMENTS

We have already stated that a conic section is an ellipse if $e<1$.
Let $0<e<1$ and $F$ be a fixed point and $L$ be a fixed line not containing $F$. Let $P(x, y)$ be a point in the plane and $|P M|$ be the perpendicular distance of $P$ from $L$.
The set of all points $P$ such that

$$
\left|\frac{P F}{P M}\right|=e
$$

is called an ellipse.
The number e is eccentricity of the ellipse, $F$ a focus and $L$ a directrix.
