#### **6.5.2 Graph of an Ellipse**

Let an equation of the ellipse be

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} > 1
$$

Since only even powers of both *x* and *y* occur in (1), the curve is symmetric with respect to both the axes.

From (1), we note that

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2} \leq 1 \text{ and } \frac{y^2}{b^2} \leq 1
$$

i.e.,

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2} \leq a^2 \text{ and } y^2 \leq b^2
$$

or

$$
-a \leq x \leq a \quad \text{ and } \quad -b \leq y \leq b
$$

Thus all points of the ellipse lie on or within the rectangle (2). The curve meets the *x*-axis at *A*<sup>0</sup> (*a*, 0) and *A'* (*a*, 0) and it meets the *y*-axis at *B*(0,−*b*), *B'* (0, *b*). The graph of the ellipse can easily be drawn as shown in the following figure.

The graph of the ellipse

$$
\frac{x^2}{b^2} + \frac{y^2}{a^2} = 1, \quad a > b
$$

can be sketched as in the case of (1). Its shape is shown in the above figure (ii).

# **Summary of Standard Ellipses**

|  Equation | $$ \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, a > b $$
$$ \frac{x^2}{b^2} + \frac{y^2}{a^2} = 1, a > b $$
$$ \frac{c^2 = a^2 - b^2}{c^2 = a^2 - b^2} = 1, a > b $$
$$ \frac{c^2 = a^2 - b^2}{c^2 = a^2 - b^2} = 1, a > b $$  |
| --- | --- |
|  Foci | (2c, 0)  |
|  Directrices | $$ x = \pm \frac{c}{e^2} $$  |
|  Major axis | $$ y = 0 $$  |
|  Vertices | (2a, 0)  |
|  Convertices | (0, +b)  |
|  Centre | (0, 0)  |
|  Eccentricity | $$ e = \frac{c}{a} \times 1 $$  |
|  Graph |   |
|  Note: In each ellipse | Length of major axis = 2a, Length of minor axis = 2b  |
|   | Length of Latusrectum = $$\frac{2b^2}{a}$$, Foci lie on the major axis  |

**Example 1.** Find an equation of the ellipse having centre at (0,0), focus at (0,–3) and one vertex at (0,4). Sketch its graph.

**Solution.** The second vertex has coordinates (0, –4). Length of the semi-major axis is

$$ a = 4 $$

Also

$$ c = 3 $$

From $$ b^2 = a^2 - c^2 $$, we have

$$ b^2 = 16 - 9 = 7 $$

$$ b = \sqrt{7} $$ which is length of the semi-minor axis. Since the foci lie on the y-axis; equation of the ellipse is

$$ \frac{y^2}{16} + \frac{x^2}{7} = 1 $$

The graph is as shown above.

**Example 2.** Analyze the equation

$$ 4x^2 + 9y^2 = 36 $$

and sketch its graph.

**Solution:** The given equation may be written as

$$ \frac{x^2}{a} + \frac{y^2}{a} = 1 $$

which is standard form of an ellipse. Semi-major axis $$ a = 3 $$ Semi-minor axis $$ b = 2 $$ From $$ b^2 = a^2 - c^2 $$, we have

$$ c^2 = b^2 - a^2 = 9 - 4 = 5 $$

or

$$ c = \pm \sqrt{5 $$

For

$$ F(-\sqrt{5}, 0), \quad F'(\sqrt{5}, 0); \quad \text{Vertices:} \quad A(-3, 0), A'(3, 0) $$

The graph is as shown above.

Example 3. Show that the equation

$$
9 x^{2}-18 x+4 y^{2}+8 y-23=0
$$

represents an ellipse. Find its elements and sketch its graph.

Solution: We complete the squares in (1) and it becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(9 x^{2}-18 x+9\right)+\left(4 y^{2}+8 y+4\right)-36=0 \\
& \text { or } \quad 9(x-1)^{2}+4(y+1)^{2}=36 \\
& \text { or } \quad \frac{(x-1)^{2}}{4}+\frac{(y+1)^{2}}{9}=1
\end{aligned}
$$

If we set $x-1=X, y+1=Y$ into (2), it becomes

$$
\frac{X^{2}}{2^{2}}+\frac{Y^{2}}{3^{2}}=1
$$

which is an ellipse with major axis along $X=0$ i.e., along the line, $x-1=0$ (i.e. a line parallel to the $y$-axis)

Semi-major axis $=3$, Semi-minor axis $=2$

$$
c=\sqrt{9-4}=\sqrt{5}, \text { Eccentricity }=-\frac{\sqrt{ }}{2}
$$

Centre of (2) is $X=0, Y=0$
or $x-1, y=-1$ i.e., $(1,-1)$ is centre of (1)
The foci of (2) are

$$
X=0, Y= \pm \sqrt{5}
$$

i.e., $x-1=0, y+1= \pm \sqrt{5}$
i.e., $(1,-1+\sqrt{5})$ and $(1,-1-\sqrt{5})$ are foci of (1).

$$
\begin{aligned}
& X=0, Y= \pm 3 \\

Example 4. An arch in the form of half an ellipse is 40 m wide and 15 m high at the centre. Find the height of the arch at a distance of 10 m from its centre.

Solution: Let the $x$-axis be along the base of the arch and the $y$-axis pass through its centre. An equation of the ellipse representing the arch is

$$
\frac{x^{2}}{20^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{15^{2}}=1
$$

Let the height of an arch at a distance of 10 m from the centre be $y$. Then the points $(10, y)$ lies on (1)

For $x=10$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{y^{2}}{15^{2}}=1-\frac{1}{4}=\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^{2} \\
& \text { so that } y=\frac{15 \sqrt{3}}{2} \\
& \text { Required height }=\frac{15 \sqrt{3}}{2} m
