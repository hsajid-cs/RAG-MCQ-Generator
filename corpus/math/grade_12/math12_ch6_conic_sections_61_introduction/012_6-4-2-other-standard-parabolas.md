### 6.4.2 Other Standard parabolas

There are other choices for the focus and directrix which also give standard equations of parabolas.
(i) If the focus lies on the $y$-axis with coordinates $F(0, a)$ and directrix of the parabola is $y=-a$, then equation of the parabola is

$$
x^{2}=4 a y
$$

The equation can be derived by difinition.
(ii) If the focus is $F(0,-a)$ and directrix is the line $y=a$, then equation of the parabola is

$$
x^{2}=-4 a y
$$

Opening of the parabola is upward in case of (3) and downward in case of (4). Both the curves are symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis.
The graphs of (3) and (4) are shown below.
(iii) If the focus of the parabola is $F(-a, 0)$, and its directrix is the line $x=a$, then equation of the parabola is

$$
y^{2}=-4 a x
$$

The curve is symmetric with respect to the $x$-axis and lies in the second and third quadrants only. Opening of the parabola is to the left as shown in the figure
## **6.4.3 Graph of the Parabola**

$$y^2 = 4ax$$

We note that corresponding to each positive value of *x* there are two equal and opposite values of *y*. Thus the curve is symmetric with respect to the *x*–axis. The curve passes through the origin and *x* = 0 is tangent to the curve at (0,0). If *x* is negative, then *y* is negative and so *y* is imaginary. Thus no portion of the curve lies on the left of the *y*–axis. As *x* increases, *y* also increases numerically so that the curve extends to infinity and lies in the first and fourth quadrants. Opening of the parabola is to the right of *y*–axis.

Sketching graphs of other standard parabolas is similar and is left as an exercise.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  **Equation** | $$y^2 = 4ax$$ | $$y^2 = -4ax$$ | $$x^2 = 4ay$$ | $$x^2 = -4ay$$  |
|  **Focus** | (a, 0) | (-a, 0) | (0, a) | (0, -a)  |
|  **Directrix** | *x* = *-a* | *x* = *a* | *y* = *-a* | *y* = *a*  |

**Example 1:** Analyze the parabola *x* = -16*y* and draw its graph.

**Solution.** We compare the given equation with *x* = -4*ay*

**Version:** 1.1

Here: - 4*a* = 16 or - *a* = 4.

The focus of the parabola lies on the *y*-axis and its opening is downward. Coordinates of the focus = (0, -4).

Equation of its axis is *x* = 0.

Length of the latusrectum is 16 and *y* = 0 is tangent to the parabola at its vertex. The shape of the curve is as shown in the figure.

**Example 2.** Find an equation of the parabola whose focus is *F* (-3, 4) and directrix is 3*x* - 4*y* + 5 = 0.

**Solution:** Let *P*(*x*, *y*) be a point on the parabola. Length of the perpendicular |*P*| from *P*(*x*, *y*) to the directrix 3*x* - 4*y* + 5 = 0 is

$$\left| \frac{3x - 4y + 5}{3^2 + (-4)^2} \right|$$

By definition, |*P*|=|*P*| or |*P*|^2 |*P*|^2

or

$$(x + 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = \frac{(3x - 4y + 5)^2}{25}$$

or

$$25(x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2 - 8y + 16) = 9x^2 + 16y^2 + 25 - 24xy + 30x - 40y$$

or

$$16x^2 + 24xy + 9y^2 + 120x - 160y + 600 = 0$$

is an equation of the required parabola.

**Example 3.** Analyze the parabola

$$x^2 - 4x - 3y + 13 = 0$$

and sketch its graph.

**Solution.** The given equation may be written as

$$x^2 - 4x + 4 = 3y - 9$$

or

$$(x - 2)^2 = 3(y - 3)$$

Let: - 2 = *X*, - *y* - 3 = *Y*

The equation (2) becomes *X* = 3*Y*

**Version:** 1.1

which is a parabola whose focus lies on $X=0$ and whose directrix is $Y=\frac{-3}{4}$ Thus coordinates of the focus of (3) are

$$
\begin{aligned}
& X=0, Y=\frac{-3}{4} \\
& \text { i.e., } \quad x-2=0-\quad \text { and } \quad y \quad 3 \quad \frac{3}{4} \\
& \text { or } \quad x=2, y=\frac{15}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus coordinates of the focus of the parabola
(1) are $\left(2, \frac{15}{4}\right)$

Axis of (3) is $X=0$ or $x-2=0$ is the axis of (1).
Vertex of (3) has coordinates

$$
\begin{aligned}
& X=0, Y=0 \\
& \text { or } \quad x-2=0, y-3=0
\end{aligned}
$$

i.e., $x=2, y=3$ are coordinates of the vertex of (1).

Equation of the directrix of (3) is
$Y=\frac{-3}{4}$ i.e. $y-3=\frac{-3}{4}$ or $y=\frac{9}{4}$ is an equation of the directrix of (1).
Magnitude of the latusrectum of the parabola (3) and also of (1) is 3.
The graph of (1) can easily be sketched and is as shown in the above figure.

Theorem: The point of a parabola which is closest to the focus is the vertex of the parabola.
Proof: Let the parabola be

$$
x^{2}=4 a y, a>0
$$

with focus at $F(0, a)$ and $P(x, y)$ be any point on the parabola.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& |P F|=\sqrt{x^{2}+(y-a)^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{4 a y+(y-a)^{2}} \\
& =y+a
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\text { version: } 1.1
$$

Since $y$ can take up only non-negative values, $|P F|$ is minimum when $y=0$. Thus $P$ coincides with $A$ so that of all points on the parabola, its vertex $A$ is closest to the focus.

Example 4. A comet has a parabolic orbit with the sun at the focus. When the comet is 100 million km from the sun, the line joining the sun and the comet makes an angle of $60^{\circ}$ with the axis of the parabola. How close will the comet get to the sun?

Solution. Let the sun $S$ be the origin. If the vertex of the parabola has coordinates $(-a, 0)$ then directrix of the parabola is

$$
x=-2 a, \quad(a>0)
$$

if the comet is at $P(x, y)$, then
by definition $|P S|=|P M|$
i,e., $x^{2}+y^{2}=(x+2 a)^{2}$
or $y^{2}=4 a x+4 a^{2}$ is orbit of the comet
Now $|P S|=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$

$$
=x+2 a=100,000,000
$$

The comet is closest to the sun when it is at $A$.
Now $\quad x=P S \cos 60^{\circ}$

$$
|x|=\frac{|P S|}{2}=\frac{x+2 a}{2}
$$

or $\quad \frac{x+2 a}{|x|}=\frac{2}{1} \quad$ or $\quad \frac{x+2 a}{2 a} \quad 2=,(|x| \quad|-2 a| \quad 2 a)$
or $\quad \frac{100,000,000}{2 a}=2$
or $\quad a=25,000,000$
Thus the comet is closest to the sun when it is $25,000,000 \mathrm{~km}$ from the sun.

## Reflecting Property of the parabola.

A frequently used property of a parabola is its reflecting property. If a light source is placed at the focus of a parabolic reflecting surface then a light ray travelling from $F$ to a point $P$ on the parabola will be reflected in the direction $P R$ parallel to the axis of the parabola.

The designs of searchlights, reflecting telescopes and microwave antenas are based on reflecting property of the parabola.

Another application of the parabola is in a Suspension bridge. The main cables are of parabolic shape. The total weight of the bridge is uniformly distributed along its length if the shape of the cables is parabolic. Cables in any other shape will not carry the weight evenly.

Example 6. A suspension bridge with weight uniformly distributed along the length has two towers of 100 m height above the road surface and are 400 m apart. The cables are parabolic in shape and are tangent to road surface at the centre of the bridge. Find the height of the cables at a point 100 m from the centre.

Solution. The parabola formed by the $P$ cables $(1,200,100)$ has $A(0,0)$ as vertex and focus on the $y$-axis. An equation of this parabola is $x^{2}=4 a y$.

The point $Q(200,100)$ lies on the parabola and so

$$
(200)^{2}=4 a \times 100
$$

or $\quad a=100$
Thus an equation of the parabola is

$$
x^{2}=400 y
$$

To find the height of the cables when $x=100$, we have from (1)

$$
(100)^{2}=400 y
$$

or $\quad y=25$
Thus required height $=25 \mathrm{~m}$
