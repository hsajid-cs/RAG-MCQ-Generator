### 6.5.1 Standard Form of an Ellipse

Let $F(-c, 0)$ be the focus and line $x=\frac{-c}{e^{2}}$ be the directix of an ellipse with eccentricity $e$, $(0<e<1)$. Let $P(x, y)$ be any point on the ellipse and suppose that $|P M|$ is the perpendicular distance of $P$ from the directrix. Then

$$
|P M|=x+\frac{c}{e^{2}}
$$

The condition $|P F|=e|P M|$ takes the analytic form

$$
(x+c)^{2}+y^{2}=e^{2}\left(x+\frac{c}{e^{2}}\right)^{2}
$$

$$
\text { or } \quad x^{2}+2 c x+c^{2}+y^{2}=e^{2} x^{2}+2 c x+\frac{c^{2}}{e^{2}} \quad \text { or } \quad x^{2}\left(4 e^{2}\right)+y^{2}=\frac{e^{2}}{e^{2}}\left(4 e^{2}\right)
$$

version: 1.1
or $\quad x^{2}\left(1-e^{2}\right)+y^{2}=a^{2}\left(1-e^{2}\right)$. where $\frac{c}{e} a$
or $\quad \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{a^{2}\left(1-e^{2}\right)}=1$
If we write $b^{2}=a^{2}\left(1-e^{2}\right)$, then (1) takes the form

$$
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1
$$

which is an equation of the ellipse in the standard form.
Moreover, eccentricity of the ellipse is $e=\frac{c}{a}$.
We have $b^{2}=a^{2}\left(1-e^{2}\right)$
(i) From the relation $b^{2}=a^{2}\left(1-e^{2}\right)$, we note that $b<a$
(ii) Since we set $\frac{c}{e}=a$, the focus $F$ has coordinates $(-a e, 0)$ and equation of the directrix is $x=\frac{-a}{e}$.
(iii) If we take the point $(a e, 0)$ as focus and the line $x=\frac{a}{e}$ as directrix, it can be seen easily that we again obtain equation (2). Thus the ellipse (2) has two foci $(-a e, 0)$ and $(a e, 0)$ and two directrices $x=\pm \frac{a}{e}$.
(iv) The point (acos $\theta$, bsin $\theta$ ) lies on (2) for all real $\theta . x=\operatorname{acos} \theta, y=b \sin \theta$ are called parametric equations of the ellipse (2).
(v) If in (2), $b=a$ then it becomes

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}
$$

which is a circle. In this case $b^{2}=a^{2}\left(1-e^{2}\right)=a^{2}$ and so $e=0$. Thus circle is a special case of an ellipse with eccenctricty 0 and foci tending to the centre.
Definitions: Let $F^{\prime}$ and $F$ be two foci of the ellipse

$$
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1
$$

- (i) The midpoint *C* of *FF'* is called the **centre** of the ellipse. In case of (1) coordinates of *C* are (0,0).
- (ii) The intersection of (1) with the line joining the foci are obtained by setting *y* = 0 into (1). These are the points *A*<sup>0</sup>(*a*, 0) and *A*(*a*, 0). The points *A* and *A'* are called **vertices** of the ellipse.
- (iii) The line segment *AA'* = 2*a* is called the **major axis** of the ellipse. The line through the centre of (1) and perpendicular to the major axis has its equation as *x* = 0. It meets (1) at points *B'* (0, *b*) and *B'* (0,−*b*). The line segment *BB'* = 2*b* is called the **minor axis** of the ellipse and *B'*, *B'* are some-times called the **covertices** of the ellipse. Since *b*<sup>2</sup> = *a*<sup>2</sup>(1 − *e*<sup>2</sup>) and *e* < 1, the length of the major axis is greater than the length of the minor axis. (See figure)
- (iv) Foci of an ellipse always lie on the major axis.
- (v) Each of the focal chords *LFL'* and *NF'N'* perpendicular to the major axis of an ellipse is called a **latusrectum** of the ellipse. Thus there are two **laterarecta** of an ellipse. It is an easy exercise to find that length of each latusrectum is *2b*<sup>2</sup> *a*. (See problem 5).
- (vi) If the foci lie on the *y*–axis with coordinates (0,−*ae*) and (0,∂*e*), then equation of the ellipse is

$$
\frac{x^2}{b^2} + \frac{y^2}{a^2} = 1. \quad a > b.
$$

The reader is urged to derive this equation.
