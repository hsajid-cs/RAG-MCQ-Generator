### 6.6 HYPERBOLA AND ITS ELEMENTS

We have already stated that a conic section is a hyperbola if $e>1$. Let $e>1$ and $F$ be a fixed point and $L$ be a line not containing $F$. Also let $P(x, y)$ be a point in the plane and $|P M|$ be the perpendicular distance of $P$ from $L$.

The set of all points $P(x, y)$ such that

$$
\frac{|P F|}{|P M|}=e>1
$$

is called a hyperbola.
$F$ and $L$ are respectively focus and directrix of the hyperbola $e$ is the eccentricity.
