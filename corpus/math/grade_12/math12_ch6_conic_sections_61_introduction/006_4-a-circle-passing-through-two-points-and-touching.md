### 4. A circle passing through two points and touching a given line.

**Example 6:** Find an equation of the circle passing through the points *A*(1, 2) and *B*(1, −2) and touching the line *x* + 2*y* + 5 = 0.

**Solution:** Let *O*(*h, k*) be the centre of the required circle. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
& |O A|=|O B|=\text { radius of the circle. } \\
& \text { i.e., } \quad(h-1)^{2}+(k-2)^{2}=(h-1)^{2}+(k+2)^{2} \\
& \text { or } 8 k=0 \quad \text { i.e., } k=0 \\
& \text { Hence }|O A|=|O B| \\
& =\sqrt{(h-1)^{2}+4}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now length of perpendicular from $(h, k)$ i.e., $(h, 0)$ to the line $x+2 y+5=0$ equals the radius of the circle and is given by

$$
\frac{|h+5|}{\sqrt{5}}
$$

Therefore, $\frac{|h+5|}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot|O A|=\sqrt{(h-1)^{2}+4}$
or $\frac{(h+5)^{2}}{5}=(h-1)^{2}+4$ or $4 h^{2}-20 h=0 \quad$ i.e., $h=0,5$
Thus centres of the two circles are at $(0,0)$ and $(5,0)$.
Radius of the first circle $=\sqrt{5} \quad$; Radius of the second circle $=\sqrt{20}$
Equations of the circles are

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
x^{2}+y^{2}=5 & \text { and } & (x-5)^{2}+y^{2}=20 \\
x^{2}+y^{2}=5 & \text { and } & x^{2}+y^{2}-10 x+5=0
\end{array}
$$
