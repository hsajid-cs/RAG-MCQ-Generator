### 2. A circle passing through two points and having its centre on a given line.

**Example 4:** Find an equation of the circle having the join of *A* (*x*₁, *y*₁) and *B* (*x*₂, *y*₂) as a diameter.

**Solution:** Since *AB* is a diameter of the circle, its midpoint is the centre of the circle. The radius of the circle is known and standard form of an equation of the circle may be easily written. However, a more elegant procedure is to make use of the plane geometry. If (*x*, *y*) is any point on the circle, then *m*⊥*APB* = 90°.

Thus the lines *AP* and *BP* are perpendicular to each other.

$$
\text{Slope of } \quad AP = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} \quad \text{and} \quad \text{Slope of } \quad BP \quad \frac{y - y_2}{x - x_2}
$$

By the condition of perpendicularity of two lines, we get

$$
\frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} \times \frac{y - y_2}{x - x_2} = 1
$$

or

$$
(x - x_1) (x - x_2) + (y - y_1)(y - y_2) = 0
$$

This is required equation of the circle.
