### 6.4.1 General Form of an Equation of a Parabola

Let $F(h, k)$ be the focus and the line $l x+m y+n=0$ be the directrix of a parabola. An equation of the parabola can be derived by the definition of the parabola. Let $P(x, y)$ be a point on the parabola. Length of the perpendicular $P M$ from $P(x, y)$ to the directrix is given by;

$$
|P M|=\frac{|l x+m y+n|}{\sqrt{l^{2}+m^{2}}}
$$

By definition, $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=\frac{(l x+m y+n)^{2}}{l^{2}+m^{2}}$
is an equation of the required parabola.
A second degree equation of the form

$$
a x^{2}+b y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0
$$

with either $a=0$ or $b=0$ but not both zero, represents a parabola. The equation can be analyzed by completing the square.
