### 6.6.1 Standard Equation of Hyperbola

Let $F(c, 0)$ be the focus with $c>0$ and $x=\frac{c}{c^{2}}$ be the directrix of the hyperbola. Also let $P(x, y)$ be a point on the hyperbola, then by definition

$$
\frac{|P F|}{|P M|}=e
$$

i.e. $(x-c)^{3}+y^{2}=e^{2}\left(x-\frac{c}{e^{2}}\right)^{2} \quad$ or $\quad x \frac{c}{e^{2}} \quad 2 c \neq \quad c \neq \quad y \frac{c}{e^{2}} \quad e^{2} x \frac{c}{e^{2}} \quad 2 c \neq \quad \frac{e^{2}}{a^{2}}$
or $\quad x^{2}\left(e^{2}-1\right)-y^{2}=c^{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{e^{2}}\right)=\frac{c^{2}}{e^{2}}\left(e^{2}-1\right)$
Let us set $a=\frac{c}{e}$, so that (2) becomes
$x^{2}\left(e^{2}-1\right)-y^{2}-a^{2}\left(e^{2}-1\right)=0-\quad$ or $\quad \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} \quad \frac{y^{2}}{a^{2}\left(e^{2}-1\right)} \quad 1$
or $\quad \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$
where $\quad b^{2}=a^{2}\left(e^{2}-1\right) \approx c^{2}-a^{2} \quad \because c=a e$
(3) is standard equation of the hyperbola.

It is clear that the curve is symmetric with respect to both the axes.
If we take the point $(-c, 0)$ as focus
and the line $x=\frac{-c}{e^{2}}$ as directrix, then it is easy to see that the set of all points $P(x, y)$ such that

$$
|P F|=e|P M|
$$

is hyperbola with (3) as its equation.
Thus a hyperbola has two foci and two directrices.

If the foci lie on the $y$-axis, then roles of $x$ and $y$ are interchanged in (3) and the equation of the hyperbola becomes

$$
\frac{y^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{x^{2}}{b^{2}}=1
$$

Definition: The hyperbola

$$
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1
$$

meets the $x$-axis at points with $y=0$ and $x= \pm a$. The points $A(-a, 0$ and $A \nmid a, 0)$ are called vertices of the hyperbola. The line segament $A A^{\prime}=2 a$ is called the transverse (or focal) axis of the hyperbola (3). The equation (3) does not meet the $y$-axis in real points. However the line segment joining the points $B(0,-b)$ and $B^{\prime}(0, b)$ is called the conjugate axis of the hyperbola. The midpoint $(0,0)$ of $A A^{\prime}$ is called the centre of the hyperbola.

In case of hyperbola (3), we have

$$
b^{2}=a^{2}\left(e^{2}-1\right)=c^{2}-a^{2} \text {. The eccentricity } e=\frac{c}{a}>1
$$

so that, unlike the ellipse, we may have $b>a$ or $b<a$ or $b=a$
(ii) The point ( $a$ sec $\theta, b$ tan $\theta$ ) lies on the hyperbola $\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$ for all real values of $\theta$. The equations $x=a \sec \theta, y=b \tan \theta$ are called parametric equations of the hyperbola.
(iii) Since $y= \pm \frac{b}{a} \sqrt{x^{2}-a^{2}}$, when $|x|$, so that $x^{2} \quad a^{2} \quad \Rightarrow$, we have

$$
y:=\frac{b}{a} \cdot x \quad \text { i.e. } \quad \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=0
$$

The lines (2) do not meet the curve but distance of any point on the curve from any of the two lines approaches zero. Such lines are called asymptotes of a curve. Joint equation of the asymptotes of (3) is obtained by writing 0 instead of 1 on the right hand side of the standard form (3). Asymptotes are very helpful in graphing a hyperbola.

The ellipse and hyperbola are called central conics because each has a centre of symmetry.
