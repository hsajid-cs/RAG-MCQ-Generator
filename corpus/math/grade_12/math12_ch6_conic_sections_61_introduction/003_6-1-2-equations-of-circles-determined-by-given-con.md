### 6.1.2 Equations of Circles Determined by Given Conditions

The general equation of a circle $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0$ contains three independent constants $g, f$ and $c$, which can be found if the equation satisfies three given conditions. We discuss different cases in the following paragraphs.

## 1. A Circle Passing Through Three Non-collincar Points.

If three non-collinear points, through which a circle passes, are known, then we can find the three independent constants $f, g$ and $c$ occurring in the general equation of a circle.

Example 3: Find an equation of the circle which passes through the points $A(5,10), B(6,9)$ and $C(-2,3)$.

Solution: Suppose equation of the required circle is

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0
$$

Since the three given points lie on the circle, they all satisfy (1). Substituting the three points into (1), we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 25+100+10 g+20 f+c=0 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad 10 g+20 f+c+125=0 \\
& 36+81+12 g+18 f+c+117=0 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad 12 g+18 f+c+117=0 \\
& 4+9-4 g+6 f+c=0 \\
& \quad-4 g+6 f+c+13=0
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we solve the equations (2), (3) and (4).
Subtracting (3) from (2), we have

$$
-2 g+2 f+8=0
$$

or

$$
g-f-4 = 0 \tag{5}
$$

Subtracting (4) from (2), we have.

$$
14g + 14f + 112 = 0 \tag{6}
$$

or

$$
g + f + 8 = 0 \tag{6}
$$

From (5) and (6), we have,

$$
f = -6 \text{ and } g = -2.
$$

Inserting the values of *f* and *g* into (2), we get *c* = 15

Thus equation of the circle is: *x*² + *y*² − 4*x* − 12*y* + 15 = 0
