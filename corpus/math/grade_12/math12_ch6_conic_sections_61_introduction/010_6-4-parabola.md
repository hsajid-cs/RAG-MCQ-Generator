### 6.4 PARABOLA

We have already stated that a conic section is a parabola if $e \equiv 1$.
We shall first derive an equation of a parabola in the standard form and study its important properties.

If we take the focus of the parabola as $F(a, 0), a>0$ and its directrix as line $L$ whose equation is $x \equiv-a$, then its equation becomes very simple.

Let $P(x, y)$ be a point on the parabola. So, by definition

$$
\frac{|P F|}{|P M|}=4 . \quad \text { or } \quad|P F||P M|
$$

Now $|P M|=x+a$
and $|P F|=\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+(y-0)^{2}}$
Substituting into (1), we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+y^{2}}=x+a \\
& (x-a)^{2}+y^{2}=(x+a)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

or

$$
y^{2}=(x+a)^{2}-(x-a)^{2}=4 a x \quad \text { or } \quad y^{2}=4 a x
$$

which is standard equation of the parabola.

## Definitions

(i) The line through the focus and perpendicular to the directrix is called axis of the parabola. In case of (2), the axis is $y=0$.
(ii) The point where the axis meets the parabola is called vertex of the parabola. Clearly the equation (2) has vertex $A(0,0)$. The line through $A$ and perpendicular to the axis of the parabola has equation $x=0$. It meets the parabola at coincident points and so it is a tangent to the curve at $A$.
(iii) A line joining two distinct points on a parabola is called a chord of the parabola. A chord passing through the focus of a parabola is called a focal chord of the parabola. The focal chord perpendicular to the axis of the parabola (1) is called latusrectum of the parabola. It has an equation $x=a$ and it intersects the curve at the points where

$$
y^{2}=4 a^{2} \quad \text { or } \quad y= \pm 2 a
$$

Thus coordinates of the end points $L$ and $L^{\prime}$ of the latusrectum are

$$
L(a, 2 a) \text { and } L^{\prime}(a,-2 a)
$$

The length of the latusrectum is $\left|L L^{\prime}\right|=4 a$.
(iv) The point $\left(a t^{2}, 2 a t\right)$ lies on the parabola $y^{2}=4 a x$ for any real $t$.

$$
x=a t^{2}, y=2 a t
$$

are called parametric equations of the parabola $y^{2}=4 a x$.
