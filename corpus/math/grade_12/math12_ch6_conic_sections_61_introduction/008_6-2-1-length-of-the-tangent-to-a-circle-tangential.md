### 6.2.1 Length of the tangent to a circle (Tangential Distance)

Let $P\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$ be a point outside the circle

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c \equiv 0
$$

We know that two real and distinct tangents can be drawn to the circle from an external point $P$. If the points of contact of these tangents with the circle are $S$ and $T$, then each of the length $P S$ and $P T$ is called length of the tangent or tangential distance from $P$ to the circle (1).

The centre of the circle has coordinates $(-g,-f)$. Join $P O$ and $O T$. From the right triangle $O P T$ we have,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { length of the tangent } & =\frac{|P T|}{\sqrt{O P^{2}-O T^{2}}} \\
& =\sqrt{\left(x_{i}+g\right)^{2}+\left(y_{i}+f\right)^{2}-\left(g^{2}+f^{2}-c\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$

version: 1.1

$$
=\sqrt{x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}+2 g x_{1}+2 f y_{1}+c}
$$

It is easy to see that length of the second tangent $\overrightarrow{P S}$ also equals (2).
Example 6: Find the length of the tangent from the point $P(-5,10)$ to the circle

$$
5 x^{2}+5 y^{2}+14 x+12 y-10=0
$$

Solution: Equation of the given circle in standard form is

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}+\frac{14}{5} x+\frac{12}{5} y-2=0
$$

Square of the length of the tangent from $P(-5,10)$ to the circle (1) is obtained by substituting -5 for $x$ and 10 for $y$ in the left hand member of (1)

$$
\therefore \quad \text { Required length } \quad=\sqrt{(-5)^{2}+(10)^{2}-14+24-2}=\sqrt{133}
$$

Example 7: Write equations of the tangent lines to the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}+4 x+2 y=0$ drawn from $P(-1,2)$. Also find the tangential distance.

Solution: An equation of the line through $P(-1,2)$ having slope $m$ is

$$
y-2=m(x+1) \text { or } \quad m x-y+m+2=0
$$

Centre of the circle is $C(-2,-1)$.

$$
\text { Radius }=\sqrt{4+1}=\sqrt{5}
$$

If (1) is tangent to the circle, then its distance from the centre of the circle equals the radius of the circle. Therefore

$$
\frac{[-2 m+1+m+2]}{\sqrt{m^{2}+1}}=\sqrt{5}
$$

or $\quad(-m+3)^{2}=5\left(m^{2}+1\right)$
or $\quad 4 m^{2}+6 m-4=0$ or $2 m^{2}+3 m-2=0$

$$
m=\frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9+16}}{4}=\frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}=-2, \frac{1}{2}
$$

Equations of the tangents are from equation (1)

$$
\text { version: } 1.1
$$

For $m=-2:-2 x-y=0$ or $2 x+y=0$
For $m=\frac{1}{2}: \frac{1}{2} x-y+\frac{5}{2}=0$ or $x-2 y+5=0$
Tangential distance $=\sqrt{1+4-4+4}=\sqrt{5}$
Example 8: Tangents are drawn from $(-3,4)$ to the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=21$. Find an equation of the line joining the points of contact (The line is called the chord of contact).

Solution: Let the points of contact of the two tangents be $P\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $Q\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$
An equation of the tangent at $P$ is

$$
x x_{1}+y y_{1}=21
$$

An equation of the tangent at $Q$ is

$$
x x_{2}+y y_{2}=21
$$

Since (1) and (2) pass through $(-3,4)$, so

$$
-3 x_{1}+4 y_{1}=21
$$

and $-3 x_{2}+4 y_{2}=21$
(3) and (4) show that both the points $P\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right), Q\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ lie on $-3 x+4 y=21$ and so it is the required equation of the chord of contact.
