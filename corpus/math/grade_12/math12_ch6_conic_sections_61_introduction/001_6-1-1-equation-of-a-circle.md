### 6.1.1 Equation of a Circle

The set of all points in the plane that are equally distant from a fixed point is called a circle. The fixed point is called the centre of the circle and the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle is called the radius of the circle.

If $C(h, k)$ is centre of a circle, $r$ its radius and $P(x, y)$ any point on the circle, then the circle, denoted $S(C ; r)$ in set notation is

$$
S(C ; r)=\{P(x, y) \mid \overline{C P} \mid r\}
$$

By the distance formula, we get

$$
|\overline{C P}|=\sqrt{(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}}=r
$$

or $\quad(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$
is an equation of the circle in standard form.
If the centre of the circle is the origin, then (1) reduces to

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}
$$

If $r=0$, the circle is called a point circle which consists of the centre only.

Let $P(x, y)$ be any point on the circle (2) and let the inclination of $O P$ be $\theta$ as shown in the figure. It is clear that

$$
\left.\begin{array}{l}
x=r \cos \theta \\
y=r \sin \theta
\end{array}\right\}
$$

The point $P(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta)$ lies on (2) for all values of $\theta$. Equations (3) are called parametric equations of the circle (2).

Example 1: Write an equation of the circle with centre $(-3,5)$ and radius 7.
Solution: Required equation is

$$
(x+3)^{2}+(y-5)^{2}=7^{2}
$$

or

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}+6 x-10 y-15=0
$$
