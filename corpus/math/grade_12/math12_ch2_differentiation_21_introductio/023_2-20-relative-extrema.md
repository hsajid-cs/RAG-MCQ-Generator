### 2.20 RELATIVE EXTREMA

Let $(c-\delta x, c+\delta x) \subseteq D_{c^{-}},($domain of a function $f)$, where $\delta x$ is small positive number.

If $f(c) \geq f(x)$ for all $x \in(c-\delta x, c+\delta x)$ then the function $f$ is said to have a relative maxima at $x=c$.

Similarly if $f(c) \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in(c-\delta x, c+\delta x)$, then the function $f$ has relative minima at $x=c$.

Both relative maximum and relative minimum are called in general relative extrema.

The graph of a function is shown in the adjoining figure. It has relative maxima at $x=b$ and $x=d$. But at $x=a$ and $x=c$, it has relative minima.

Note that the relative maxima at $x=d$ is not the highest point of the graph.
