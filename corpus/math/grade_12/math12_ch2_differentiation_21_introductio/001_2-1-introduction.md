### 2.1 INTRODUCTION

The ancient Greeks knew the concepts of area, volume and centroids etc. which are related to integral calculus. Later on, in the seventeenth century, Sir Isaac Newton, an English mathematician (1642-1727) and Gottfried Whilhelm Leibniz, a German mathematician, (1646-1716) considered the problem of instantaneous rates of change. They reached independently to the invention of differential calculus. After the development of calculus, mathematics became a powerful tool for dealing with rates of change and describing the physical universe.

## Dependent and Independent Variables

In differential calculus, we mainly deal with the rate of change of a dependent variable with respect to one or more independent variables. Now, we first explain the terms dependent and independent variables.

We usually write $y=\sigma^{f}(x)$ where $f(x)$ is the value of $f$ at $x \quad D_{y}$ (the domain of the function $f$ ). Let us consider the functional relation $v=f(x)=x^{2}+1$ (A)

For different values of $x \in D_{y}, f(x)$ or the expression $x^{2}+1$ assumes different values. For example; if $x=1,1.5,2$ etc., then

$$ \begin{aligned} & f(1)=(1)^{2}+1=2, f(1.5)=(1.5)^{2}+1=2.25+1=3.25 \ & f(2)=(2)^{2}+1=4+1=5 \end{aligned} $$

We see that for the change $1.5-1=0.5$ in the value of $x$, the corresponding change in the value of $y$ or $f(x)$ is given by $f(1.5)-f(1)=3.25-2=1.25$ It is obvious that the change in the value of the expression $x^{2}+1$ (or $f(x)$ ) depends upon the change in the value of the variable $x$. As $x$ behaves independently, so we call it the independent variable. But the behaviour of $y$ or $f(x)$ depends on the variable $x$, so we call it the dependent variable.

The change in the value of $x$ (positive or negative) is called the increment of $x$ and is denoted by the symbol $\delta x$ (read as delta $x$ ). The corresponding change in the dependent variable $y$ or $f(x)$ for the change $\delta x$ in the value of $x$ is denoted by $\delta y$ or $\delta f=f(x+\delta x)-f(x)$. version: 1.1

Usually the small changes in the values of the variables are taken as increments of variables. Note: In this Chapter we shall discuss functions of the form $y=f(x)$ where $x=D_{y}$ and is called an independent variable while $x$ is called the dependent variable.
