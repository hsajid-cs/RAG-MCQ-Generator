### 3.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM

The law of conservation of angular momentum states that if no external torque acts on a system, the total angular momentum of the system remains constant.

$$
L_{\text {sita }}=L_{1}+L_{2}+\ldots=\text { constant }
$$

The law of conservation of angular momentum is one of the fundamental principles of Physics. It has been verified from the cosmological to the sub microscopic level. The effect of the law of conservation of angular momentum is readily apparent if a single isolated spinning body alters its moment of inertia.

If a body of moment of inertia $I_{1}$ spinning with angular speed $\omega_{1}$ alters its moment of inertia to $I_{2}$, then its angular speed $\omega_{2}$ also changes so that its angular momentum remains constant.
Hence

$$
I_{1} \omega_{1}=I_{2} \omega_{2}
$$

The angular momentum is a vector quantity with direction along the axis of rotation. Hence, the direction of angular momentum along the axis of rotation also remains fixed. This is illustrated by the fact given below:

The axis of rotation of an object will not change its orientation unless an external torque causes it to do so.

## If you try to sit on a bike at rest, it fails. But if the bike is moving, the angular momentum of the spinning wheel resists any tendency to change and heips to keep the bike upright and stable.
The ball's speed increases as the string wraps around the finger.

This fact is of great importance for the Earth as it moves around the Sun. No other sizeable torque is experienced by the Earth, because the major force acting on it is the pull of the Sun. The Earth's axle of rotation, therefore, remains fixed in one direction with reference to the universe around us.

# Examples of conservation of angular momentum

Aman diving from a diving board
A diver jumping from a springboard has to take a few someraaults in air before touching the water surface, as shown in Fig.3.19. After leaving the springboard, he curls his body by rolling arms and legs in. Due to this, his moment of inertia decreases, and he spins in midair with a large angular velocity. When he is about to touch the water surface, he stretches out his arms and legs. He enters the water at a gentle speed and gets a smooth dive. This is an example of the law of conservation of angular momentum.

## The spinning ice skater

An ice skater as shown in Fig. 3.20 can increase his angular velocity by folding arms and bringing the stretched leg close to the other leg. By doing so, he decreases his moment of inertia. As a result, angular speed increases. When he stretches his hands and a leg outward, the moment of inertia increases and hence angular velocity decreases.

## A person holding some weight in his hands standing on a turntable.

A person is standing on a turntable with heavy mass (dumb-bell) in his hands stretohed out on both sides as shown in Fig. 3.21. As he draws his hands inward, his

Man with masses in his hands on a turntable. Conservation of angular momentum requires that as the man pulls his arms in, the angular velocity increases.

## It has been noticed that when ice on the polar caps of Earth melts and water flows away in the form of river; the moment of inertia of water and hence that of Earth about its axis of rotation increases due to conservation of angular momentum. Hence, the angular velocity of Earth will decrease, therefore, the duration of day increases slightly.

angular speed at once increases. This is because the moment of inertia decreases on drawing the hands inwards, which increases the angular speed.

# Flywheel

Flywheel is a mechanical device which consists of a heavy wheel with an axle (Fig. 3.22). It is used to store rotational energy, smooth out output fluctuations and provides stability in a wide range of applications such as bicycles and other vehicles, industrial machinery, gyroscopes, ships and spacecrafts.

## The flywheel called the balance wheel regulates the time keeping mechanism in mechanical clocks and watches by maintaining controlled oscillations rate.

Fig. 3.22: A flywheel
When a fly wheel spins, its angular momentum resists changes to its orientations, maintaining stability. This is useful in systems that need precise control over their orientation without external interference.

## The Gyroscope

Agyroscope is a device which is used to maintain its orientation relative to the Earth's axis or resists changes in its orientation. It consists of a mounted flywheel pivoted in supporting rings as shown in Fig. 3.23. It works on the basis of law of conservation of angular momentum due to its large moment of inertia. When the gyroscope spins at a large angular speed, it gains large angular momentum. It is then difficult to change the orientation of the gyroscope's rotational axis due to its large moment of inertia. A change in orientation requires a change in its angular momentum. To change the direction of a large angular momentum, a corresponding large torque is required. Even if gyroscope is tilted (Fig. 3.24), it still keeps levitated without falling. Hence, it is a reason why a gyroscope can be used to maintain orientation. The

main applications of gyroscope are in the guiding system of aeroplanes, submarines and space vehicles in order to maintain a specific direction in space to keep steady course.

Planets move around the Sun in elliptical orbits with Sun situated at one of its foci, thus, distance of a planet from the Sun is not constant when it is nearer the Sun. Its orbital velocity increases automatically. Why?
