### 1.6 ASSESSMENT OF TOTAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINAL RESULT

Knowing the uncertainties in all the factors involved in a calculation, the maximum possible uncertainty or error in the final result can be found as follows:
We use many devices to measure physical quantities, such as length, time, and temperature. They all have some limit of precision.
These are not decoration pieces of glass but are the earliest known exquisite and sensitive thermometers, built by the Accademia del Cimento (16671667), in Florence. They contained alcohol, some times coloured red for easier reading.

# 1. For addition and Subtraction

Absolute uncertainties are added. For example, the distance between two positions $x=15.4 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $x_{1}=25.6 \mathrm{~cm} \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$ is recorded as:
$x=x_{2}-x_{1}=10.2 \pm 0.2 \mathrm{~cm}$
and addition of two lengths is:
$t_{1}=8.5 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $t_{2}=12.6 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$ recorded as:
$t=t_{1}+t_{2}=21.1 \pm 0.2 \mathrm{~cm}$

## 2. For multiplication and division

For your information
Colour printing uses just four colours cyan, magenta, yellow and black to produce the entire range of colours. All the colours in this book have been made from just these four colours.

Percentage uncertainties are added. For example, the maximum possible uncertainty in the value of resistance $R$ of a conductor determined by the potential difference $V$ applied across the conductor resulting in current flowing through it is estimated as under:

Let

$$
\begin{aligned}
V & =3.4 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~V} \\
I & =0.68 \pm 0.05 \mathrm{~A} \\
R & =\frac{V}{I}
\end{aligned}
$$

using
Percentage uncertainty in $V=\frac{0.1 \mathrm{~V}}{3.4 \mathrm{~V}} \times 100 \%=3 \%$
Percentage uncertainty in $I=\frac{0.05 \mathrm{~A}}{0.58 \mathrm{~A}} \times 100 \%=7 \%$

## Thumb Rule for Total Uncertainty

- For addition and subtraction: Absolute uncertainties are added.
- For multiplication and division: Percentage uncertainties are added.
- For power factor: Power factor $x$ Percentage uncertainty

Hence, total percentage uncertainty in the value of $R$ is $3+7=10 \%$
The value of $R$ will be written as:

$$
R=\frac{3.4 \mathrm{~V}}{0.68 \mathrm{~A}}=5.0 \mathrm{ohm}
$$

Hence, $R=5.0 \pm 0.5$ ohms, uncertainty being an estimate only, is recorded by one significant figure.

## 3. For Power Factor

|  |  |
| :--: | :--: |
|  |  |

The percentage uncertainty is multiplied by the power factor in the formula. For example, the calculation of cross-sectional area of a cylinder of radius $r=1.25 \mathrm{~cm}$ using formula for Area $A=\pi r^{2}$ is given by the \%age uncertainty which is $A=2 \times \%$ age uncertainty in radius $r$. As uncertainty is multiplied by power factor, it increases the precision demand of measurement. When the radius of a small sphere is measured as 1.25 cm by Vernier Callipers with least count 0.01 cm , then
The radius ris recorded as

$$
r=1.25 \pm 0.01 \mathrm{~cm}
$$

\%age uncertainty in radius ris

$$
r=\frac{0.01}{1.25} \times 100 \%=0.8 \%
$$

Total percentage uncertainty in area $A=2 \times 0.8=1.6 \%$
Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
A & =\pi r^{2} \\
& =3.14(1.25)^{2}=4.906 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \text { with } 1.8 \% \text { uncertainty }
\end{aligned}
$$

# Physica II

Thus, the result should be recorded as $A=4.91 \pm 0.08 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$
Example 7.1 The length, breadth and thickness of a metal sheet are $2.03 \mathrm{~m}, 1.22 \mathrm{~m}$ and 0.95 cm respectively. Calculate the volume of the sheet correct up to the appropriate significant digits.

Solution Given Length
Breadth
Thickness
Volume

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell & =2.03 \mathrm{~m} \\
b & =1.22 \mathrm{~m} \\
h & =0.95 \mathrm{~cm}=0.95 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} \\
V & =\ell \times b \times h=2.03 \mathrm{~m} \times 1.22 \mathrm{~m} \times 0.95 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m} \\
& =2.35277 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

As the factor 0.95 cm has minimum number of significant figures equal to two, therefore, volume is recorded up to 2 significant figures, hence, $V=2.4 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
Example 7.2 The mass of a metal box measured by a lever balance is 3.25 kg . Two silver coins of masses 10.01 g and 10.02 g measured by a beam balance are added to it. What is now the total mass of the box correct up to the appropriate precision?

## Solution

Total mass when silver coins are added to box $=3.25 \mathrm{~kg}+0.01001 \mathrm{~kg}+0.01002 \mathrm{~kg}$ $=3.27003 \mathrm{~kg}$
Since least precise mass is 3.25 kg , having two decimal places, hence, total mass should be reported to 2 decimal places which is the appropriate precision.
Thus
Total mass $=3.27 \mathrm{~kg}$
Example 7.3 The diameter and length of a metal cylinder measured with the help of Vernier Callipers of least count 0.01 cm are 1.25 cm and 3.35 cm , respectively. Calculate the volume $V$ of the cylinder and uncertainty in it.

Solution Given
Diameter
Length
Absolute uncertainty in length
\%age uncertainty in length
Absolute uncertainty in diameter
\%age uncertainty in diameter
As Volume

$$
d=1.25 \mathrm{~cm} \text { with least count } 0.01 \mathrm{~cm}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell & =3.35 \mathrm{~cm} \text { with least count } 0.01 \mathrm{~cm} \\
& =0.01 \mathrm{~cm} \\
& =(0.01 \mathrm{~cm} / 3.35 \mathrm{~cm}) \times 100 \%=0.3 \% \\
& =0.01 \mathrm{~cm} \\
& =(0.01 \mathrm{~cm} / 1.25 \mathrm{~cm}) \times 100 \%=0.8 \% \\
& =\pi r^{2} \ell=\pi \frac{d^{2}}{4} \ell
\end{aligned}
$$

Total uncertainty in $V=2$ (\%age uncertainty in diameter) + (\%age uncertainty in length) $=2 \times 0.8 \%+0.3 \%=1.9 \%$
Then
Thus

$$
V=3.14 \times(1.25 \mathrm{~cm})^{2} \times 3.35 \mathrm{~cm} / 4=4.1089842 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \text { with } 1.9 \% \text { uncertainty }
$$

$V=(4.11 \pm 0.08) \mathrm{cm}^{3}$
where $4.11 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ is calculated volume and $0.08 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ is the uncertainty in it.

# 1.7 DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES

Any physical quantity can be described by certain familiar properties such as length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, etc. These measurable properties are called dimensions. Dimensions deal with the qualitative nature of a physical quantity in terms of fundamental quantities. The quantities such as length, depth, height, diameter, light year are all measured in metre and denoted by the same dimension, basically known as length given by symbol $L$ written within square brackets [L]. Similarly, the other fundamental quantities, mass, time, electric current and temperature are denoted by specific symbols [M], [T], [A] and [6], respectively. These five dimensions have been chosen as being basic because they are easy to measure in experiments.
The dimensions of other quantities indicate how they are related to the basic quantities and are combination of fundamental dimensions. For example, speed $v$ is measured in metres per second, so it has the dimensions of length [L] divided by time [T].

$$
[v]=[L] /[T]=[L]\left[T^{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2}\right]
$$

As the acceleration $a=\Delta v / \Delta t$
Dimensions of acceleration are

$$
[a]=[v] /[T]=\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2}\right] /[T]=\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2}\right]
$$

Also, dimensions of force can be written as

$$
[F]=[m][a]=[M]\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\right]
$$

By the use of dimensionality, we can check the homogeneity (correctness) of a physical equation, and also, we can derive formula for a physical quantity.

## Homogeneity of Physical Equations

The correctness of an equation can be checked by showing that the dimensions of quantities on both sides of the equation are the same. This is known as principle of homogeneity.
Suppose a car starts from rest $\left(v_{i}=0\right)$ and covers a distance $S$ in time $t$ moving with an acceleration a. The
The ceslum atomic frequency standard at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Colorado (USA). It is the primary standard for the unit of time.

equation of motion is given by,

$$
S=v_{1} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

or

$$
S=\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

Numerical factors like $1 / 2$ have no dimensions, so they can be ignored. By putting the dimensions of both sides of the equation:

$$
[S]=[a]\left[t^{2}\right]
$$

Writing the symbols of dimensions $[L]=\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{T}^{2}\right]$

$$
[L]=\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{2}\right]
$$

or

$$
[L]=[L]
$$

This shows that dimensions on both sides of equation are the same, therefore, the equation is dimensionally correct.

# Derivation of a Formula

Dimensionality can be used to derive a possible formula for a phyaical quantity by correct estimation of various factors on which the quantity depends.
The davice which made the pendulum clock practicai.

Example 1.4 Derive a formula for the centripetal force required to keep an object moving along a circle with uniform speed. Assuming that centripetal force depends on mass of the object, radius of the circle and uniform speed.
Solution As force depends on mass $m$ of the object, radius $r$ of the circle and uniform speed $v$, we can write:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F a m^{2} v^{2} r^{2} \\
& F=\left(\text { constant }\right) m^{2} v^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

where the exponents (powers) $a, b$ and $c$ are to be determined. By the principle of homogeneity, the dimensions on both sides of the equation should be the same. Since, constant has no dimension so by ignoring it, we write the above equation in terms of dimensions as,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& {[F]=\left[m^{2}\right]\left[v^{2}\right]\left[r^{2}\right]} \\
& {\left[\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{M}^{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{T}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{~L}^{2}\right]} \\
& {\left[\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{M}^{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{LT}^{-1}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{~L}^{2}\right]} \\
& {\left[\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{M}^{2} \mathrm{~L}^{2-2} \mathrm{~T}^{2}\right]}
\end{aligned}
$$

Comparing the powers of dimensions on both sides of the above equation, we have

$$
a=1
$$

## Bevare!

Calculators are designed to yield as many digits as the memory of the calculator chip permits. Hence, be sure to round off the final answers of calculations down to correct number of significant figures.

$$
\begin{aligned}
b+c & =1 \\
-b & =-2
\end{aligned}
$$

Solving the above equations, we have $a=1, b=2, c=-1$
Putting the values of $a, b$ and $c$ in equation (i), we have

$$
F=(\text { constant }) m v^{2} r^{1}
$$

or

$$
F=(\text { constant }) m v^{2} / r
$$

The numerical value of the constant cannot be determined by dimensional analysis. However, it can be found by experiments. In the above equation, numerical value of the constant happens to be " 1 ", so the equation reduces to:

$$
F=m v^{2} / r
$$

# Limitations in Dimensional Analysis

The dimensional method cannot identify where an equation is wrong. Even if an equation is proved correct, we can only say the equation might be correct, for the reason that the method does not provide a check on any numerical factor or constant. That can only be determined by experiments or plotting some suitable graph between the variables.
