### 1.2 INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS

In 1960, an international committee agreed on a set of definitions and standards to describe the physical quantities. The system that was established is called the System International (SI).
SI units are used by the world's scientific community and by almost all nations. The system International (SI) consists of two kinds of units: base units and derived units.

## Base Units

There are seven base units for physical quantities namely: length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, light or luminous intensity and amount of substance (with special reference to the number of particles). Prefixes such as milli, micro, kilo, etc. may be used with them to express smaller or larger quantities.

Table 1.1

| Physical <br> Quantity | SI Unit | Symbol |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Length | mste | m |
| Mass | kilogram | kg |
| Time | second | s |
| Electric <br> current | ampere | A |
| Thermodynamic <br> temperature | kelvin | K |
| Intensity of <br> light | candela | cd |
| Amount of <br> substance | mole | mol |

The names of base units for these physical quantities together with symbols are listed in Table 1.1.

# Derived Units

Derived units are those units which depend on the base units. Some of the derived units are given in Table. 1.2. The units of plane angle and solid angle have also been included in the list of derived units since 1995.
In addition to base and derived units, the SI permits the use of certain additional units, including:

| Table 1.2 |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Physical quantity | Unit | Symbol | In terms of base units |
| Plane angle | radian | rad | dimensionless |
| Solid angle | steradian | sr | dimensionless |
| Force | newton | N | $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m} \mathrm{s}^{-2}$ |
| Work | joule | J | $\mathrm{Nm}=\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ |
| Power | watt | W | $\mathrm{J} \mathrm{s}^{-1}=\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ |
| Electric charge | coulomb | C | As |
| Pressure | pascal | Pa | $\mathrm{Nm}^{-2}=\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ |

- The traditional mathematical units for measuring angles (degree, arcminute, and arcsecond).
- The traditional units for standard time are (minute, hour, day, and year).
- The logarithmic units bel (and its multiples, such as the decibel).
- Two metric units commonly used in ordinary life: the litre for volume and the tonne (metric ton) for large masses.
- Two non-metric scientific units are atomic mass unit ( $\mu$ ) and the electron volt (eV).
- The nautical mile and knot; units traditionally used at sea and in meteorology.
- The acre and hectare, common metric units of land area.
- The bar is a unit of pressure and it is commonly used as the millibar in meteorology and the kilobar in engineering.
- The angstrom and the bam, units used in physics and astronomy.

## Scientific Notation

Numbers are expressed in standard form called scientific notation, which employs powers of ten. The internationally accepted practice is that there should be only one non-zero digit left of decimal. Thus, the number 134.7 should be written as $1.347 \times 10^{2}$ and 0.0023 be expressed as $2.3 \times 10^{-3}$.
# Prefixes

Most prefixes indicate order of magnitude in steps of 1000 and provide a convenient way to express large and small numbers, to eliminate non-significant digits. SI also includes four of the other prefixes to accommodate usage already established before the introduction of SI (Table 1.3). They are centi- $\left(10^{-3}\right)$, deci- $\left(10^{-4}\right)$, deca- $\left(10^{1}\right)$ and hecto- $\left(10^{2}\right)$.

## Conventions for Using SI Units

Use of SI units requires special care, more particularly in writing prefixes. Some points to note are:

1. Each SI unit is represented by a symbol not an abbreviation. These symbols are the same in all languages. Hence, correct use of the symbol is very important.
For example: For ampere, we should use "A" not "amp"; for seconds, "s" not "sec", SI not S.I.
2. Full name of unit does not begin with capital letter. For example: newton, metre, etc., except Celsius.
3. Symbols appear in lower case.

For example: "m" for metre, "s" for second, etc., exception "L" for litre.
4. Symbols named after scientists have initial letters capital.
For example: "N" for newton, "Pa" for pascal, "W" for watt.
5. Symbols and prefixes are printed in upright (roman) style regardless of the type style in surrounding text.
For example: a distance of 50 m .
6. Symbols do not take plural form.

For example: $1 \mathrm{~mm}, 100 \mathrm{~mm}, 1 \mathrm{~kg}, 60 \mathrm{~kg}$.
7. No fullstop or dot is placed after the symbol except at the end of the sentence.
8. Prefix is written before and without space to base unit. For example: "mL" not mL or "ms" not m s.
9. Base units are written one space apart. Leave a space even between the number (value) and the symbol. For example: $1 \mathrm{~kg}, 10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$, etc.

Approximate Values of Some Time Intervals

## Mass can be thought of as a form of energy. In effect, the mass is highly concentrated form of energy. Einstein's famous equation, Ennac ${ }^{2}$ means:

Energy $=$ mass $x$ (speed of light) ${ }^{2}$
According to this equation 1 kg mass is actually $9 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~J}$ of energy.

10. Compound prefixes are not allowed:

For example: $1 \mu \mu \mathrm{~F}$ should be 1 pF .
11. When base unit of multiple is raised to a power, the power applies to whole multiple and not to base unit alone.
For example: $1 \mathrm{~km}^{2}=1(\mathrm{~km})^{2}=1 \times\left(10^{3} \mathrm{~m}\right)^{2}=1 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.
12. Use negative index notation ( $\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$ ) instead of solidus ( $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ ).
13. Use scientific notation, that is, one non-zero digit left of decimal.

For example: $143.7=1.437 \times 10^{2}$.
14. Do not mix symbols and names in the same expression.

For example: metre per second or $\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$, notmetre/sec or $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}$ ond.
15. Practical work should be recorded in most convenient units depending upon the instruments being used.
For Example: Measurements using screw gauge should be recorded in mm but the final results must be recorded to the appropriate base units.
16. System International do not allow the use of former CGS System units such as dyne, erg, gausa, poise, torr, etc.

# 1.3 UNCERTAINTY IN MEASUREMENT

You can count the number of pages of a book exactly but measurement of its length needs some measuring instrument. Every instrument is calibrated to a certain smallest division mark on it and this fact puts a limit regarding its accuracy. When you take a reading with one instrument, its limit of measurement is the smallest division or graduation on its scale. Hence, every measured quantity has some uncertainty aboutits value. When a measurement is made, it is taken to the nearest graduation or marking on the scale. You can estimate the maximum uncertainty as being one smallest division of the instrument. This is called absolute uncertainty. It is one millimetre on a metre rule that is graduated in millimetres. For example, if one edge of the book coincides with 10.0 cm mark and the other with 33.5 cm , then the length with uncertainty is given by

$$
(33.5 \pm 0.05) \mathrm{cm}-(10.0 \pm 0.05) \mathrm{cm}=(23.5 \pm 0.1) \mathrm{cm}
$$

It means that the true length of the book is in between 23.4 cm and 23.6 cm . Hence, the maximum uncertainty is $\pm 0.05 \mathrm{~cm}$, which is equivalent to an uncertainty of 0.1 cm . Infact, it is equal to least count of the metre rule. Uncertainty may be recorded as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Fractional uncertainty }=\frac{\text { Absolute uncertainty }}{\text { Measured value }} \\
& \text { or } \quad \text { Percentage uncertainty }=\frac{\text { Absolute uncertainty }}{\text { Measured value }} \times 100 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

## Uncertainty in Digital Instruments

Some modern measuring instruments have a digital scale. We usually estimate one

digit beyond what is certain: with a digital scale, this is reflected in some fluctuations of the last digit. If the last digit fluctuates by 1 or 2 , write down that last digit. If fluctuation is more than 2 or so in the last digit, it may mean that the reading is being influenced by some factor such as air currents. Regardless of the reason, a large fluctuation may mean that the displayed digit is not really significant.
The indication of uncertainty in a recorded value has been simplified using significant figures. If a measurement is recorded using the knowledge of significant figures, then its last digit, which is an estimation, is an indication of the accuracy of the recorded value.
