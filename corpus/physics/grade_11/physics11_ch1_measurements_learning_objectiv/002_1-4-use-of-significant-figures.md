### 1.4 USE OF SIGNIFICANT FIGURES

The number of digits of a measurement about which we do feel reasonably sure are called significant figures. Infact, they reflect the use of actual instrument used for that measurement. While using a calculator, the result of any calculation contains many digits after the decimal point. The additional digits may mislead another person who uses those figures into believing them. Hence, they are to be rounded off to the correct number of significant figures. This can be done by keeping in view the uncertainty or the least count of the instrument while recording observations and also quoting results of any calculations to the correct numbers of significant figures. It is better to quote the result in scientific notation to avoid any ambiguity regarding the number of significant figures.
For example, weighing the same object with different balances:
Electronic balance: mass $=3.145 \pm 0.001 \mathrm{~g}$
Usually, the uncertainty $\pm 0.001 \mathrm{~g}$ or $\pm 0.1 \mathrm{~g}$ is dropped, and it is understood that the number quoted has an uncertainty of at least 1 unit in the last digit. All digits which are quoted are called significant figures.

In any measurement, the accurately known digits and the first estimated or doubtful digit are called significant figures.
Proper use of significant figures ensures that we correctly represent the uncertainty of our measurements. For example, scientists immediately realize that the reported mass 3.145 g is more accurate than a reported mass of 3.1 g , reflecting the use of a better or more precise instrument. As we improve the quality of our measuring instrument and techniques, we extend the result to more and more significant figures and

correspondingly improve the experimental accuracy of the result.

## Working with significant figures

## (i) Counting significant digits

(a) All digits $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ are significant. However, zeros may or may not be significant. In case of zeros, the following rules may be adopted:
(b) Azero between two significant figures is itself significant.
(c) Zeros to the left most significant figure are not significant. For example, none of the zeros in 0.00467 or 02.59 are significant.
(d) Zeros to the right of a significant figure may or may not be significant. In decimal fraction, zeros to the right of a significant figure are significant. For example, all the zeros in 3.570 or 7.4000 are significant. However, in integers such as $8,000 \mathrm{~kg}$, the number of significant zeros is determined by the precision of the measuring instrument. If the measuring scale has a least count of 1 kg , then there are four significant figures written in scientific notation as $8.000 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~kg}$. If the least count of the scale is 10 kg , then the number of significant figures will be 3 written in scientific notation as $8.00 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}$ and so on.
(e) When a measurement is recorded in scientific notation or standard form, the figures other than the powers of ten are significant figures. For example, a measurement recorded as $8.70 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}$ has three significant figures.

## (ii) Multiplying or dividing numbers

Keep a number of significant figures in the product or quotient not more than that contained in the least accurate factor i.e., the factor containing the least number of significant figures. For example, the computation of the following using a calculator, gives

$$
\frac{5.348 \times 10^{-2} \times 3.64 \times 10^{4}}{1.336}-1.45768982 \times 10^{3}
$$

As the factor $3.64 \times 10^{4}$, the least accurate in the above calculation has three significant figures, the answer should be written to three significant figures only. The other figures are insignificant and should be deleted. While deleting the figures, the last significant figure to be retained is rounded off for which the following rules are followed:

Remember Thumb Rule
For calculation of end result:

- Addition / Subtraction: same precision.
- Multiplication/Division: same accuracy (Same number of significant figures).
(a) If the first digit dropped is less than 5 , the last digit retained should remain unchanged.
(b) If the first digit dropped is more than 5 , the digit to be retained is increased by one.
(c) If the digit to be dropped is 5 , the previous digit which is to be retained is increased by one if it is odd and retained as such if it is even. For example, the following numbers are rounded off to three significant figures as follows. The digits are deleted one by one.

| Physica II |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 43.75 | is rounded off as | 43.8 |
| 56.8546 | is rounded off as | 56.9 |
| 73.650 | is rounded off as | 73.6 |
| 64.350 | is rounded off as | 64.4 |

Following this rule, the correct answer of the computation given in section (ii) is $1.46 \times 10^{5}$.

## (iii) In adding or subtracting numbers

The number of decimal places retained in the answer should be equal to the smallest number of decimal places in any of the quantities being added or subtracted. In this case, the number of significant figures is not important. It is the position of decimal that matters. For example, suppose we wish to add the following quantities expressed in metres.
(a) 72.1
(b) 2.7543
3.42
4.10
0.003
1.273
75.523
8.1273
Correct answer: 75.5 m
8.13 m

## Thumb Rule for Uncertainty

For average value of many readings:

- Mean deviation from an average value.
- Periodic Uncertainty:

Divide least count of timing device by the number of oscillations.

## Cunich Oude

1. Give the correct number of significant figures for $0.0054 \mathrm{~m}, 0.03030 \mathrm{~m}$, $40.0 \mathrm{~m}, 0.6 \mathrm{~m}, 8.20 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m}$.
2. Give the answer to the appropriate number of significant figures.
$2602 \mathrm{~kg}+36.02 \mathrm{~kg}+54.1 \mathrm{~kg}=$ ?
3. Give the answer to the appropriate number of significant figures.
$3.54 \mathrm{~kg}-2.4 \mathrm{~kg}=$ ?
4. Give the answer to the appropriate number of significant figure.
$2.45 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~m} \times 2.46 \mathrm{~m} / 3.6 \mathrm{~m}=$ ?

In case (a), the number 72.1 has the smallest decimal places, thus the answer is rounded off to the same position which is then 75.5 m . In case (b), the number 4.10 has the smallest number of decimal places and hence, the answer is rounded off to the same decimal position which is then 8.13 m .

## Limitations of Significant Figures

Significant figures deal with only one source of uncertainties that inherent in reading the scale. Real experimental uncertainties have many contributions, including personal errors and sometimes hidden systematic errors. One cannot do better than that what the scale reading allows, but the total uncertainty may well be more than what the significant figure of the measurements would suggest.
