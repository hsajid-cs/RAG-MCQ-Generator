### 8.1 POLARIZATION OF LIGHT

Physical optics with reference to polarization deals with the behaviour of light waves and their interaction with matter.
Interference and diffraction effects prove the wave nature of light. These phenomena, however, do not tell us whether the light waves are longitudinal or transverse. Polarization of light suggests that the light waves are transverse in character.

In transverse mechanical waves, such as produced in a stretched string, the vibrations of the particles of the medium are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the waves. The vibrations can be confined along vertical, horizontal or any other direction (Fig. 8.1). In each of these cases, the transverse mechanical wave is said to be

polarized. The plane of polarization is the plane containing the direction of vibration of the particles of the medium and the direction of propagation of the wave.
A light wave produced by oscillating charge consists of a periodic variation of the electric field vector $E$ accompanied by the magnetic field vector $B$ at right angles to it. Ordinary light has components of vibration in all possible planes. Such a light is unpolarized. On the other hand, if the vibrations are confined only in one plane, the light is said to be polarized. Unpolarized light is shownin Fig. 8.2.
Examples of unpolarized light sources are sunlight, incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent light bulbs, light from a candle or fire.
Fig. 8.2: An unpolarized light, due to incandescent bulb, has vibrations in all planes.

Polarization is the process by which the electric and magnetic vibrations of light waves are restricted to a single plane of vibration. It is the property exhibited only by transverse waves such as light waves. It does not occur for longitudinal waves such as sound waves.

# How an Unpolarized Light be Polarized?

An unpolarized light can be made polarized by the following methods:

1. Passing light through a polarizing filter (e.g, polaroid sheet).
2. Using a polarizing beam splitter.
3. Employing certain optical crystals or materials (e.g., calcite, quartz, etc.).

The most common method by which an unpolarized light can be polarized is by passing it through a polarizing filter, such as a polarizing beam splitter or a polaroid sheet. When an unpolarized light passes through the polarized filter, only that electric field vector which is parallel to the axis of polarized filter can pass through it, while all other vectors are blocked. The resultant light then becomes polarized as shown in Fig. 8.3.
Thus, in simple words, the process of transforming an unpolarized light into a polarized light is said to be polarization.

The orientation of the electric field vector $E$ of light waves in a specific direction is the basis of Polarization.

# 8.2 TYPES OF POLARIZATION

Here are the basic types of polarization of light.

## 1. Linear Polarization

When the electric field vector oscillates in a single plane, light is said to be linearly polarized as shown in Fig.8.4 (a). Example is the light passing through a polarizing filter, like sunglasses.

## 2. Circular Polarization

When the electric field rotates circularly, either clockwise (right-handed), or counterclockwise (left-handed), the light is said to be circularly polarized as shown in Fig.8.4 (b). Example is the light reflected off a CD (Compact Disc) or DVD (Digital Versatile Disc).

## 3. Elliptical Polarization

A combination of linear and circular polarization, where the electric field vector traces an elliptical path is called elliptical polarization. In elliptical polarization as shown in Fig.8.4(c), the two components of electric field $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ are not equal or they differ in phase by an arbitrary angle $\theta$. Example is the light passing through a stress plate or a waveplate.
