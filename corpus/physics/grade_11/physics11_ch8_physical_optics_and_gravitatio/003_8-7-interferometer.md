### 8.7 INTERFEROMETER

An interferometer is an optical tool used in detecting gravitational waves. It is a very sensitive detection device that may use the interference of LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiatoin) beams. The basic LIGO interferometer can be seen in Fig. 8.9.
An interferometer that detects gravitational waves is a highly sensitive instrument that uses LASER light to measure tiny changes in distance between mirrors, caused by gravitational waves passing through the detectors. These interferometers are called

# Physics II

LIGO (LASER Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory). The main differences between LIGO and conventional interferometers are:
(a) LIGO is 1000 times larger than conventional device, and
(b) LIGO uses LASER whereas conventional interferometer has normal light source.

## Basic Components of GW Interferometer

The basic components of a gravitational wave interferometer are:
Fig. 8.9: Basic LIGO interferometer

1. Laser that produces a stable and high intensity beam of light.
2. Power recycling mirror continually reflects LASER light that has already travelled through the instrument back into the interferometer and hence the term recycling is used.
3. Beam splitter divides the LASER beam into two perpendicular beams.
4. Mirrors reflect the beams, creating two perpendicular arms.
5. Fabry Perot cavity consists of two mirrors facing each other. The purpose of the cavity is to enhance the path length.
6. Photodetectors measure the returning beams, detecting tiny phase shifts (if any).
7. Arm cavities enhance the LASER light, increasing sensitivity.

## Working of Interferometer

A laser beam is split into two perpendicular beams, each travelling down two identical paths (arms) of the interferometer. The beams bounce off mirrors at the ends of each arm and return to the starting point, where they are recombined. If a gravitational wave passes through, it causes a tiny disturbance in the distance between the mirrors, resulting in a phase shift between the two beams.
When the beams recombine, they create an interference pattern, which is measured by a photodetector. The tiny phase shift caused by the gravitational wave alters the interference pattern, allowing the detector to sense the wave's presence.
Figure 8.9 is a simple figure of an interferometer, but in reality, it is much more complex. On 14 September 2015, the universe's gravitational waves were observed for the very first time by LIGO. The gravitational waves which were predicted by Albert Einstein

100 years ago, came from a collision between two black holes. It took 1.3 billion years for the waves to arrive at the LIGO detector in the USA. On their work on observation of GWs, Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barisk and Kip S. Throne received Nobel Prize in 2017. It is interesting to note that one of the team members, Nergis Mavalwala a professor at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), belongs to Pakistan.

# Virgo Detection

Similar to LIGO, there is another facility for measuring gravitational waves. This is called Virgo, which works under the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO) Cascina near Pisa, Italy. Virgo is also an interferometer with two arms of 3 km whereas LIGO has 4 km arms. The Virgo Observatory is named after the Virgo constellation, which is visible in the night sky during the months of March, April and May. The Virgo cluster is a group of about 1,500 galaxies about 50 MLYs (Million Light Years) away. Remember one Light Year (LY) is a distance which light travels in one year. The approximate value of $1 \mathrm{LY}=9.5$ billion km . Virgo has been involved in detecting gravitational wave events, with the first detection in 2017.

Example 8.5 If the gravitational waves have a wavelength of 4000 km , find their frequency.

Solution $\lambda=4000 \mathrm{~km}=4 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m}, c=3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, f=$ ?
As $\quad v=f \lambda$
or $\quad f=\frac{c}{\lambda} \quad(\because v=c)$
$\because \quad f=\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}}{4 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m}}$
$f=0.75 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$
$f=75 \mathrm{~Hz}$
Example 8.6 A binary system emits gravitational
waves with a frequency of $10^{-1} \mathrm{~Hz}$. What is the
wavelength of these waves?
Solution $f=10^{-1} \mathrm{~Hz}=10^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, \mathrm{c}=3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, \lambda=$ ?
As $\quad v=f \lambda$
or $\quad \lambda=\frac{c}{f} \quad(\because v=c)$
$\therefore \quad \lambda=\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{10^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}$
$\lambda=3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m}$
