### 8.3 PRODUCTION AND DETECTION OF PLANE POLARIZED LIGHT

The light emitted by an ordinary incandescent bulb is unpolarized, because its electrical vibrations are randomly oriented in space as shown in Fig.8.2.
If unpolarized light is made incident on a sheet of polaroid (polarizer), the transmitted light will be plane polarized. If a second sheet of polaroid (analyzer) is placed in such a way that the axes of the two polaroids shown by stralght lines drawn on them are parallel (Fig. 8.5-a), the light is transmitted through the second polaroid. If the second polaroid (analyzer) is slowly rotated about the beam of light as axis of rotation, the light emerging from the second polaroid gets dimmer and dimmer and ultimately disappears when the axes become mutually perpendicular as shown in Fig. 8.5(b), the light reappears on

further rotation and becomes brightest when the axes are again parallel to each other.
This experiment proves that light waves are transverse waves. If the light waves were longitudinal, they would never disappear even if the two polaroids were mutually perpendicular.
Light reflected from smooth surface of water is partially polarized parallel to the surface.

Experimental arrangement to show that light waves are transverse. The lines with arrows indicate electric vibrations of light waves.

# 8.4 POLARIZATION OF LIGHT BY THE METHOD OF REFLECTION

In 1808, Malus discovered that polarized light is obtained when ordinary light is reflected by a plane sheet of glass. If the reflected light is viewed through a polaroid which is slowly rotated about the line of vision, the light is practically extinguished at a certain
Fig. 8.6: Plane polarization by reflection

orientation of the polaroid. The most suitable angle of incidence ' $i$ ' is about $57^{\circ}$ for glass for which the reflected ray becomes plane polarized, as illustrated by ray diagram in Fig. (8.6). This proves that the light reflected by the glass is practically plane polarized. Light reflected from the surface of a table becomes darker when viewed through a rotated polaroid, showing that it is partially plane polarized.

# Brewster's Law

The particular angle of incidence on a transparent medium when the reflected light is almost plane polarized is called the polarizing angle. Let a beam of unpolarized light be made incident on the surface of medium 2 as shown in Fig.8.6. If the reflected beam of light is almost plane polarized, the reflected and refracted beams are at right angles to each other at the polarizing angle, $i=\theta_{p}$. Thus

$$
\theta_{p}+\theta_{r}=90^{\circ}
$$

or

$$
\theta_{r}=90^{\circ}-\theta_{p}
$$

From Snell's law,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& n_{1} \sin \theta_{p}=n_{2} \sin \theta_{r} \\
& n_{1} \sin \theta_{p}=n_{1} \sin \left(90^{\circ}-\theta_{p}\right) \\
& n_{1} \sin \theta_{p}=n_{2} \cos \theta_{p} \\
& \frac{\sin \theta_{p}}{\cos \theta_{p}}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} \\
& \tan \theta_{p}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Molus's law is used to study the polarization of light in biological systems, such as the polarization of light by cell membranes.

This equation is known as Brewster's law. In this equation, $n_{1}$ is refractive index of medium 1 and $n_{2}$ is refractive index of medium 2. If medium 1 is air, then equation becomes $\tan \theta_{p}=n$ because $n_{1}=1$ and $n_{2}=n$. Here $n$ is refractive index of medium on which light is incident. Hence, Brewester proved that the tangent of the angle of polarization is numerically equal to the refractive index of the medium 2 when medium 1 is air. In Brewster's law, the angle ' $\theta_{p}$ ' for which the reflected ray and the refracted ray make an angle of $90^{\circ}$ between them, is also called the Brewster angle $\theta_{B}$. Then, $\tan \theta_{p}=n$ holds.

Example 8.1 A beam of light strikes the surface of a plate of glass with a refractive index of $\sqrt{3}$ at the polarizing angle. What will be the angle of refraction of the wave of light?

Solution

As

$$
\begin{aligned}
n & =\sqrt{3}, \theta_{r}=? \\
\tan \theta_{B} & =n \\
\theta_{B} & =\tan ^{-1}(\sqrt{3}) \\
\theta_{B} & =60^{\circ} \\
\theta_{r} & =90^{\circ}-\theta_{B}, \quad \theta_{r}=90^{\circ}-60^{\circ} \\
\theta_{r} & =30^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\theta_{p}=90^{\circ}-\theta_{B}
$$

# 8.5 MALUS'S LAW

Malus's law states that the intensity $I$ of plane polarized light after passing through an analyzer is directly proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle $\theta$ between the transmission axis of the analyzer and polarizer. That is;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& I \propto \cos ^{2} 0 \\
& I=I_{0} \cos ^{2} \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

where $I_{0}=$ Intensity of the incident polarized light.
Actually, Malus's law gives a mathematical relation between the intensity of the light incident on the first polaroid (i.e., polarizer) and the intensity of light obtained after passing it
Fig 8.7 (a): Schematic representation of Malus's law
through the second polaroid (i.e., analyzer). This is shown in Fig. 8.7(a). An analyzer is also a polarizer that is placed after a polarizer. Rotation of the analyzer affects the intensity of the polarized light. It is used to further reduce the intensity of light and also adjustit by adjusting the angle of the analyzer with respect to the polarizer.
Certain transparent crystalline materials, like tourmaline, calcite crystals, etc., are capable of confining vibrations of light waves in only one plane. Such materials are called polaroids which have high directionality in crystal structure. Light can also be polarized by natural phenomena like reflection, refraction and scattering.
If a piece of polaroid is rotated in front of a polarized ray of light, it causes a variation in the intensity of the light that gets through. The reason that causes the variation of intensity is the angle between the initial polarizer and the axis of second polarizer.
When the incident polarized light of amplitude $A_{0}$ strikes the analyzer at an angle $\theta$, it is resolved into two components $A_{0} \cos \theta$ and $A_{0} \sin \theta$ as shown in Fig. 8.7(b). The component $A_{0} \sin \theta$ is absorbed in the analyzer. Since, only $A_{0} \cos \theta$ passes through the analyzer, the amplitude $A$ of the transmitted light is therefore,
Fig.8.7(b): Resolution of amplitude into components of plane polarization light.

$$
A=A_{0} \cos \theta
$$

Since intensity $I$ is proportional to the square of the amplitude $A$. it can be expressed as:

# Physics II

$I \propto A^{2}$ or $I=k A^{2}$
where $k=1$, we can write; $I=A^{2}$
or $\quad I=A_{0}^{2} \cos ^{2} \theta$

$$
I=I_{0} \cos ^{2} \theta\left(\because I_{0}=A_{0}^{2}\right)
$$

Here $I_{0}$ is the intensity of the incident polarized light.
There are two extreme conditions of $\theta$ followed by the above equation given as,
i. If $\theta=0^{\circ}$, then $I=I_{0}$. This means the Intensity transmitted through the analyzer is equal to the initial light intensity that passes through the polarizer.
i. If $\theta=90^{\circ}$, then $I=0$. This means the light is extinguished completely, i.e., no light is allowed to pass through the analyzer.

## Optical Activity

Optical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through it. The rotation is detected with a polarizer or analyzer as shown in Fig. 8.6.
Many crystals and solutions rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through them. Such substances are said to be optically active. Examples are quartz crystals, cinnabar $\left(H_{2} S\right)$, sugar water, insulin and collagen. The amount and direction of rotation depends on following factors:
(i) The type of substance
(ii) The concentration of the substance (the amount of a substance present in a given quantity of a mixture or solution).
(iii) The distance the light travels through it, and
(iv) The wavelength of light.

Optical activity occurs due to the asymmetric shape of molecules in the substance, such as being helical. A few millimetre thickness of such crystals will rotate the plane
Sugar solution rotates the plane of polarization of incident light so that it is no longer horizontal but at an angle $\theta$. The analyzer thus stops the light when rotated from the vertical (crossed) positions.

# Physica II

of polarization by many degrees. Certain organic substances, such as sugar and tartaric acid, show optical rotation when they are in a solution. This property of optically active substances can be used to determine their concentration in the solutions.
Example 8.2 Find the refractive index of a medium if polarizing angle is $54.5^{\circ}$.

## Solution

$$
\theta_{n}=54.5^{\circ}, n=?
$$

As

$$
\tan \theta_{n}=n
$$

or

$$
n=\tan \theta_{n}
$$

So

$$
n=\tan 54.5^{\circ}
$$

$$
n=1.4
$$

Example 8.3 Polarized light with an intensity of 75 W $\mathrm{m}^{2}$ passes through an analyzer with its axis at $30^{\circ}$ to the polarizer's axis. What is the emerging intensity?

## Solution

$$
I_{0}=75 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}, \theta=30^{\circ}, I=?
$$

Using Malus's law:

$$
\begin{aligned}
I & =\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{n}} \cos ^{2} \theta \\
I & =75 \mathrm{Nm}^{2} \cos ^{2} 30^{\circ} \\
& =75 \mathrm{Nm}^{2}(6.866)^{2} \\
& =75 \mathrm{Nm}^{2} \times 0.75 \\
I & =56.25 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Looking through two polarizers when they are "crossed", very little light passes through.

Example 8.4 A polarized light with an amplitude of 5 units passes through a polarizer with its electric field aligned at $60^{\circ}$ to the original polarization direction. Find the amplitude of the wave after passing through the analizer?

Solution

$$
A_{0}=5 \text { units, } \theta=60^{\circ}, A=?
$$

Using Malus's law:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A & =A_{n} \cos \theta \\
A & =5 \cos 60^{\circ} \\
& =5 \times 0.5 \\
A & =2.5 \text { units }
\end{aligned}
$$

A beam of unpolarized light passes through a foggy atmosphere. Tell the polarization state of the scattered light.

## Importance of Polarization

The immense significance of polarization of light may be justified by various fields:

# 1. Optics and Photonics

Polarization is essential for applications like polarized sunglasses, LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screens, and optical communication systems.

## 2. Imaging and Microscopy

Polarization enhances image quality, reducing glare (unwanted light that interferes with vision) and improving contrast, especially in microscopy and medical imaging.

## 3. Medical Applications

Polarization is used in cancer diagnosis, tissue imaging, and laser surgery, leveraging its ability to distinguish between different tissue types.

## 4. Astronomy

Polarization helps us to analyze cosmic phenomena, like the polarization of light from distant stars or the cosmic microwave background radiation.

## 5. Miscellaneous Fields

Polarization has importance in miscellaneous fields such as optics and photonics, imaging and microscopy, biology and chemistry, communication system, etc.

## Two Main Applications of Polarization

Polarizers, also known as polarizing filters, have two main applications:

## 1. Sky Photography

A camera which is used to photograph the clouds is fitted with a polaroid. The light coming from the sky is polarized by the polaroid.
In sky photography, polarizers are used to reduce the glare and haze which are produced by the scattering of light by small particles of molecules present in the atmosphere. Polarizers also enhance the contrast by clocking the excessive bright white light while allowing the other colours to pass through, thus creating a brighter detailed image. Thus, allows to improve the overall image quality.

## 2. Stress Analysis of Materials

In materials science, polarizers are used to analyze the stress and strain on materials, such as plastics, metals, and glass.
When a material is stressed, its molecular structure changes, affecting the way, it

interacts with light, and interference patterns on fringes are formed which in turn gives qualitative information about the material. By shining polarized light through the transparent material and analyzing the changes in the light's polarization, the researchers can:

- determine the material's stress patterns
- identify potential weaknesses or defects
- analyze the material's optical properties
- understand how the material will behave under different conditions. This technique is known as "photoelasticity" and is widely used in fields like engineering, materials science, and quality control.
In both cases described above, polarizers play a crucial role in manipulating light to achieve specific goals, whether it is enhancing image quality or analyzing material properties.

# 8.6 GRAVITATIONAL WAVES (GWs)

A gravitational wave is a stretching and compressing of space-time and can be observed by measuring the change in length between two objects.
Gravitational waves (GWs) are actually:
"Ripples in the fabric of space-time, produced by violent cosmic events, like colliding black holes or neutron stars that travel at the speed of light, carrying information about their source."
The simplest example to understand GWs is given below:
Albert Einstein (1878-1955)
A German born Theoretical Physicist
One of the World's renowned scientists.

If we throw a stone into a pond, the stone creates ripples on the water surface (space-time). These ripples travel outward, carrying information about the stone (the cosmic event). They can be detected on the shore by (gravitational wave observatories), revealing the stone's presence and properties.

## Prediction and Detection

Gravitational waves are a prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity which is confirmed by observations and is opening a new window into the universe's most extreme phenomena.
According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, gravity is not a force, but a curvature of space-time caused by massive bodies. Gravity is like a dent in a mattress. Heavy things wrap the space around them, and that is why we feel gravity.
Gravitational waves, as initially predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916, are ripples in spacetime that were first detected in 2015, but announced in 2016, the first

# Physics II

observation of its kind: the detection of gravitational waves, produced from two colliding neutron stars. In this type, there is a gradual increase in frequency and amplitude of GWs.
A Binary System (BS) in the context of gravitational waves refers to "a system consisting of two compact objects, such as black holes, neutron stars, or white dwarfs, which are orbiting each other and emitting gravitational waves."

## Four Basic Types of GWs

There are four basic types of gravitational waves, each with different sources and characteristics:

## 1. Continuous GWs

Dr. Nergis Mavalwala is a Pakistani-American Astrophysics at MIT known for her work on gravitational waves

When a single massive object spins with a constant rate, such as a neutron star, continuous GWs are produced with a constant frequency and amplitude. White dwarf binary systems produce continuous GWs.

## 2. Compact Binary Inspirational GWs

When a binary system, such as binary neutron stars, binary black holes, or a neutron star and black hole orbiting each other, compact inspirational GWs are produced.

## 3. Burst GWs

These are produced by violent events like supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, or cosmic strings.

## 4. Stochastic GWs

BS Model

Stochastic GWs are weak, random signals of GWs which are produced by superposition of many weak gravitational wave sources, such as distant binary systems. These GWs are the most difficult to detect.
Every physical object that accelerates, produces gravitational waves. Vehicles, airplanes, etc. are included in it. The masses and acceleration of objects on the Earth are too small to make gravitational waves big enough to be detected with our instruments.

As the binary systems (also termed as binaries) orbit each other, they emit gravitational waves, which can be detected by observatories like LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory) which is situated in USA and Virgo, a large scale gravitational wave observatory in Cascina, Italy. The waves carry information about the system's mass, spin, and merger dynamics, offering insights into these extreme cosmic objects, and move with the speed of light.
Picture of a series of concentric spheres, with the binary system at the center, radiating gravity waves outward into the cosmos.

The binary systems are significant sources of gravitational waves, and their mergers (collision and union of two massive objects resulting more massive single object) are among the most intense cosmic events.

As the masses orbit and accelerate, their gravitational intensity fluctuates, generating waves that radiate outward in all directions. These waves are not bound by the binary system's gravity; instead, they travel freely through spacetime at the speed of light. The waves propagate through the universe, weakening in intensity as they distance themselves from the source.

The characteristics of GWs depend on the system's properties, such as:
Tidal forces carry the mathematical signature of gravitational waves.

- Masses of the objects
- Orbital period and frequency
- Eccentricity of the orbit: Eccentricity $e$ is a measure of the amount by which an object deviates from a perfect circle.

| $e=0$ | Circular orbit |
| :-- | :-- |
| $e=1$ | Parabolic trajectory |
| $e>1$ | Hyperbolic trajectory |
| $0<e<1$ | Elliptical orbit |

# Space-time Distortion/Tidal Forces

Gravitational waves passing through a body with mass can cause the body to experience periodic stretching and compressing, also known as "space-time distortion". This effect is known as "tidal forces" and is a result of the gravitational wave's oscillating nature. As the gravitational wave passes through
Spacetime curve of an artificial and a natural satellite
the body, it causes the space-time around the body to oscillate, leading to a periodic stretching and compressing of the body in the direction perpendicular to the wave's propagation. This effect is similar to how the tides on Earth are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun.
The amount of stretching and compressing depends on the strength of the gravitational wave, as well as the mass and size of the body. This effect is an important prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity.
Gravitational waves generated by far off celestial events, such as the merger of two black holes or neutron stars, pass through the Earth. However, the amplitude of these waves is extremely small, typically of the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2}$ metres. This means that the
Spacetime curve shown by two satellites
distortion caused by the gravitational wave is incredibly tiny, and requires extremely sensitive instruments to detect.
Despite their small amplitude, gravitational waves offer a unique window into the universe, allowing us to study strong-field gravity, to test general relativity, and to explore the universe in ways previously impossible.
