## Force and Motion

## Learning Objectives

After studying this chapter, the students will be able to:

- Differentiate between scalar and vector quantities
- Represent a vector in 2-D as two perpendicular components
- Describe the product of two vectors (dot and cross-product) along with their properties
- Derive the equations of motion [For uniform acceleration cases only. Derive from the definitions of velocity and acceleration as well as graphically]
- Solve problems using the equations of motion [For the cases of uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including the motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance. This also includes situations where the equations of motion need to be resolved into vertical and horizontal components for 2-D motion]
- Evaluate and analyse projectile motion in the absence of air resistance [This includes solving problems making use of the below facts:
  - (i) Horizontal component (V, J) of velocity is constant
  - (ii) Acceleration is in the vertical direction and is the same as that of a vertically free falling object
  - (iii) The horizontal motion and vertical motion are independent of each other. Situations may require students to determine for projectiles
    - How high does it go?
    - How far would it go along the level (and)?
    - Where would it be after a given time?
    - How long will it remain in flight?
  - Situations may also require students to calculate for a projectile launched from ground height the launch angle that results in the maximum range
    - Relation between the launch angles that result in the same range.
- Predict qualitatively how air resistance affects projectile motion. [This includes analysis of both the horizontal component and vertical component of velocity and hence predicting qualitatively the range of the projectile]
- Apply the principle of conservation of momentum to solve simple problems [including elastic and inelastic interactions between objects in both one and two dimensions. Knowledge of the concept of coefficient of restitution is not required. Examples of applications include:
  - Kerata chops to break a pile of bricks
  - Car crashes
  - Ball & ball
  - The motion under thrust of a rocket in a straight line considering short thrusts during which the mass remains constant]
- Predict and analyse motion for elastic collisions [This includes making use of the fact that for an elastic collision, total kinetic energy is conserved and the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation]
- Justify how the momentum of a closed system is always conserved, some change in kinetic energy may take place.

# BASIC CONCEPT OF SCALARS AND VECTORS

Scalars and vectors are basic concepts in physics. Many problems in physics require to distinguish between scalar and vector quantities to apply the correct mathematical and conceptual approaches. Understanding scalars and vectors help us to grasp how Physics applies to real-world situations, such as calculating the total distance travelled (scalar) or determining the magnitude and direction of force (vector). Learning these concepts develops critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This chapter is primarily concerned with vector algebra and its application in uniform accelerated motion, in a straight line, motion of freely falling bodies in uniform gravitational field, projectile motion, and interaction between objects in one and two dimensions.

### 2.1 SCALARS

Scalars are physical quantities that are described solely by a magnitude (size or amount) without any mention of direction. Thus, scalars are directionless and can be fully characterized by a single number and its associated unit.

## Examples:

Mass: The amount of matter in an object. For example, 2 kg .
Distance: The total length of the path travelled by an object irrespective of the direction. For example, 50 m .
Speed: The rate at which an object covers distance. For example, $40 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$.
Time: The duration between two events taking place. For example, 20 s .
Energy: The capacity to do work. For example, 25 J .
Temperature: A measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. For example, $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

### 2.2 VECTORS

Those physical quantities which require magnitude as well as direction for their complete specification are known as vectors.

## Examples:

Displacement: The change in position of an object. It has length, a distance (magnitude) and a direction (e.g. 10 m towards west).
Velocity: The speed of an object in a particular direction (e.g., $50 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$ towards west).
Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity that occurs in either speed or direction or both (e.g., $10 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ upward).
Force: A push or pull acting on an object, determined by its magnitude and direction (e.g; 20 N to the right)

# Graphical Representation of a Vector

A good way to represent a vector quantity is to use a vector diagram, in which vectors are often represented by arrows. The length of the arrows indicates the magnitude and the head of the arrow shows the direction of the vector. Vectors are typically denoted by bold face letters (e.g; $\mathrm{V}, \mathrm{F}$ ) or an arrow above symbol ( $\overline{\mathrm{A}}$ ).

## Rectangular Components of a Vector

A component of a vector is its effective value in a given direction. A vector may be considered as the resultant of its component vectors along the specified directions. It is usually convenient to resolve a vector into its components along the mutually perpendicular directions. Such components are called rectangular components.
Let there be a vector $A$ represented by a line $O P$ making an angle $\theta$ with the $x$-axis. Draw projection $O M$ of vector $A$ on $x$-axis and projection $O N$ of vector $A$ on $y$-axis as shown in Fig.2.1. Projection OM being along $x$-direction is represented by $A_{x}$ and projection $O N$ along $y$-direction is represented by $A_{y}$. By applying head to tail rule:

$$
A=A_{x}+A_{y}
$$

Thus, $A_{x}$ and $A_{y}$ are the comoponants of vector $A$. Since these are at right angles to each other, they are called rectangular components of $A$. Considering the right angled triangle OMP, the magnitude of $A_{x}$ or $x$-component of $A$ is:

$$
A_{x}=A \cos \theta
$$

And the magnitude of $A_{x}$ or $y$-component of $A$ is:

$$
A_{y}=A \sin \theta
$$

## Determination of a Vector from its Rectangular Components

If the rectangular components of a vector as shown in Fig.(2.1) are given, we can find out the magnitude of the vector by using Pythagorean Theorem.
In the right angle $\triangle O M P$

$$
\begin{aligned}
(O P)^{2} & =(O M)^{2}+(M P)^{2} \\
A^{2} & =A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2} \\
A & =\sqrt{A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The direction $\theta$ is given by

$$
\tan \theta=\frac{M P}{O M}=\frac{A_{y}}{A_{x}}
$$

or

$$
\theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{A_{y}}{A_{x}}\right)
$$

# 2.3 PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS

There are two types of vector multiplications. The product of these two types are known as scalar product and vector product.

If the product of two vectors results in a scalar quantity, it is called scalar product while if the product of two vectors results in a vector quantity, it is called vector product.

## Scalar or Dot Product

The scalar product of two vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is written as $\mathbf{A} . \mathbf{B}$ and is defined as:

$$
A . B=A B \cos \theta
$$

where $A$ and $B$ are the magnitudes of vectors $A$ and $B$ and $\theta$ is the angle between them.
For physical interpretation of dot product of two vectors $A$ and B, these are first brought to a common origin (Fig.2.2-e) then, $A . B=A$ (projection of $B$ on $A$ )
or
Fig. 2.2 (e)

A. $B=A$ (magnitude of component of $B$ in the direction of $A$ ), Fig.2.2(b)

$$
=A(B \cos \theta)=A B \cos \theta
$$

Similarly

$$
B . A=B(A \cos \theta)=B A \cos \theta
$$

This type of product when we consider the work done by a force $F$ whose point of application moves a distance $d$ in a direction making an angle $\theta$ with the line of action of $F$, as shown in Fig. 2.3.
Work done $=$ (Effective component of force in the direction of motion) $\times$ Distance moved

$$
=(F \cos \theta) d=F d \cos \theta
$$

Using vector notation:
F.d $=F d \cos \theta=$ Work done

# Characteristics of Scalar Product

1. Since $A . B=A B \cos \theta$ and $B . A=B A \cos \theta=A B \cos \theta$, hence, $A . B=B . A$. The order of multiplication is irrelevant. In other words, scalar product is commutative.
2. The scalar product of two mutually perpendicular vectors $\left(\theta=90^{\circ}\right)$ is zero.

$$
A . B=A B \cos 90^{\circ}=0
$$

3. The scalar product of two parallel vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes. Thus, for parallel vectors $\left(\theta=0^{\circ}\right)$

$$
A . B=A B \cos 0^{\circ}=A B
$$

For antiparallel vectors $\left(\theta=180^{\circ}\right)$

$$
A . B=A B \cos 180^{\circ}=-A B
$$

4. The self product of a vector $A$ is equal to square of its magnitude.

$$
A . A=A A \cos 0^{\circ}=A^{2}
$$

5. Scalar product of two vectors $A$ and $B$ in terms of their rectangular components

$$
A . B=A_{x} B_{y}+A_{y} B_{z}+A_{z} B_{z}
$$

Equation (2.6) can be used to find the angle between two vectors. Since,

$$
A . B=A B \cos \theta=A_{x} B_{x}+A_{y} B_{y}+A_{z} B_{z}
$$

Therefore

$$
\cos \theta=\frac{A_{x} B_{x}+A_{y} B_{y}+A_{z} B_{z}}{A B}
$$

# Vector or Cross Product

The vector product of two vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, is a vector which is defined as:

$$
A \times B=A B \sin \theta \hat{n}
$$

where $\hat{n}$ is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ as shown in Fig. 2.4 (a). Its direction can be determined by right hand rule. For that purpose, place together the tail of vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to define the plane of vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. The direction of the product vector is perpendicular to this plane. Rotate the First vector $\mathbf{A}$ into $\mathbf{B}$ through the smaller of the two possible angles and curl the fingers of the right hand in the direction of rotation, keeping the thumb erect. The direction of the product vector will be along the erect thumb, as shown in the Fig 2.4 (b). Because of this direction rule, $\mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{A}$ is a vector opposite in sign to $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}$ (Fig. 2.4-c). Hence,
## Characteristics of Cross Product

1. Since $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}$ is not the same as $\mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{A}$, the cross product is non commutative. so,

$$
A \times B \neq B \times A
$$

2. The cross product of two perpendicular vectors $\left(\theta=90^{\circ}\right)$ has maximum magnitude.

$$
A \times B=A B \sin 90^{\circ} \hat{n}=A B \hat{n}
$$

3. The cross product of two parallel or anti-parallel vectors is a null vector, because for such vectors $\theta=0^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$. Hence,

$$
A \times B=A B \sin 0^{\circ} \hat{n}=0 \text { or } A \times B=A B \sin 180^{\circ} \hat{n}=0
$$

As a consequence $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{0}\left(\theta=0^{\circ}\right)$
4. The magnitude of $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}$ is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed with $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$

as two adjacent sides (Fig.2.4-d).

# Examples of Vector Product

i. When a force $F$ is applied on a rigid body at a point whose position vector is $\mathbf{r}$ from any point on the axis about which the body rotates, then the turning effect of the force called the torque $\tau$ is given by the vector product of $r$ and $F$.

$$
\tau=r \times F
$$

ii. The force $F$ on a particle of charge $q$ and velocity $v$ in a magnetic field of strength $B$ is given by vector product of $v$ and $B$.

$$
F=q(v \times B)
$$

### 2.4 EQUATIONS OF MOTIONS

Equations of motion can be used to describe the motion of an object in terms of its three kinematic variables: velocity $v$, position $S$ and time $t$. There are three ways to pair these variables up: velocity-time, position-time and velocity-position. In this order, they are called first equation of motion, second equation of motion and third equation of motion, respectively.
These equations of motion can only be applied to those objects, which are moving in a straight line with constant acceleration.

## Derivation of First Equation of Motion

Suppose a body is moving with uniform acceleration along a straight line with an initial velocity $v_{i}$. Suppose its velocity changes from initial value $v_{i}$ to a final value $v_{f}$ in time interval $t$. Then the acceleration produced in the body during this time interval is given as:

$$
a=\frac{v_{i}-v_{i}}{t}
$$

Rearranging, we can write

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{i}-v_{i} & =a t \\
v_{i} & =v_{i}+a t
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the first equation of motion. It correlates the final velocity attained by a body with initial velocity and the time interval $t$, when moving with constant acceleration $a$.

## Derivation of First Equation of Motion By Graphical Method

First equation of motion can be derived using velocity-time graph for an object moving with initial velocity $v_{i}$ final velocity $v_{f}$ and constant acceleration $a$.
Let the velocity of a body at point $A$ be $v_{i}$ which changes to $v_{i}$ at point $B$ in time interval $t$ as shown in Fig.2.5. A perpendicular BD is drawn from point $B$ to $x$-axis and another perpendicular BE from B on $y$-axis, such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{OA}=\mathrm{v}=\text { Initial velocity of the body } \\
& \mathrm{OE}=\mathrm{DB}=\mathrm{v}=\text { Final velocity of the body }
\end{aligned}
$$

From the graph, it can observed that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{DB}=\mathrm{DC}+\mathrm{CB} \\
& \mathrm{DB}=\mathrm{OA}+\mathrm{CB} \quad(\mathrm{As} \quad \mathrm{OA}=\mathrm{DC})
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore

$$
v_{t}=C B+v_{t}
$$

Fig. 2.5: Velocity-Time Graph
The value of CB in the above equation can be determined by taking the slope of line $A B$, which is equal to acceleration $a$.

$$
a=\frac{C B}{A C}
$$

As

$$
A C=t
$$

So

$$
a=\frac{C B}{t}
$$

or
$B C=a t$
$(2.13)$

Combining Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13), we have

$$
v_{t}=v_{i}+a t
$$

This is the first equation of motion.

# Derivation of Second Equation of Motion

Suppose a body is moving with uniform acceleration a along a straight line with an initial velocity $v_{0}$ which become $v_{0}$ after time interval $t$. Let it covers a distance $S$ in a particular direction during time $t$, then using the definition of velocity as rate of change of displacement, we can write
or

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Velocity } \quad=\text { Displacement } / \text { Time } \\
& \text { Displacement }=\text { Velocity } \times \text { Time }
\end{aligned}
$$

If velocity of the body is not constant, we can use average velocity instead of velocity.
Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Displacement }=\text { Average velocity } \times \text { Time } \\
& \text { Displacement }=\frac{(\text { Initial velocity }+(\text { Final velocity })}{2} \times \text { Time } \\
& S=\frac{\left(v_{i}+v_{i}\right)}{2} \times t
\end{aligned}
$$

Using first equation of motion, $\quad S=\frac{\left(v_{i}+v_{i}+a t\right)}{2} \times t$

$$
S=\frac{\left(2 v_{i}+a t\right)}{2} \times t
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 S=2 v_{1} t+a t^{2} \\
& S=v_{1} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the second equation of motion.

# Derivation of Second Equation of Motion by Graphical Method

Second equation of motion can be derived using velocity-time graph for a body moving with initial velocity $v_{1}$ which attains a final value $v_{f}$ in time interval $t$. While moving with constant acceleration $a$, it covers a displacement $S$ in time $t$.
It can be seen from the graph that distance travelled by the body is, $S=v \times t$.
Also

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S=\text { Area of the figure OABD } \\
& S=(\text { Area of the rectangle } O A C D)+(\text { Area of the triangle } A B C) \\
& S=(\mathrm{OA} \times \mathrm{OD})+\frac{1}{2}(\mathrm{AC} \times \mathrm{BC})
\end{aligned}
$$

As

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{OA} & =v_{1} \text { and } \mathrm{OD}=\mathrm{AC}=t . \mathrm{So} \text {, the above equation becomes: } \\
S & =v_{1} \times t+\frac{1}{2}(i \times B C)
\end{aligned}
$$

Here $B C=a t$ (From graphical representation of first equation of motion). By putting this value in the above equation, we have

$$
S=v_{1} t+\frac{1}{2}(i \times a t)
$$

$$
S=v_{1} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

This is the second equation of motion.

## Derivation of third equation of motion

Consider a body moving along a straight line with an initial velocity $v_{1}$ which attains a final value $v_{f}$ in time $t$. Let the displacement of the body be $S$ during this time interval. Then, we can write:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Displacement } & =\left(\frac{\text { Initial velocity }+ \text { Final velocity }}{2}\right) \times \text { Time } \\
S & =\frac{\left(v_{1}+v_{f}\right)}{2} \times t \\
2 S & =\left(v_{f}+v_{f}\right) \times t
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the first equation of motion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{f}=v_{1}+a t \\
& t=\frac{v_{f}-v_{f}}{a}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the value of $t$ in Eq. (2.15)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 S=\left(v_{1}+v_{1}\right)\left(\frac{v_{1}-v_{1}}{a}\right) \\
& 2 a S-v_{1}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the third equation of motion.

# Derivation of third Equation of Motion by Graphical method

In the speed-time graph shown in the figure, the total distance $S$ travelled by a body is given by the area $O A B D$ under the graph, such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S=\frac{1}{2} \text { (Sum of parallel sides) } \times \text { Height } \\
& S=\frac{1}{2}(O A+B D) \times O D
\end{aligned}
$$

Since

$$
O A=v_{1}, B D=v_{1} \text { and } O D=t
$$

The above equation becomes:

$$
S=\frac{1}{2}\left(v_{1}+v_{1}\right) \times t
$$

From first equation of motion,

$$
t=\frac{v_{1}-v_{1}}{a}
$$

Putting $t$ in above equation

$$
S=\frac{1}{2}\left(v_{1}+v_{1}\right) \frac{\left(v_{1}-v_{1}\right)}{a}
$$

or

$$
S=\frac{1}{2}\left(v_{1}+v_{1}\right) \frac{\left(v_{1}-v_{1}\right)}{a}
$$

$$
2 a S=v_{1}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}
$$

This is the third equation of motion.
The equations of motion are useful in solving the problems relating to linear motion with uniform acceleration, when an object moves along a straight line. If its direction of motion does not change, then all the vector quantities can be manipulated like scalars. In such cases, initial velocity is taken as positive. A negative sign is assigned to quantities where direction is opposite to that of initial velocity. In the absence of air resistance, all objects in free fall at the surface of the Earth, move towards the Earth with a uniform acceleration. This acceleration is known as acceleration due to gravity, denoted by $g$ and its average value at the Earth surface is taken as $9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ in the downward direction. The equation for uniformly accelerated motion can also be applied to free fall motion of the object by replacing a by g .

Example 2.2 A car travelling at $10 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ accelerates uniformally at $2 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$. Calculate its velocity after 5 s .
Solution $v_{1}=10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$
$a=2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$
$t=5 \mathrm{~s}$
$v_{1}=$ ?
Using first equation of motion, we can write

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}=v_{1}+a t \\
& v_{1}=10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}+2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \times 5 \mathrm{~s} \\
& v_{1}=10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}+10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
& v_{1}=20 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 2.3 A car travels with initial velocity of $15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. It accelerates at a rate of $2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$ for 4 seconds. Find the displacement of the car.

# Solution

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}=15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\
& a=2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \\
& t=4 \mathrm{~s}
\end{aligned}
$$

Displacement $S=$ ?
By using 2nd equation of motion

$$
S=v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

Putting the values

$$
S=\left(15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \times 4 \mathrm{~s}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}\right)(4 \mathrm{~s})^{2}
$$

$$
S=76 \mathrm{~m}
$$

Example 2.4 In a short distance race, a contestant in a car starts from rest and reaches the velocity of $300 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$, after covering a distance of 0.45 km at a constant acceleration. Find this constant acceleration.

Solution Initial velocity $=v_{1}=0$
Final velocity $=v_{1}=300 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$

$$
v_{1}=\frac{300 \times 1000}{60 \times 60} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
$$

$$
=83.33 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

Distance covered $=S=0.45 \mathrm{~km}=0.45 \times 1000 \mathrm{~m}=450 \mathrm{~m}$
Using third equation of motion, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{t}^{2}-v_{t}^{2} & =2 a S \\
\left(83.33 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}-(0)^{2} & =2 \times a \times 450 \mathrm{~m} \\
a & =\frac{6943.88 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}{900 \mathrm{~m}} \\
a & =7.72 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 2.5 MOTION UNDER GRAVITY

A body falling freely under the action of gravity is the most familiar example of uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion. According to Gallio, all bodies fall freely (in vacuum) under the acceleration due to gravity, denoted by ' $g$ '. Its experimental value is $9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ in SI units. This means that different bodies, when allowed to fall from the same height, strike the ground with the same velocity. As regards the sign of $g$, it is taken positive for a falling body (when initial velocity is zero) and negative for a body projected vertically upward (when initial velocity is not zero).
The equations of motion for a freely falling body, on putting $a=g$, become

$$
\begin{gathered}
v_{t}=v_{t}+g t \\
S=h=v_{t} t+\frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\
v_{t}^{2}-v_{t}^{2}=2 g h
\end{gathered}
$$

Example 2.5. An iron ball of mass 1 kg is dropped from a tower. The ball reaches the ground in 3.34 s . Find: (a) the velocity of the ball on striking the ground, (b) the height of the tower.

Solution Since the ball is falling under the action of gravity, we shall putt $a=g$ in equations of motion.

Mass of the ball

$$
m=1 \mathrm{~kg}
$$

Time taken to reach ground $t=3.34 \mathrm{~s}$
Initial velocity

$$
v_{t}=0
$$

Final velocity

$$
v_{t}=?
$$

Accelration

$$
a=g=9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

(a) Using first equation of motion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}=v_{1}+g t \\
& v_{1}=0+\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)(3.34 \mathrm{~s}) \\
& v_{1}=32.7 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

(b) Using third equation of motion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{1}^{2}-v_{1}^{2} & =2 g h \\
\left(32.7 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}-(0)^{2} & =2 \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2} \times h \\
h & =\frac{1069.29 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}}{19.6 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}} \\
h & =54.56 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 2.6 PROJECTILE MOTION

Uptill now we have been studying the motion of a particle along a straight line i.e., motion in one dimension. Now we consider the motion of a ball, when it is thrown horizontally from certain height. It is observed that the ball travels forward as well as falls downward, until it strikes something such as ground. Suppose that the ball leaves the hand of the thrower at pointA(Fig 2.8-a) and that its velocity at that instant is completely horizontal. Let this velocity be $v_{1}$. According to Newton's first law of motion, there will be no acceleration in horizontal direction, unless a horizontally directed force acts on the ball. Ignoring the air friction, only force acting on the ball during flight is the force of gravity. There is no horizontal force acting on it. So, its horizontal velocity will remain unchanged and will be $v_{1}$, until the ball hits the ground. The horizontal motion of ball is simple. The ball moves with constant horizontal velocity component. Hence, horizontal distance $x$ is given by

$$
x=v_{x} \times t
$$

Fig. 2.8(a)
Fig. 2.8(b)

It is not necessary that an object should be thrown with some initial velocity in the horizontal direction. A football kicked off by a player; a ball thrown by a cricketer and a missile fired from a launching pad, all projected at some angles with the horizontal, are called projectiles.

Projectile motion is two dimensional motion under constant acceleration due to gravity.

In such cases, the motion of a projectile can be studied easily by resolving it into horizontal and vertical components which are independent of each other. Suppose that a projectile is fired in a direction angle $\theta$ with the horizontal by velocity $v_{1}$ as shown in Fig.2.8(b). Let components of velocity $v_{1}$ along the horizontal and vertical directions be $v_{1} \cos \theta$ and $v_{1} \sin \theta$, respectively. The horizontal acceleration is $a_{v}=0$ because we have neglected air resistance and no other force is acting along this direction, whereas the vertical acceleration is $a_{v}=g$. Hence, the horizontal component $v_{1}$ remains constant and at any time $t$, we have

$$
v_{t v}=v_{11}=v_{1} \cos \theta
$$

Now we consider the vertical motion. The initial vertical component of the velocity is $v_{1} \sin \theta$ in the upward direction.
The vertical component $v_{11}$ at any instant $t$ can be determined by considering the upward motion of projectile as free fall motion $\left(a_{v}=-g\right)$. Using 1st equation of motion:

$$
v_{t v}=v_{1} \sin \theta-g t
$$

The magnitude of velocity at any instant is:

$$
v=\sqrt{v_{t v}^{2}+v_{t y}^{2}}
$$

The angle $\phi$ which this resultant velocity makes with the horizontal can be found from

$$
\tan \phi=\frac{v_{t y}}{v_{t v}}
$$

In projectile motion one may wish to determine the height to which the projectile rises, the time of flight and horizontal range. These are described below.

# Height of the Projectile

In order to determine the maximum height the projectile attains, we use the equation of motion:

$$
2 a S=v_{i}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}
$$

As body moves upward, $a=-g$, the initial vertical velocity $v_{0}=v_{i} \sin \theta=v_{i}$ as $v_{0}=0=v_{i}$, because the body comes to rest after reaching the highest point. Since

$$
\begin{aligned}
S & =\text { height }=h \\
-2 g h & =0-v_{i}^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

or

$$
h=\frac{v_{i}^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta}{2 g}
$$

The height of projectile will be reduced in presence of air resistance. In the presence of air resistance, the upward velocity of the projectile will decrease and hence its height will also decrease during time $t$.

# Time of Flight

The time taken by body to cover the distance from the place of tis projection to the place where it hits the ground is called the time of flight.
This can be obtained by taking $S=h=0$, because body goes up and comes back to the same level, thus covering no vertical distance. If the body is projecting with velocity $v_{i}$ making angle $\theta$ with the horizontal, then its vertical component will be $v_{i} \sin \theta$. Hence, the equation of motion is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S=v_{i} t+\frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\
& 0=v_{i} \sin \theta t \frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\
& t=\frac{2 v_{i} \sin \theta}{g}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $f$ is the time of flight of the projectile when it is projected from the ground.

## Range of the projectile

Maximum distance which a projectile covers in the horizontal direction is called the range of the projectile.
To determine the range $R$ of the projectile, we multiply the horizontal component of the velocity of projection with total time taken by the body to hit the ground after leaving the point of projection. Thus,

$$
R=v_{N} \times t
$$

or

$$
R=\frac{v_{i} \cos \theta \times 2 v_{i} \sin \theta}{g}
$$

or

$$
R=\frac{v_{i}^{2}}{g} 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta
$$

For an angle less than $45^{\circ}$, the height reached by the projectile and the range both will be less. When the angle of projectile is larger than $45^{\circ}$, the height attained will be more but the range is again less.

# Physica II

As $2 \sin \theta \cos \theta=\sin 2 \theta$, thus, the range of the projectile depends upon the velocity of projection and the angle of projection.

Therefore

$$
R=\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{g} \sin 2 \theta
$$

For maximum range $R$, the factor $\sin 2 \theta=1$, so

$$
2 \theta=\sin ^{-1}(1) \text { or } 2 \theta=90^{\circ} \quad \text { or } \quad \theta=45^{\circ}
$$

Air resistance will slow down projectile forward motion, reducing its velocity $v_{1}$. The reduction in $v_{1}$ will result in a decrease in the range of projectile.
Furthermore, air resistance is not constant throughout the flight of the object. As the object slows down, the air resistance experienced by it also decreases. This means that the object retards more slowly and accelerates more slowly as it falls down. This results in a trajectory that is not perfectly parabolic but is skewed, with steeper descent than ascent.

Example 2.6 A ball is thrown with a speed of $30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ in a direction $30^{\circ}$ above the horizon. Determine the height to which it rises, the time of flight and the horizontal range.

Solution Initially

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}=v_{1} \cos \theta=30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \times \cos 30^{\circ}=25.98 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\
& v_{1}=v_{1} \sin \theta=30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \times \sin 30^{\circ}=15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

As the time of flight, is

$$
\begin{aligned}
t & =\frac{2 v_{1}}{g} \sin \theta \\
& =\frac{2 \times 30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-}}{9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}} \times(0.5) \\
\text { So } & =\frac{2 \times 15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-}}{9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}}=3.1 \mathrm{~s} \\
\text { Height } & h=\frac{v_{1}^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta}{2 g} \\
\text { So } & h=\frac{\left(30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}(0.5)^{2}}{19.6 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}} \\
& h=11.5 \mathrm{~m} \\
\text { Range } & R=\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{g} \sin 2 \theta=\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{g} \sin 60^{\circ} \\
\text { So } & R=\frac{\left(30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2} \times 0.866}{9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}} \\
& =79.53 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

For your information
In the presence of air friction the trajectory of a high speed projectile falls short of a parabolic path.

# 2.7 MOMENTUM

We are aware of the fact that moving object possesses a quality by virtue of which it exerts a force on anything that tries to stop it. The faster the object is travelling, the harder it is to stop it. Similarly, if two objects move with the same velocity, then it is more difficult to stop the massive of the two. Newton referred to this property as "momentum", a vector quantity defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity. This term is now called linear momentum $p$ of the body and is defined by the relation:

$$
p=m \vee \ldots \ldots \ldots(2.25)
$$

In this expression, $v$ is the velocity of the mass $m$. Linear momentum is, therefore, a vector quantity and has the direction of velocity. The SI unit of momentum is kilogram metre per second ( $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ). It can also be expressed as newton second (Ns).

## Momentum and Newton's Second Law of Motion

Consider a body of mass $m$ moving with an initial velocity $v_{i}$. Suppose an external force $F$ acts upon it for time $t$ after which velocity becomes $v_{i}$. The acceleration a produced by this force is given by

$$
a=\frac{v_{r}-v_{i}}{t}
$$

By Newton's second law, the acceleration is given as:

$$
a=\frac{F}{m}
$$

Equating the two expressions of acceleration, we have

$$
\frac{F}{m}=\frac{v_{r}-v_{i}}{t}
$$

or

$$
F \times t=m v_{i}-m v_{i}
$$

where $m v_{1}$ is the initial momentum and $m v_{r}$ is the final momentum of the body.
Which hurt you in the above situations (a) or (b) and think why?

The equation (2.26) shows that change in momentum is equal to the product of force and the time for which force is applied. This form of the second law is more general than the form $F=m a$, because it can easily be extended to account for changes as the body accelerates when its mass also changes. For example, as a rocket accelerates, it loses mass because its fuel is burnt and ejected to provide greater thrust. From Eq. (2.28)

$$
F=\frac{m v_{r}-m v_{i}}{t}
$$

Thus, second law of motion can also be stated in terms of momentum as:

Can a moving object experience impulse?

## Your hair acts like a crumple zone on your skull. A force of 5 N might be enough to fracture your naked skull (uranium), but with a covering of skin and hair, a force of 50 N would be needed.

Time rate of change of momentum of a body is equal to the applied force.

# Impulse

Sometimes we wish to apply the concept of momentum to cases where the applied force is not constant, it acts for very short time. For example, when a bat hits a cricket ball, the force certainly varies from instant to instant during the collision. In such cases, it is more convenient to deal with the product of force and time ( $F \times t$ ) instead of either quantity alone. The product of average force $F$ that acts during time tis called impulse given by

$$
\text { Impulse }=\mathrm{F} \times t=m \mathrm{v}_{1}-m \mathrm{v}_{1} \quad \ldots \ldots \ldots(2.27)
$$

Example 2.7 A 1500 kg car has its velocity reduced from $20 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime}$ to $15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime \prime}$ in 3.0 s . How large was the average retarding force?

Solution Using the Eq. (2.27)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F \times t=m v_{1}-m v_{1} \\
& F \times 3.0 \mathrm{~s}=1500 \mathrm{~kg} \times 15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime}-1500 \mathrm{~kg} \times 20 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime} \\
& \text { or } \quad \begin{aligned}
F \quad & =-2500 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
& =-2500 \mathrm{~N}=-2.5 \mathrm{kN}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

The negative sign indicates that the force is retarding one.

## Law of Conservation of Momentum

Let us consider an isolated system. It is a system on which no external agency exerts any force. For example, the molecules of a gas enclosed in a glass vessel at constant temperature constitute an isolated system. The molecules can collide with one another because of their random motion, but being enclosed by glass vessel, no external agency can exert a force on them.
Consider an isolated system of two smooth hard interacting balls of masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, moving along the same straight line, in the same direction, with velocities $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ respectively. Both the balls collide and after collision, ball of mass $m_{1}$ moves with velocity $v_{1}$ vand $m_{2}$ moves with velocity $v_{2}^{\prime}$ in the same direction as shown in Fig. (2.9).
To find the change in momentum of mass $m_{1}$.
Using Eq. (2.27) as:
Fig. 2.9

$$
F \times t=m_{1} v_{1}-m_{1} v_{1}
$$

Similarly, for the ball of mass $m_{2}$, we have

$$
F^{\prime} \times t=m_{2} v_{2}^{\prime}-m_{2} v_{2}
$$

Adding these two expressions, we have

$$
\left(F+F^{\prime}\right) t=\left(m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime}-m_{1} v_{1}\right)+\left(m_{2} v_{2}^{\prime}-m_{2} v_{2}\right)
$$

Since the action force $F$ is equal and opposite to the reaction force $F^{\prime}$, we have $F^{\prime}=-F$, or $F+F^{\prime}=0$ so the left hand side of the equation is zero. Hence,

$$
0=\left(m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime}-m_{1} v_{1}\right)+\left(m_{2} v_{2}^{\prime}-m_{2} v_{2}\right)
$$

In other words, change in momentum of 1st ball + change in momentum of the $2^{\text {nd }}$ ball is zero.
or $\left(m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}\right)=\left(m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime}+m_{2} v_{2}^{\prime}\right)$
When a moving car stops quickly, the passengers move forward towards the windshield. Beatbelts change the forces of motion and prevent the passengers from moving. Thus, the chance of injury is greatly reduced.

Which means that total initial momentum of the system before collision is equal to the total final momentum of the system after collision. Consequently, the total change in momentum of the isolated two ball system is zero.
For such a group of objects, if one object within the group experiences a force, there must exist an equal but opposite reaction force on other object in the same group. As a result, the change in momentum of the group of objects as a whole is always zero. This can be expressed in the form of law of conservation of momentum, which states that:

The total linear momentum of an isolated system remains constant.
In applying the conservation law, we must notice that the momentum of a body is a vector quantity.

Example 2.8 Two spherical balls of 2.0 kg and 3.0 kg masses are moving towards each other with velocities of $6.0 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and $4 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, respectively. What must be the velocity of the smaller ball after collision, if the velocity of the bigger ball is $3.0 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ?

Solution As both the balls are moving towards one another, so their velocities are of opposite sign. Let us suppose that the direction of motion of 2 kg ball is positive and that of the 3 kg is negative.
The momentum of the system before collision is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2} & =2 \mathrm{~kg} \times 8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}+3 \mathrm{~kg} \times\left(-4 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right) \\
& =12 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}-12 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}=0
\end{aligned}
$$

A motorcycle's safety helmet is padded so as to extend the time of any collision to prevent serious injury.

Momentum of the system after collision $=m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}^{\prime}$

$$
=2 \mathrm{~kg} \times v_{1}^{\prime}+3 \mathrm{~kg} \times(-3) \mathrm{m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime}
$$

From the law of conservation of momentum

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Momentum of the system } \\
& \text { before collision }
\end{aligned} \quad=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\text { Momentum of the system } \\
\text { after collision }
\end{array}\right] \\
& 0=2 \mathrm{~kg} \times v^{\prime}-9 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime \prime} \\
& v_{1}^{\prime}=4.5 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime \prime}
$$

# 2.8 ELASTIC AND INELASTIC COLLISIONS

When a tennis ball is dropped on the floor vertically, it may not rebound to its initial height. It is because, a portion of $K . E$. is lost, partly due to friction as the molecules in the ball move past one another when the ball distorts and partly due to its change into heat and sound energies. Similar is the case when two tennis balls collide with certain velocities, their final kinetic energy may be less than the total initial kinetic energy.

A collision in which the K.E. of the system is not conserved, is called inelastic collision.

Under certain special conditions, no kinetic energy is lost in the collision or impact on hitting the floor. Such type of collision is said to be elastic collision.

For example, when a hard ball is dropped onto a marble floor, it rebounds to very nearly the initial height. It loses negligible amount of energy in the collision with the floor. It is to be noted that momentum and total energy are conserved in all types of collisions. However, the K.E. is conserved only if it is an elastic collision.

## Elastic Collisions in One Dimension

Consider two smooth, non-rotating balls of masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ moving initially with velocities $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ respectively, in the same direction. They collide and after collision, they move along the same straight line without rotation. Let their velocities after the collision be $\mathbf{v}^{\prime}$, and $\mathbf{v}_{2}^{\prime}$ respectively, as
Before collision shown in Fig.(2.10).
We take the positive direction of the velocity and momentum to the right. By applying the law of conservation of momentum we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}\right)=\left(m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}\right) \\
& m_{1}\left(v_{1}-v_{1}^{\prime}\right)=m_{2}\left(v_{2}^{\prime}-v_{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Fig. 2.10

As the collision is elastic, so the K.E. is conserved. From the conservation of K.E.,

# Physica II

we have

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2} & =\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2} \\
m_{1}\left(v_{1}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\right) & =m_{2}\left(v_{2}^{2}-v_{2}^{2}\right) \\
m_{1}\left(v_{1}+v_{1}^{\prime}\right)\left(v_{1}-v_{1}^{\prime}\right)=m_{2}\left(v_{2}^{\prime}+v_{2}\right)\left(v_{2}^{\prime}-v_{2}\right) & \ldots \ldots . .(2.30)
\end{array}
$$

Dividing Eq. (2.29) by (2.30)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(v_{1}+v_{1}^{\prime}\right) & =\left(v_{2}^{\prime}+v_{2}\right) \\
\left(v_{1}-v_{2}\right) & =\left(v_{2}^{\prime}-v_{1}^{\prime}\right)=-\left(v_{1}^{\prime}-v_{2}^{\prime}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

We note that, before collision $\left(v_{1}-v_{2}\right)$ is the velocity of first ball relative to the second ball. Similarly $\left(v_{1}^{\prime}-v_{2}^{\prime}\right)$ is the velocity of the first ball relative to the second ball after collision. It means that relative velocities before and after the collision has the same magnitude but are reversed after the collision. In other words, the magnitude of relative velocity of approach is equal to the magnitude of relative velocity of separation.
In equations (2.29) and (2.30) $m_{1}, m_{2}, v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are known quantities. We solve these equations to find the values of $v_{1}^{\prime}$ and $v_{2}^{\prime}$ which are unknown. The results are

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}^{\prime}=\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1}^{\prime}+\frac{2 m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{2} \\
& v_{2}^{\prime}=\frac{2 m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1}^{\prime}+\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Before collision
There are some cases of special interest, which are discussed below:
(i) When $m_{1}=m_{2}$

From Eq. (2.32) and (2.33), we find that
and

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}^{\prime}=v_{2} \\
& v_{2}^{\prime}=v_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

(as shown in Fig. 2.11)
(ii) When $m_{1}=m_{2}$ and $v_{2}=0$

In this case, the mass $m_{1}$ be at rest, and $v_{2}=0$, then Eqs. (2.32) and (2.33) give

$$
v_{1}^{\prime}=0 ; \quad v_{2}^{\prime}=v_{1}
$$

When $m_{1}=m_{2}$ then ball of mass $m_{1}$ after collision will come to a stop and $m_{2}$ will take off with the velocity that $m_{1}$ originally had, as shown in Fig.(2.12). Thus when a billiard ball $m_{1}$, moving on
Fig. 2.11
case (II)
Before collision
After collision

Fig. 2.12

a table collides with exactly similar ball $m_{2}$ at rest, the ball $m_{1}$ stops while $m_{2}$ begins to move with the same velocity, with which $m_{1}$ was moving initially.
(iii) When a light body collides with a massive body at rest
In this case initial velocity $v_{2}=0$ and $m_{2} \gg>m_{1}$. Under these conditions $m_{1}$ can be neglected as compared to $m_{2}$. From Eq. (2.33) and (2.32), we have $v_{1}^{\prime}=-v_{1}$ and $v_{2}^{\prime}=0$.
The result is shown in Fig.(2.13). This means that $m_{1}$ will bounce back with the same velocity while $m_{2}$ will remain stationary. This fact is used of by the squash player.
(iv) When a massive body collides with light stationary body

In this case, $m_{1} \gg>m_{2}$ and $v_{2}=0$, so $m_{2}$ can be neglected in Eqs.(2.32) and (2.33). This gives $v_{1}^{\prime} \approx v_{1}$ and $v_{2}^{\prime} \approx 2 v_{1}$. Thus, after the collision, there is practically no change in the velocity of massive body, but the lighter one bounces off in the forward direction with approximately twice the velocity of the incident body, as shown in Fig.(2.14).

# 2.9 INELASTIC COLLISION IN ONE DIMENSION

Consider two bodies having masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, moving with velocities $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, along the same line such that $v_{1}>v_{2}$. In such a case $m_{1}$ is regarded as projectile and $m_{2}$ as target. After time $t$ both the bodies make inelastic collision and stick together. Let their combined mass become $m_{1} \pm m_{2}$ which moves with final velocity $v_{1}$ after collision.
Since the collision is perfectly inelastic, the total momentum of balls is conserved. Using law of conservation of momentum.
Total momentum of system before collision = Total momentum of the system after collision

$$
\begin{gathered}
m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) v_{1} \\
v_{1}=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1}+\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{2}
\end{gathered}
$$

Which gives the common velocity of the body after inelastic collision.

In a special case when the target $m_{2}$ is at rest, $v_{2}=0$, the above equation becomes:

$$
v_{1}=\begin{gathered}
m_{1} \\
m_{1}+m_{2}
\end{gathered}
$$

It shows that velocity of $m_{1}$ is reduced by the mass ratio i.e., $\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}$.

Example 2.9 A 70 g ball collides with another ball of mass 140 g . The initial velocity of the first ball is $9 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ to the right while the second ball is at rest. If the collision were perfectly elastic. What would be the velocity of the two balls after the collision?

Solution

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
m_{1}=70 \mathrm{~g} & v_{1}=9 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
m_{2}=140 \mathrm{~g} & v_{1}^{\prime}=? \\
v_{2}^{\prime}=?
\end{array}
$$

We know that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{1}^{\prime} & =\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1} \\
& =\left(\frac{70 \mathrm{~g}-140 \mathrm{~g}}{70 \mathrm{~g}+140 \mathrm{~g}}\right) \times 9 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}=-3 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\
v_{2}^{\prime} & =\frac{2 m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1} \\
& =\left(\frac{2 \times 70 \mathrm{~g}}{70 \mathrm{~g}+140 \mathrm{~g}}\right) \times 9 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
& =6 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 2.10 ELASTIC COLLISION IN TWO DIMENSIONS

Consider the motion of two balls of mass $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ in a straight line with velocities $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ respectively undergoing an elastic collision with each other as shown in Fig. 2.18
Assume the bodies move off in different directions after collision with velocities $v^{\prime}$, and $v^{\prime}$, making angles 0 . and $0_{2}$ respectively with $x$-axis.
Fig. 2.16

As, the collision is elastic, so we apply both the laws of conservation of momentum and law of conservation of kinetic energy. Momentum is a vector quantity, we resolve it into its rectangular components and apply the law of conservation of momentum along both axes.

# Momentum conservation along $x$-axis is:

Momentum before collision $=$ momentum after collision

$$
m_{1} v_{1}+m_{1} v_{2}=m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime} \cos \theta_{1}+m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime} \cos \theta_{2}
$$

Momentum conservation along $y$-axis:
Momentum before collision $=$ Momentum after collision

$$
0=m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime} \sin \theta_{1}-m_{1} v_{2}^{\prime} \sin \theta_{2}
$$

## Conservation of Energy

Kinetic Energy before collision = Kinetic Energy after collision

$$
\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2}
$$

These equations ( 2.35 to 2.37 ) are useful in solving problems about elastic collisions in two dimensions.

### 2.11 INELASTIC COLLISION IN TWO DIMENSIONS

The macroscopic collisions are generally inelastic and do not conserve Kinetic energy.
The perfect inelastic collision is one in which the colliding objects stick together to make a single mass after collision. Its analysis can be carried out as follows:
Let us take two balls having masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ moving with velocities, $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, respectively, in a two-dimensional $x y$ plane. Assume that the first body is moving along the $x$-axis while the second body moves in a direction, making an angle $\theta$ with $x$-axis. Both the bodies collide at the origin as shown in the figure 2.17 .
Fig. 2.17

After collision, bodies stick together, having combined mass $M=m_{1}+m_{2}$, which moves with velocity $v_{1}$, making an angle $\phi$ with $x$-axis.

## Momentum in the $x$-direction:

$$
m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2} \cos \theta=M v_{1} \cos \phi
$$

Momentum in the $y$-direction:

$$
0+m_{2} v_{2} \sin \theta=M v_{1} \sin \phi
$$

Equation 2.38 and 2.39 can be used to find the final velocity.

## Kinetic Energy

Since collision is inelastic, the kinetic energy of colliding system is not conserved. The loss of kinetic energy is computed as follows:

# Initial Kinetic Energy

The total initial kinetic energy $K . E_{i}$ of the system before the collision is:

$$
(K . E)_{i}=\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{i}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2}
$$

Since $K . E$. is a scalar quantity, so velocities involving in the formula of $K . E$. does not require to break velocities into their components.

## Final Kinetic Energy

The total final kinetic energy $K . E_{t}$ after the collision (when the objects stick together) is:

$$
(K . E)_{r}=\frac{1}{2} M v_{i}^{2}
$$

where $v_{i}$ is magnitude of the final velocity which can be calculated from Eq. (2.41).

## Energy Loss in the Collision

Since the collision is inelastic, there is a loss in kinetic energy, represented by $\Delta K . E$.

$$
\Delta K . E_{i}=(K . E)_{t}-(K . E)_{r}
$$

This lost kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat, sound, or in deformation.

## Some examples of an inelastic collision:

(i) When a karate chop breaks a pile of bricks, it's an example of an inelastic collision. In this type of collision, the objects involved don't bounce back after impact. Instead, some of the energy from the strike is absorbed by the bricks, converting into heat, sound, and the force needed to break them. This means the energy goes into breaking the bricks rather than causing the hand to rebound. If the Karate chop is not perfectly vertical and involves some horizontal motion, the momentum transfer and the resulting forces will have both horizontal and vertical components.
(ii) In a car crash, the collision is an inelastic nature. When the vehicles collide and absorb the impact energy, causing them to crumple and deform. This energy absorption slows down the cars, stopping them from bouncing back. Most of the kinetic energy is lost, turning into heat, sound, and damage to the vehicles.
(iii) In real-world collisions, a ball and bat show an inelastic behaviour. When the bat hits the ball, some of the kinetic energy is lost because the ball deforms, and energy is also converted into heat and sound. Even though the bat is rigid, it does not transfer energy perfectly and absorbs some energy itself. The ball compresses upon impact, which leads to further energy loss. Consequently, not all of the initial kinetic energy is conserved, making the collision overall an inelastic.

# 2.12 ROCKET PROPULSION

Rockets move by expelling burning gas through engines at their rear. The ignited fuel turns to a high pressure gas which is expelled with extremely high velocity from the rocket engines (Fig. 2.18). The rocket gains momentum equal to the momentum of the gas expelled from the engine but in opposite direction. The rocket engines continue to expel gases after the rocket has begun moving and hence rocket continues to gain more and more momentum. So, instead of travelling at steady speed the rocket gets faster and faster so long the engines are operating.
A rocket carries its own fuel in the form of a liquid or solid hydrogen and oxygen. It can, therefore work at great heights where very little or no air is present. In order to provide enough upward thrust to overcome gravity, a typical rocket consumes about $10000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime \prime}$ of fuel and ejects the burnt gases at speeds of over $4000 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime \prime}$. In fact, more than $80 \%$ of the launch mass of a rocket consists of fuel only. One way to overcome the problem of mass of fuel is to make the rocket from several rockets linked together.
When one rocket has done its job, it is discarded leaving others to carry the space cratt further up at ever greater speed.
If $m$ is the mass of the gases ejected per second with velocity $v$ relative to the rocket, the change in momentum per second of the ejecting gases is mv. This equals the thrust produced by the engine on the body of the rocket. So, the acceleration 'a' of the rocket is

$$
a=\frac{m v}{M} \ldots \ldots(2.42)
$$

where $M$ is the mass of the rocket. When the fuel in the rocket is burned and ejected, the mass $M$ of rocket decreases and hence the acceleration increases.
Fuel and oxygen mix in the combustion chamber. Hot gases exhaust the chamber at a very high velocity. The gain in momentum of the gases equals the gain in momentum of the rocket. The gas and rocket push against each other and move in opposite directions.
