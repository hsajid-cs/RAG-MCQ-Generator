### 2.11 INELASTIC COLLISION IN TWO DIMENSIONS

The macroscopic collisions are generally inelastic and do not conserve Kinetic energy.
The perfect inelastic collision is one in which the colliding objects stick together to make a single mass after collision. Its analysis can be carried out as follows:
Let us take two balls having masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ moving with velocities, $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, respectively, in a two-dimensional $x y$ plane. Assume that the first body is moving along the $x$-axis while the second body moves in a direction, making an angle $\theta$ with $x$-axis. Both the bodies collide at the origin as shown in the figure 2.17 .
Fig. 2.17

After collision, bodies stick together, having combined mass $M=m_{1}+m_{2}$, which moves with velocity $v_{1}$, making an angle $\phi$ with $x$-axis.

## Momentum in the $x$-direction:

$$
m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2} \cos \theta=M v_{1} \cos \phi
$$

Momentum in the $y$-direction:

$$
0+m_{2} v_{2} \sin \theta=M v_{1} \sin \phi
$$

Equation 2.38 and 2.39 can be used to find the final velocity.

## Kinetic Energy

Since collision is inelastic, the kinetic energy of colliding system is not conserved. The loss of kinetic energy is computed as follows:

# Initial Kinetic Energy

The total initial kinetic energy $K . E_{i}$ of the system before the collision is:

$$
(K . E)_{i}=\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{i}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2}
$$

Since $K . E$. is a scalar quantity, so velocities involving in the formula of $K . E$. does not require to break velocities into their components.

## Final Kinetic Energy

The total final kinetic energy $K . E_{t}$ after the collision (when the objects stick together) is:

$$
(K . E)_{r}=\frac{1}{2} M v_{i}^{2}
$$

where $v_{i}$ is magnitude of the final velocity which can be calculated from Eq. (2.41).

## Energy Loss in the Collision

Since the collision is inelastic, there is a loss in kinetic energy, represented by $\Delta K . E$.

$$
\Delta K . E_{i}=(K . E)_{t}-(K . E)_{r}
$$

This lost kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat, sound, or in deformation.

## Some examples of an inelastic collision:

(i) When a karate chop breaks a pile of bricks, it's an example of an inelastic collision. In this type of collision, the objects involved don't bounce back after impact. Instead, some of the energy from the strike is absorbed by the bricks, converting into heat, sound, and the force needed to break them. This means the energy goes into breaking the bricks rather than causing the hand to rebound. If the Karate chop is not perfectly vertical and involves some horizontal motion, the momentum transfer and the resulting forces will have both horizontal and vertical components.
(ii) In a car crash, the collision is an inelastic nature. When the vehicles collide and absorb the impact energy, causing them to crumple and deform. This energy absorption slows down the cars, stopping them from bouncing back. Most of the kinetic energy is lost, turning into heat, sound, and damage to the vehicles.
(iii) In real-world collisions, a ball and bat show an inelastic behaviour. When the bat hits the ball, some of the kinetic energy is lost because the ball deforms, and energy is also converted into heat and sound. Even though the bat is rigid, it does not transfer energy perfectly and absorbs some energy itself. The ball compresses upon impact, which leads to further energy loss. Consequently, not all of the initial kinetic energy is conserved, making the collision overall an inelastic.

# 2.12 ROCKET PROPULSION

Rockets move by expelling burning gas through engines at their rear. The ignited fuel turns to a high pressure gas which is expelled with extremely high velocity from the rocket engines (Fig. 2.18). The rocket gains momentum equal to the momentum of the gas expelled from the engine but in opposite direction. The rocket engines continue to expel gases after the rocket has begun moving and hence rocket continues to gain more and more momentum. So, instead of travelling at steady speed the rocket gets faster and faster so long the engines are operating.
A rocket carries its own fuel in the form of a liquid or solid hydrogen and oxygen. It can, therefore work at great heights where very little or no air is present. In order to provide enough upward thrust to overcome gravity, a typical rocket consumes about $10000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime \prime}$ of fuel and ejects the burnt gases at speeds of over $4000 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime \prime}$. In fact, more than $80 \%$ of the launch mass of a rocket consists of fuel only. One way to overcome the problem of mass of fuel is to make the rocket from several rockets linked together.
When one rocket has done its job, it is discarded leaving others to carry the space cratt further up at ever greater speed.
If $m$ is the mass of the gases ejected per second with velocity $v$ relative to the rocket, the change in momentum per second of the ejecting gases is mv. This equals the thrust produced by the engine on the body of the rocket. So, the acceleration 'a' of the rocket is

$$
a=\frac{m v}{M} \ldots \ldots(2.42)
$$

where $M$ is the mass of the rocket. When the fuel in the rocket is burned and ejected, the mass $M$ of rocket decreases and hence the acceleration increases.
Fuel and oxygen mix in the combustion chamber. Hot gases exhaust the chamber at a very high velocity. The gain in momentum of the gases equals the gain in momentum of the rocket. The gas and rocket push against each other and move in opposite directions.
