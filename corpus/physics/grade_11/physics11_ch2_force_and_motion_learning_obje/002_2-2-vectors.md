### 2.2 VECTORS

Those physical quantities which require magnitude as well as direction for their complete specification are known as vectors.

## Examples:

Displacement: The change in position of an object. It has length, a distance (magnitude) and a direction (e.g. 10 m towards west).
Velocity: The speed of an object in a particular direction (e.g., $50 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$ towards west).
Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity that occurs in either speed or direction or both (e.g., $10 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ upward).
Force: A push or pull acting on an object, determined by its magnitude and direction (e.g; 20 N to the right)

# Graphical Representation of a Vector

A good way to represent a vector quantity is to use a vector diagram, in which vectors are often represented by arrows. The length of the arrows indicates the magnitude and the head of the arrow shows the direction of the vector. Vectors are typically denoted by bold face letters (e.g; $\mathrm{V}, \mathrm{F}$ ) or an arrow above symbol ( $\overline{\mathrm{A}}$ ).

## Rectangular Components of a Vector

A component of a vector is its effective value in a given direction. A vector may be considered as the resultant of its component vectors along the specified directions. It is usually convenient to resolve a vector into its components along the mutually perpendicular directions. Such components are called rectangular components.
Let there be a vector $A$ represented by a line $O P$ making an angle $\theta$ with the $x$-axis. Draw projection $O M$ of vector $A$ on $x$-axis and projection $O N$ of vector $A$ on $y$-axis as shown in Fig.2.1. Projection OM being along $x$-direction is represented by $A_{x}$ and projection $O N$ along $y$-direction is represented by $A_{y}$. By applying head to tail rule:

$$
A=A_{x}+A_{y}
$$

Thus, $A_{x}$ and $A_{y}$ are the comoponants of vector $A$. Since these are at right angles to each other, they are called rectangular components of $A$. Considering the right angled triangle OMP, the magnitude of $A_{x}$ or $x$-component of $A$ is:

$$
A_{x}=A \cos \theta
$$

And the magnitude of $A_{x}$ or $y$-component of $A$ is:

$$
A_{y}=A \sin \theta
$$

## Determination of a Vector from its Rectangular Components

If the rectangular components of a vector as shown in Fig.(2.1) are given, we can find out the magnitude of the vector by using Pythagorean Theorem.
In the right angle $\triangle O M P$

$$
\begin{aligned}
(O P)^{2} & =(O M)^{2}+(M P)^{2} \\
A^{2} & =A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2} \\
A & =\sqrt{A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The direction $\theta$ is given by

$$
\tan \theta=\frac{M P}{O M}=\frac{A_{y}}{A_{x}}
$$

or

$$
\theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{A_{y}}{A_{x}}\right)
$$

# 2.3 PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS

There are two types of vector multiplications. The product of these two types are known as scalar product and vector product.

If the product of two vectors results in a scalar quantity, it is called scalar product while if the product of two vectors results in a vector quantity, it is called vector product.

## Scalar or Dot Product

The scalar product of two vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is written as $\mathbf{A} . \mathbf{B}$ and is defined as:

$$
A . B=A B \cos \theta
$$

where $A$ and $B$ are the magnitudes of vectors $A$ and $B$ and $\theta$ is the angle between them.
For physical interpretation of dot product of two vectors $A$ and B, these are first brought to a common origin (Fig.2.2-e) then, $A . B=A$ (projection of $B$ on $A$ )
or
Fig. 2.2 (e)

A. $B=A$ (magnitude of component of $B$ in the direction of $A$ ), Fig.2.2(b)

$$
=A(B \cos \theta)=A B \cos \theta
$$

Similarly

$$
B . A=B(A \cos \theta)=B A \cos \theta
$$

This type of product when we consider the work done by a force $F$ whose point of application moves a distance $d$ in a direction making an angle $\theta$ with the line of action of $F$, as shown in Fig. 2.3.
Work done $=$ (Effective component of force in the direction of motion) $\times$ Distance moved

$$
=(F \cos \theta) d=F d \cos \theta
$$

Using vector notation:
F.d $=F d \cos \theta=$ Work done

# Characteristics of Scalar Product

1. Since $A . B=A B \cos \theta$ and $B . A=B A \cos \theta=A B \cos \theta$, hence, $A . B=B . A$. The order of multiplication is irrelevant. In other words, scalar product is commutative.
2. The scalar product of two mutually perpendicular vectors $\left(\theta=90^{\circ}\right)$ is zero.

$$
A . B=A B \cos 90^{\circ}=0
$$

3. The scalar product of two parallel vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes. Thus, for parallel vectors $\left(\theta=0^{\circ}\right)$

$$
A . B=A B \cos 0^{\circ}=A B
$$

For antiparallel vectors $\left(\theta=180^{\circ}\right)$

$$
A . B=A B \cos 180^{\circ}=-A B
$$

4. The self product of a vector $A$ is equal to square of its magnitude.

$$
A . A=A A \cos 0^{\circ}=A^{2}
$$

5. Scalar product of two vectors $A$ and $B$ in terms of their rectangular components

$$
A . B=A_{x} B_{y}+A_{y} B_{z}+A_{z} B_{z}
$$

Equation (2.6) can be used to find the angle between two vectors. Since,

$$
A . B=A B \cos \theta=A_{x} B_{x}+A_{y} B_{y}+A_{z} B_{z}
$$

Therefore

$$
\cos \theta=\frac{A_{x} B_{x}+A_{y} B_{y}+A_{z} B_{z}}{A B}
$$

# Vector or Cross Product

The vector product of two vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, is a vector which is defined as:

$$
A \times B=A B \sin \theta \hat{n}
$$

where $\hat{n}$ is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ as shown in Fig. 2.4 (a). Its direction can be determined by right hand rule. For that purpose, place together the tail of vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to define the plane of vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. The direction of the product vector is perpendicular to this plane. Rotate the First vector $\mathbf{A}$ into $\mathbf{B}$ through the smaller of the two possible angles and curl the fingers of the right hand in the direction of rotation, keeping the thumb erect. The direction of the product vector will be along the erect thumb, as shown in the Fig 2.4 (b). Because of this direction rule, $\mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{A}$ is a vector opposite in sign to $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}$ (Fig. 2.4-c). Hence,
## Characteristics of Cross Product

1. Since $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}$ is not the same as $\mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{A}$, the cross product is non commutative. so,

$$
A \times B \neq B \times A
$$

2. The cross product of two perpendicular vectors $\left(\theta=90^{\circ}\right)$ has maximum magnitude.

$$
A \times B=A B \sin 90^{\circ} \hat{n}=A B \hat{n}
$$

3. The cross product of two parallel or anti-parallel vectors is a null vector, because for such vectors $\theta=0^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$. Hence,

$$
A \times B=A B \sin 0^{\circ} \hat{n}=0 \text { or } A \times B=A B \sin 180^{\circ} \hat{n}=0
$$

As a consequence $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{0}\left(\theta=0^{\circ}\right)$
4. The magnitude of $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}$ is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed with $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$

as two adjacent sides (Fig.2.4-d).

# Examples of Vector Product

i. When a force $F$ is applied on a rigid body at a point whose position vector is $\mathbf{r}$ from any point on the axis about which the body rotates, then the turning effect of the force called the torque $\tau$ is given by the vector product of $r$ and $F$.

$$
\tau=r \times F
$$

ii. The force $F$ on a particle of charge $q$ and velocity $v$ in a magnetic field of strength $B$ is given by vector product of $v$ and $B$.

$$
F=q(v \times B)
$$
