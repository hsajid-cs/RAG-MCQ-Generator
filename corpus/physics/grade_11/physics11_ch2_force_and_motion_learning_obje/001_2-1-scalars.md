### 2.1 SCALARS

Scalars are physical quantities that are described solely by a magnitude (size or amount) without any mention of direction. Thus, scalars are directionless and can be fully characterized by a single number and its associated unit.

## Examples:

Mass: The amount of matter in an object. For example, 2 kg .
Distance: The total length of the path travelled by an object irrespective of the direction. For example, 50 m .
Speed: The rate at which an object covers distance. For example, $40 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$.
Time: The duration between two events taking place. For example, 20 s .
Energy: The capacity to do work. For example, 25 J .
Temperature: A measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. For example, $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
