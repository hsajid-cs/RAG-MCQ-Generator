### 11.3 SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY

The theory of relativity deals with how observers in different states of relative motion describe physical phenomena. The special theory of relativity addresses problems involving inertial (non-accelerating) frames of reference. There is another theory, called the general theory of relativity, that deals with problems involving frames of reference that are accelerating relative to one another. The special theory of relativity is based on two postulates, which can be stated as follows:
The speed of light $c$ emitted by the flashlight is measured same by two observers, one moving in the car with speed $v$ and other standing on the road.

1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames (Principle of Relativity).
2. The speed of light in free space has the same value for all observers, regardless of the state of motion of the source or the observer (Principle of Constancy of Light).
The first postulate generalizes the fact that all physical laws are the same in frames of reference moving with uniform velocity relative to one another. If the laws of Physics differed for observers in relative motion, those observers could determine which was stationary and which was moving. However, such a distinction does not exist, implying that there is no way to detect absolute uniform motion.
The second postulate states the experimental fact that the speed of light in free space is a universal constant, denoted as $c\left(c=3 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)$. Since $c$ is constant, space and time

become relative. For example, if you are sitting in a train moving at the speed of light and you hold up a mirror in front of you at arm's length, you will still see your reflection in the mirror. This is because, according to the principle of relativity, no experiment can detect the constant motion of the train relative to the person inside it.
These simple postulates have far-reaching consequences. They include phenomena such as the slowing down of clocks and the contraction of lengths in moving reference frames as observed by a stationary observer. Some interesting results of the special theory of relativity can be summarized as follows, without going into their mathematical details.

# The Relativity of Simultaneity

If two events in different locations are observed by one observer to be simultaneous, they will generally not be observed as simultaneous by another observer in a different frame of reference moving relative to the first observer. In other words, whether two events are seen as simultaneous depends on the observer's frame of reference.
Consider a train equipped with light-operated doors. The light switch is located in the centre of the roof and is operated by a traveler standing in the middle of the compartment. When the train is travelling at half the speed of light, the traveler turns on the light. The light travels forward and backward at equal speed and reaches both doors at the same time. Consequently, the traveler sees both doors opening simultaneously. However, an observer outside the train will see the back door open before the front door. This is because the back door is moving towards the light waves, while the front door is moving away from the light waves.

## Time Dilation

If you are in a frame of reference moving at constant velocity from which you cannot see any other frame of reference, there is no way to know if you are moving or at rest.

According to the special theory of relativity, time is not an absolute quantity; it depends on the motion of the frame of reference.
Suppose an observer is stationary in an inertial frame and measures the time interval between two events in this frame. Let this time interval be $t_{0}$. This is known as proper time. If the observer is moving with respect to the frame of events with relativistic velocity $v$, or if the frame of events is moving with respect to the observer with a uniform relativistic velocity $v$, the time measured by the observer will not be $t_{0}$, but rather $t$, given by

$$
t=\frac{t_{0}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}
$$

As the quantity $\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}$ is always less than one, so $t$ is greater than $t_{0}$ i.e., time has dilated or stretched due to the relative motion of the observer and the frame of reference of the events. This astonishing result applies to all timing processes-physical,

chemical, and biological. Even the aging process of the human body is slowed by motion at very high speeds or relativistic speeds.
For example, if a traveler on a plane moving at 0.8 c picks up and opens a book, the event takes one second as measured by the traveler. However, to a person standing outside the plane, the same event takes 1.7 seconds.

# Length Contraction

The distance from Earth to a stermesstured by an observer in a moving spaceship would appear smaller than the distance measured by an observer on the Earth. In other words, if you are in motion relative to two points that are a fixed distance apart, the distance between the two points appears shorter than if you were at rest relative to them. This effect is known as length contraction. Length contraction occurs only along the direction of motion; no such contraction is observed perpendicular to the direction of motion. The length of an object or the distance between two points measured by an observer who is at rest relative to them is called the proper length $\ell_{0}$. If an object and an observer are in relative motion with speed $v$, then the contracted length $l$ is given by

$$
l-l_{0} \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}
$$

Let a train that is measured to be 100 metres long when at rest travel at $80 \%$ of the speed of light ( 0.8 c ). A person inside the train will measure its length as 100 metres. However, a person standing by the side of the track will observe the train to be only 60 metres long. This effect of relativity, which is the shortening of length in the direction of motion, is due to length contraction.

## Mass Variation

According to the special theory of relativity, the mass of an object is a variable quantity that depends on the object's speed. An object whose mass is measured at rest is called its rest mass $m_{s}$, will have an increased mass $m$ when observed to be moving at speed $v$. They are related by

$$
m=\frac{m_{s}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
$$

The increase in mass indicates the increase in inertia that an object has at high speeds. As $v$ approaches $c$, it requires a greater force to change the object's speed.

As

$$
v \rightarrow c, \frac{v}{c} \rightarrow 1, \quad \text { therefore, } \quad \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \rightarrow 0
$$

Thus

$$
m \rightarrow \infty
$$

An infinite mass would require an infinite force to accelerate it. Since infinite forces are not available, an object cannot be accelerated to the speed of light oin free space.
In our everyday life, we deal with speeds that are extremely small compared to the

speed of light. Even Earth's orbital speed is only $30 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, while the speed of light in free space is $300,000 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This is why Newton's laws are valid in everyday situations. However, when dealing with aubatomic particles moving at velocities approaching the speed of light, relativistic effects become very prominent, and experimental results cannot be explained without considering Einstein's equations.

# 11.4 THE EQUILANCE BETWEEN MASS AND ENERGY

According to the special theory of relativity, mass and energy are distinct entities but are interconvertible. The total energy $E$ and mass $m$ of an object are related by the expression:

$$
E=m c^{2}
$$

where $m$ depends on the speed of the object. At rest, the energy equivalent of an object's mass $m_{0}$ is called its rest mass energy $E_{0}$. Thus,

$$
E_{0}=m_{0} c^{2}
$$

As $m c^{2}$ is greater than $m_{0} c^{2}$, the difference of energy $\left(m c^{2}-m_{0} c^{2}\right)$ is due to the motion, and it represents the kinetic energy of the mass. Hence,

$$
K_{1} E_{1}=\left(m-m_{0}\right) c^{2}
$$

From Eq. 11.4, the change in mass $m$ due to change in energy $\Delta E$ is given by

$$
\Delta m=\frac{\Delta E}{c^{2}}
$$

Because $c^{2}$ is a very large quantity, this implies that small changes in mass require very large changes in energy. In our everyday world, energy changes are too small to provide measurable mass changes. However, energy and mass changes in nuclear reactions are found to be exactly in accordance with the aforementioned equations.
