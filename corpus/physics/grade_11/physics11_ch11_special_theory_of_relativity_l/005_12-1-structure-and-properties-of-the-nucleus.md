### 12.1 STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE NUCLEUS

The atomic nucleus comprises two types of particles: protons and neutrons. A proton is the nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen, called a protium. The proton has a positive charge of the same magnitude as that of the electron ( $1.6 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{C}$ ) and its mass is $1.67 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg}$. The neutron, whose existence was pointed out in 1932 by James Chadwick, is electrically neutral as its name suggested and its mass is nearly the same as that of proton. Now we can say that the nucleus has two types of particles (neutrons and protons) called nucleons.

Besides hydrogen, the nuclei of all other elements consist of both neutrons and protons. The different nuclei are called nuclides. The number of protons in a nucleus is called the atomic number represented by the symbol $Z$. The total number of nucleons, the sum of neutrons and protons, is represented by the symbol $A$ and is called the atomic mass number, or simply mass number. It is written as

$$
A=N \cdot \equiv Z
$$

where $N$ represents the neutron number.
In order to specify the given nuclei, the symbol $X$ is commonly used as ${ }_{X}^{A} X$, where $X$ is the chemical symbol for the element. To indicate the mass of atomic particles, instead of kilogram, unified mass scale (u) is generally used. By definition 1 u is exactly one twelveth the mass of carbon-12 atom ( $1 \mathrm{u}=1.6608 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg}=931 \mathrm{MeV}$ ). Using this value of $u$, the mass of a proton is 1.007276 u and that of a neutron is 1.008665 u while that of an electron is 0.00055 u .
For a particular atom (e.g., carbon), nuclei are found to contain different numbers of neutrons, although they all have the same number of protons. For example, carbon nuclei always have 6 protons, but they may have different number of neutrons. Nuclei that contain the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Isotopes of carbon are ${ }_{8}^{12} \mathrm{C},{ }_{6}^{13} \mathrm{C}$, and ${ }_{8}^{14} \mathrm{C}$, amongst them ${ }_{8}^{16} \mathrm{C}$ and ${ }_{8}^{16} \mathrm{C}$ are stable but ${ }_{8}^{14} \mathrm{C}$ is unstable and decays into nitrogen along with the emission of $\beta$ and neutrino

# 12.2 FUNDAMENTAL FORCES OF NATURE

To understand the structure of the nucleus, it is important to know the nature of the forces that bind the nucleon together. But before that, we should know the basic forces in nature. Despite the apparent complexity within the universe, all interactions in the universe are governed by the four basic forces, known as fundamental forces. These forces control how objects move, interact and behave at different scales from nucleons in the atom to massive galaxies. The four fundamental forces are gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force.
Gravitational force or gravity is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is the weakest of the four but it is a long-range force. It is an attractive force and arises due to the gravitational interaction between the bodies. The gravitational force between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. When considered for massive objects, such as the Sun, or giant planets, gravitational force is considered to be significant as the masses of these objects are large. However, on an atomic level, this force is considered to be negligibly weak.
The electromagnetic force is responsible for electric field and magnetic field interactions. Like the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force follows an inverse square law but is much stronger than gravity. It governs a vast range of phenomena, from atomic structure, chemical bonding, electricity, magnetism, and light propagation. James Clerk Maxwell (1861) formulated a set of four fundamental equations named as "Maxwell's equations" that unified electricity and magnetism into electromagnetism. These equations describe how electric and magnetic fields interact and how electromagnetic waves propagate. These equations showed that electric and magnetic fields are not separate forces but are two aspects of a single electromagnetic force.
Out of the four fundamental forces, nuclear forces are the strongest attractive forces. Electromagnetism holds the matter together, but there was no explanation on how the nucleus is held together in the atom. If we only consider the forces of electromagnetism and gravity, the nucleus should fly off in different directions. The stability of the nucleus implies that another force should exist within the nucleus which is stronger than the gravitational force and electromagnetic force. This is where nuclear forces come into play. Strong nuclear forces are responsible for holding the nuclei of atoms together. They only exist inside the nucleus. So, we call them as shortrange forces. The strong nuclear force acts as an attractive force between all nucleons. Thus, protons attract each other via the strong nuclear forces at

Table 12.1
Relative strength and range of four fundamental forces

| Force | Approximate Relative Strength (compared to strong force) | Range |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Gravity | $10^{-20}$ | $\infty$ |
| Weak nuclear forces | $10^{-13}$ | $<10^{-18} \mathrm{~m}$ |
| Electromagnetic | $10^{-2}$ | $\infty$ |
| Strong nuclear forces | 1 | $<10^{-15} \mathrm{~m}$ |

the same time they repel each other via the electric force. A neutron, being electrically neutral, can attract other neutrons or protons via the strong nuclear force. Weak nuclear forces are responsible for the radioactive decay, particularly the beta decay and interactions involving neutrino. Unlike the other fundamental forces, the weak force can change the identity of particles, making it essential for processes like nuclear fusion in stars and the decay of unstable atomic nuclei. The relative strength and range of the above four forces are given in Table 12.1.

# 12.3 MATTER AND ANTI-MATTER

It was predicted by Paul Dirac in 1928 that the fundamental particles have their anti-particles. The rest masses of the anti-particles are the same as that of their corresponding particles but with opposite charges and magnetic moments. For example, positron is the antiparticle of an electron. It is represented by $e^{+}$. The rest mass of the positron is the same as that of an electron but it carries positive charge with magnitude the same as that of an electron. It is noted that the positron was the first discovered anti-particle by Anderson in 1932 in a cloud chamber experiment. This was first experimental discovery of an anti-particle. After that a lot of antiparticles were discovered. Usually, the anti-particles are represented by a letter with a bar over it, e.g., anti-proton is represented by $p$ anti-neutrino by $v$ and so on.
The quarks and leptons have been recognized as the fundamental particles also known as elementary particles among the too many discovered particles These elementary particles have also anti-particles.

For your information
1. A particle accelerator is a huge machine that accelerates charged particles, such as electrons, protons, or ions, to extremely high energies and speeds, approaching the speed of light.
2. Linear Accelerators, Cyclotrons and Betatrons are important particle accelerators.

## 12.3.1 For their work on this discovery, Dirac and Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics-Dirac in 1933, and Anderson in 1936. In 1955, Segre and Chamberlain discovered anti-proton using a particle accelerator and were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1959 for their discovery of anti-proton.

## (i) The cosmic rays are high-energy particles coming from the outer-space with unknown sources. Their source may be the Sun or the other stars. These particles consist mostly of protons, neutrons and heavier nuclei, which are continually bombarding the Earth. When these particles interact with the atoms of the gases of the Earth's atmosphere, they produce showers of secondary particles which rain down on us all the time.
(ii) When nuclei of unstable radioactive element say ${ }^{101} \mathrm{U}$ undergo fission reactions in the nuclear reactors, they emit a variety of particles, such as; neutrons, neutrinos, $\alpha$-particles, photons, electrons and positrons.
(iii) When the charged particles, such as electrons and protons are accelerated by an accelerator and then bombarded on the target material, which is hydrogen, these accelerated charged particles may also collide head-on with each other. As a result, the debris from these reactions contain particles like pions, kaons, muons and even anti-protons.

# Pair Production

Pair production occurs when a $\gamma$-ray (high energy photon) passes nearby an atomic nucleus. As a result, an electron-positron pair is emitted as shown in Fig. 12.1. The presence of a third particle, such as a nucleus, is necessary to conserve linear momentum. According to the law of mass-energy equivalence, the minimum energy of a photon for pair production must be equal to the sum of the rest mass energies of the created particles. The rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair is $2 m_{e} c^{2}=1.02 \mathrm{MeV}$ which has been verified experimentally. A gamma ray photon with energy less than 1.02 MeV cannot produce an electron-positron pair whereas a photon with energy greater than 1.02 MeV creates an electron-positron pair and the excess energy goes into the kinetic energies of the particles.
The process of pair production satisfies the laws of conservation of charge, momentum and energy. It can occur for any particle and anti-
particle.

## Annihilation of Matter

It is the opposite process of pair production. For example, when an electron and a positron interact to each other, they annihilate into two gamma ray photons as shown in Fig. 12.2. The reaction can be written as

$$
e^{+} e^{-} \rightarrow \gamma+\gamma
$$

The energy of each gamma ray photon is 0.51 MeV which is equal to the rest mass energy of an electron or a positron, i.e. $E=m_{e} c^{2}$. In an annihilation reaction, energy and momentum are conserved. Besides the electron and positron annihilation, the annihilation reactions of other particles and their anti-particles can also be carried out e.g., proton and anti-proton, lepton and anti-lepton, quark and anti-quark, etc.

A particle accelerator, named as Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN have revealed that some mass of colliding particles is changed to electromagnetic radiation according to Einstein's equation and left over mass appears in the form of new sub-atomic particles (Fig. 12.3).

# 12.4 RADIOACTIVITY

It has been observed that the nuclei whose atomic numbers are greater than 82 are found naturally unstable, and these nuclei spontaneously emit radiations. Such nuclei are called radioactive and the emission of radiation is known as natural radioactivity. These radiations are of three types, $\alpha, \beta$ and $\gamma$-radiations. Unstable isotopes can also be produced artificially in the laboratory by nuclear reactions. This occurs when a stable element is bombarded with high-energy particles, such as neutrons, protons, alpha particles, or gamma rays, causing it to become unstable and emit radiation. This is called artificial radioactivity and radioactive isotopes are named radioisotopes or radionuclides.
The $\alpha$-particles, $\beta$-particles and $\gamma$-radiations are traversed differently when passed through the electric field as shown in Fig. 12.4. It is seen that $\alpha$-particles deflect towards the negative terminal of the electric field, showing that they have a positive charge. The $\alpha$-particles are emitted at high speeds, typically a few percent of the speed of light. However, $\alpha$-particles can travel only several centimetres in the air due to their large mass. The $\beta$-particles deflect towards the positive terminal of the electric field, showing
Fig. 12.4: The three radioactive radiations, namely alpha, beta and gamma rays

they have a negative charge. The deflection of $\beta$-particles is more than the $\alpha$-particles, proving that they are lighter particles than $\alpha$-particles. The $\beta$-particles are fast-moving electrons and move with speeds up to 0.9995 of the speed of light. The $\gamma$-radiations passed through the electric field without deflection, showing that they have no charge. The $\gamma$-radiations are electromagnetic radiations which consist of photons. They move with the speed of light with the highest penetrating power but the lowest ionization power.
The process of emitting $\alpha$-particles, $\beta$-particles and $\gamma$-radiations from the nucleus is called $\alpha$-decay, $\beta$-decay and $\gamma$-decay, respectively, and are discussed below.

# $\alpha$-Decay

If the nucleus has more protons than the number of neutrons, the electrostatic force of repulsion becomes greater than the strong nuclear force of attraction. In this case, the nucleus becomes unstable and emits alpha particles in radioactive decay. An $\alpha$-particle is equivalent to a helium ( He ) nucleus which consists of two protons and two neutrons. This means the nucleus loses two protons and neutrons in the $\alpha$-decay. Hence, the atomic number $Z$ decreases by 2 while its mass number $A$ decreases by 4. Alpha decay can be written in general as:

$$
{ }_{2}^{4} \mathrm{X} \rightarrow{ }_{2-3}^{4} \mathrm{X}+{ }_{3}^{4} \mathrm{He} \ldots \ldots \text { (12.2) }
$$

Here ${ }_{3}^{4} \mathrm{X}$ is the parent nucleus which decays into the daughter nucleus ${ }_{3-9}^{4} \mathrm{X}$ and ${ }_{2}^{4} \mathrm{He}$ is the alpha particle. In the $\alpha$-decay, it is experimentally observed that the number of nucleons (A) and electric charge are conserved. An example of $\alpha$-decay is given below:
A radium-228 isotope ( ${ }_{56}^{228} \mathrm{Ra}$ ) emits an alpha particle and decays into a daughter nucleus radon-222 ( ${ }_{46}^{222} \mathrm{Rn}$ ).

$$
{ }_{56}^{228} \mathrm{Ra} \rightarrow{ }_{46}^{222} \mathrm{Rn}+{ }_{3}^{4} \mathrm{He} \text {. (12.3) }
$$

In the above nuclear reaction, the daughter nucleus ( ${ }_{56}^{222} \mathrm{Rn}$ ) is different from the parent nucleus ( ${ }_{56}^{220} \mathrm{Ra}$ ). This transition of one element into another is called the transmutation of the elements. It is experimentally found that the mass of the parent nucleus is greater than the total mass of the daughter nucleus and the mass of the $\alpha$-particle. Thus, the total mass-energy ( $E=m c^{2}$ ) of the decay products is less than the mass-energy of the original nuclide. This difference in mass-energy is called the disintegration energy $Q$, or the Q-value of the decay.

## $\beta$-Decay

There are two types of $\beta$-decay; $\beta$-decay and $\beta$-decay.

## (i) $\beta$-Decay

Some nuclides have neutron-to-proton ratio (N/P) too large and are the source of $\beta$-decay. The $\beta$-particles are not the orbital electrons but they are created within the nucleus at the moment of emission. In this process, a neutron in the nucleus decays into

a proton and an electron, plus another particle called anti-neutrino which is the antiparticle of neutrino. The neutrino is denoted by a Greek symbol $v$ (nu) and anti-neutrino is denoted by a bar over the $\bar{v}$. The decay process is given by the following relation:

$$
{ }_{n}^{+} n \rightarrow{ }_{1}^{1} p+{ }_{n}^{+} e+\bar{v}
$$

One of the neutrons changes to a proton and in order to conserve charge it emits an electron. These electrons are called beta particles. However, they are indistinguishable from orbital electrons. Both the neutrino and the anti-neutrino have zero charge and very small mass, that is why they are very difficult to observe when passing through the matter. No nucleons are lost when a $\beta$-particle is emitted, and the total number of nucleons A remains the same but the mass number $Z$ changes. Beta decay process can be written as:

$$
{ }_{Z}^{A} X \rightarrow{ }_{2+}+{ }_{n}^{+} e+\bar{v}
$$

From the above equation, it is clear that the parent element of atomic number $Z$ is transmuted to another element of atomic number ( $Z+1$ ). An example is the isotope of thorium, which is unstable and decays into protactinium by beta emission. The reaction is represented as:

$$
{ }_{2}^{A} \mathrm{Th} \rightarrow{ }_{91}^{238} \mathrm{~Pa}+{ }_{1}^{+} e+\bar{v}
$$

## For reachormation

The neutrino was first proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to obey the energy conservation in the betamirua and beta-plus decays. Later in 1953, neutrino was detected by F. Reines and C. L. Cowan in a high-power nuclear reactor. On this discovery, F. Reines received the Nobel prize in 1995.

# (ii) $\beta^{-}$-Decay

There are also nuclides that have neutron-to-proton ratio (N/P) too small for stability and decay by emitting a positron instead of an electron. The positron (e+) has the same mass as the electron but it has a positive charge. The positron is the anti-particle of the electron. In this process, a proton in the nucleus decays into a neutron and a positron, plus a neutrino. The generalized decay is given below:

$$
{ }_{Z}^{0} X \rightarrow{ }_{Z+}^{A} X+{ }_{4}^{0} e+v
$$

An example of a decay of Neon into Flourine by emitting positron and neutrino is:

$$
{ }_{10}^{12} \mathrm{Ne} \rightarrow{ }_{0}^{12} \mathrm{~F}+{ }_{4}^{0} e+v
$$

## Energy of Alpha and Beta Particles in Radioactive Decay

In both $\alpha$-decay and $\beta$-decay, for a particular radionuclide, the same amount of energy is released. In $\alpha$-decay of a particular radionuclide, every emitted $\alpha$-particle has the same sharply defined kinetic energy. When the number of $\alpha$-particles is plotted against kinetic energy, there are distinct spikes that appear on the graph as shown in Fig. 12.5. This demonstrates that $\alpha$-particles have discrete energies.
Fig. 12.5: Discrete energy values of $\alpha$-particles

However, in the case of $\beta$-particle emission, energy is shared between $\beta$-particle and antineutrino in varying proportions. The sum of electron (or positron) energy and the antineutrino's (or neutrino's) energy, however, in every case remains the same. Thus, in $\beta$-decay, the energy of an electron or a positron may range from zero to a maximum value. When the number of $\beta$-particles is plotted against kinetic energy, the graph shows a curve as shown in Fig. 12.6. This demonstrates that beta particles
Kinetic energy (eV)
Fig. 12.6: Continuous spectrum of $\beta$-particles
(electrons or positrons) have a continuous range of energies. The principle of conservation of momentum and energy applies in both alpha and beta emission.

# (III) $\gamma$-Radiation

The emission of $\gamma$-radiation from a nucleus is generally represented by this equation:

$$
\Sigma \rightarrow \Sigma X+\gamma
$$

where $\Sigma \vec{X}$ represents an excited nucleus while $\Sigma \vec{X}$ shows ground state of the nucleus.
