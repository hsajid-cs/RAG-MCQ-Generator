### 11.2 FRAMES OF REFERENCE

We have discussed the most commonly used Cartesian Coordinate System. In effect, a frame of reference is any coordinate system relative to which measurements are taken. For example, the position of a table in a room can be described relative to the walls of the room, making the room the frame of reference. Similarly, the laboratory is the reference frame for measurements taken there. If the same experiment is performed in a moving train, the train becomes the frame of reference. The position of a spaceship can be

described relative to the positions of distant stars. A coordinate system based on these stars is then the frame of reference.

# Inertial and Non-inertial Frame of Reference

An inertial frame of reference is defined as a coordinate system in which the law of inertia is valid. This means a body at rest remains at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force that produces acceleration. Other laws of nature also apply in such a system. For instance, a body placed on the Earth remains at rest unless an unbalanced force acts upon it, indicating that the Earth can be considered an inertial frame of reference. A body in a car moving with uniform velocity relative to the Earth also remains at rest, so the car is also an inertial frame of reference. Thus, any frame of reference moving with uniform velocity relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame.
However, if the moving car is suddenly stopped or accelerated, the body inside no longer remains at rest. In such cases, the car is not an inertial frame of reference. Therefore, an accelerated frame of reference is a non-inertial frame. While Earth is rotating and revolving, making it strictly speaking a non-inertial frame, it is often treated as an inertial
frame due to its relatively small acceleration.
