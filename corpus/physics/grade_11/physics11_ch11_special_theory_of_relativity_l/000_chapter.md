(It can be thought of as a metaphorical sheet of paper that can bend, and when it bends it can cause effects such as stretching and compression seen when gravitational waves pass through objects.)

At the beginning of the 20th century, new experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that classical physics, based on Newton's laws, could not explain phenomena involving extremely small particles or very high velocities. This led to the development of relativistic mechanics, which offered a more comprehensive framework than classical mechanics and fundamentally changed our view of the universe. Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, introduced in 1905, addressed these issues by proposing that the laws of Physics are the same for all observers and that the speed of light is constant, regardless of the observer's motion. This theory not only resolved the conflicts between classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory but also revolutionized our understanding of time, space, and motion, forming the basis of what is now known as modern physics. This chapter will explore how Einstein's theory reshaped our view of the universe and continues to influence our understanding of the physical world.

### 11.1 RELATIVE MOTION

Consider throwing a ball to your right. For someone facing you, this direction appears to his left. This illustrates that direction is a relative concept. Similarly, the state of rest or motion of an object depends on the observer. For example, the walls of a moving train

# Physics II

seem stationary to passengers inside the train but appear to be moving to someone standing on the ground. Thus, we cannot definitively say whether an object is absolutely at rest or in motion; all motions are relative to the observer or to the reference frame being used. This becomes evident with the following example: An observer in a closed train compartment uses the compartment as his frame of reference. To determine the train's motion, the observer crops a ball and measures the horizontal distance travelled by the ball, keeping the vertical distance the same in each case. It is assumed that the vertical distance is covered in " $t$ " seconds in all scenarios.
Case (a): Suppose the train is stationary. In that case, the horizontal velocity of the ball will be zero, and the horizontal distance travelled will also be zero. In this scenario, the observations made by the observer inside the train and by someone outside the train will be identical. The ball will have fallen to a point on the floor directly below the point from where it was dropped (Fig. 11.1-a).
Case (b): The train is moving with a uniform velocity $v_{v}$. When the ball is released, it has an initial horizontal velocity $v_{v}$ and behaves like a projectile. It travels a horizontal distance $v_{v} t$ in time $t$ it takes for the ball to reach the floor. Since both the train and the observer inside it are moving with the same velocity $v_{v}$, they both travel the same horizontal distance $v_{v} t$ in the same time $t$. Therefore, the observer inside the train sees that the ball falls to a point on the floor directly below where it was dropped. In contrast, an observer outside the train will see the ball following a projectile path, as shown in Fig. 11.1(b). Thus, observers in different frames of reference, moving with uniform velocity relative to each other, will perceive motion differently.
### 11.2 FRAMES OF REFERENCE

We have discussed the most commonly used Cartesian Coordinate System. In effect, a frame of reference is any coordinate system relative to which measurements are taken. For example, the position of a table in a room can be described relative to the walls of the room, making the room the frame of reference. Similarly, the laboratory is the reference frame for measurements taken there. If the same experiment is performed in a moving train, the train becomes the frame of reference. The position of a spaceship can be

described relative to the positions of distant stars. A coordinate system based on these stars is then the frame of reference.

# Inertial and Non-inertial Frame of Reference

An inertial frame of reference is defined as a coordinate system in which the law of inertia is valid. This means a body at rest remains at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force that produces acceleration. Other laws of nature also apply in such a system. For instance, a body placed on the Earth remains at rest unless an unbalanced force acts upon it, indicating that the Earth can be considered an inertial frame of reference. A body in a car moving with uniform velocity relative to the Earth also remains at rest, so the car is also an inertial frame of reference. Thus, any frame of reference moving with uniform velocity relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame.
However, if the moving car is suddenly stopped or accelerated, the body inside no longer remains at rest. In such cases, the car is not an inertial frame of reference. Therefore, an accelerated frame of reference is a non-inertial frame. While Earth is rotating and revolving, making it strictly speaking a non-inertial frame, it is often treated as an inertial
frame due to its relatively small acceleration.

### 11.3 SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY

The theory of relativity deals with how observers in different states of relative motion describe physical phenomena. The special theory of relativity addresses problems involving inertial (non-accelerating) frames of reference. There is another theory, called the general theory of relativity, that deals with problems involving frames of reference that are accelerating relative to one another. The special theory of relativity is based on two postulates, which can be stated as follows:
The speed of light $c$ emitted by the flashlight is measured same by two observers, one moving in the car with speed $v$ and other standing on the road.

1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames (Principle of Relativity).
2. The speed of light in free space has the same value for all observers, regardless of the state of motion of the source or the observer (Principle of Constancy of Light).
The first postulate generalizes the fact that all physical laws are the same in frames of reference moving with uniform velocity relative to one another. If the laws of Physics differed for observers in relative motion, those observers could determine which was stationary and which was moving. However, such a distinction does not exist, implying that there is no way to detect absolute uniform motion.
The second postulate states the experimental fact that the speed of light in free space is a universal constant, denoted as $c\left(c=3 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)$. Since $c$ is constant, space and time

become relative. For example, if you are sitting in a train moving at the speed of light and you hold up a mirror in front of you at arm's length, you will still see your reflection in the mirror. This is because, according to the principle of relativity, no experiment can detect the constant motion of the train relative to the person inside it.
These simple postulates have far-reaching consequences. They include phenomena such as the slowing down of clocks and the contraction of lengths in moving reference frames as observed by a stationary observer. Some interesting results of the special theory of relativity can be summarized as follows, without going into their mathematical details.

# The Relativity of Simultaneity

If two events in different locations are observed by one observer to be simultaneous, they will generally not be observed as simultaneous by another observer in a different frame of reference moving relative to the first observer. In other words, whether two events are seen as simultaneous depends on the observer's frame of reference.
Consider a train equipped with light-operated doors. The light switch is located in the centre of the roof and is operated by a traveler standing in the middle of the compartment. When the train is travelling at half the speed of light, the traveler turns on the light. The light travels forward and backward at equal speed and reaches both doors at the same time. Consequently, the traveler sees both doors opening simultaneously. However, an observer outside the train will see the back door open before the front door. This is because the back door is moving towards the light waves, while the front door is moving away from the light waves.

## Time Dilation

If you are in a frame of reference moving at constant velocity from which you cannot see any other frame of reference, there is no way to know if you are moving or at rest.

According to the special theory of relativity, time is not an absolute quantity; it depends on the motion of the frame of reference.
Suppose an observer is stationary in an inertial frame and measures the time interval between two events in this frame. Let this time interval be $t_{0}$. This is known as proper time. If the observer is moving with respect to the frame of events with relativistic velocity $v$, or if the frame of events is moving with respect to the observer with a uniform relativistic velocity $v$, the time measured by the observer will not be $t_{0}$, but rather $t$, given by

$$
t=\frac{t_{0}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}
$$

As the quantity $\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}$ is always less than one, so $t$ is greater than $t_{0}$ i.e., time has dilated or stretched due to the relative motion of the observer and the frame of reference of the events. This astonishing result applies to all timing processes-physical,

chemical, and biological. Even the aging process of the human body is slowed by motion at very high speeds or relativistic speeds.
For example, if a traveler on a plane moving at 0.8 c picks up and opens a book, the event takes one second as measured by the traveler. However, to a person standing outside the plane, the same event takes 1.7 seconds.

# Length Contraction

The distance from Earth to a stermesstured by an observer in a moving spaceship would appear smaller than the distance measured by an observer on the Earth. In other words, if you are in motion relative to two points that are a fixed distance apart, the distance between the two points appears shorter than if you were at rest relative to them. This effect is known as length contraction. Length contraction occurs only along the direction of motion; no such contraction is observed perpendicular to the direction of motion. The length of an object or the distance between two points measured by an observer who is at rest relative to them is called the proper length $\ell_{0}$. If an object and an observer are in relative motion with speed $v$, then the contracted length $l$ is given by

$$
l-l_{0} \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}
$$

Let a train that is measured to be 100 metres long when at rest travel at $80 \%$ of the speed of light ( 0.8 c ). A person inside the train will measure its length as 100 metres. However, a person standing by the side of the track will observe the train to be only 60 metres long. This effect of relativity, which is the shortening of length in the direction of motion, is due to length contraction.

## Mass Variation

According to the special theory of relativity, the mass of an object is a variable quantity that depends on the object's speed. An object whose mass is measured at rest is called its rest mass $m_{s}$, will have an increased mass $m$ when observed to be moving at speed $v$. They are related by

$$
m=\frac{m_{s}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
$$

The increase in mass indicates the increase in inertia that an object has at high speeds. As $v$ approaches $c$, it requires a greater force to change the object's speed.

As

$$
v \rightarrow c, \frac{v}{c} \rightarrow 1, \quad \text { therefore, } \quad \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \rightarrow 0
$$

Thus

$$
m \rightarrow \infty
$$

An infinite mass would require an infinite force to accelerate it. Since infinite forces are not available, an object cannot be accelerated to the speed of light oin free space.
In our everyday life, we deal with speeds that are extremely small compared to the

speed of light. Even Earth's orbital speed is only $30 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, while the speed of light in free space is $300,000 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This is why Newton's laws are valid in everyday situations. However, when dealing with aubatomic particles moving at velocities approaching the speed of light, relativistic effects become very prominent, and experimental results cannot be explained without considering Einstein's equations.

# 11.4 THE EQUILANCE BETWEEN MASS AND ENERGY

According to the special theory of relativity, mass and energy are distinct entities but are interconvertible. The total energy $E$ and mass $m$ of an object are related by the expression:

$$
E=m c^{2}
$$

where $m$ depends on the speed of the object. At rest, the energy equivalent of an object's mass $m_{0}$ is called its rest mass energy $E_{0}$. Thus,

$$
E_{0}=m_{0} c^{2}
$$

As $m c^{2}$ is greater than $m_{0} c^{2}$, the difference of energy $\left(m c^{2}-m_{0} c^{2}\right)$ is due to the motion, and it represents the kinetic energy of the mass. Hence,

$$
K_{1} E_{1}=\left(m-m_{0}\right) c^{2}
$$

From Eq. 11.4, the change in mass $m$ due to change in energy $\Delta E$ is given by

$$
\Delta m=\frac{\Delta E}{c^{2}}
$$

Because $c^{2}$ is a very large quantity, this implies that small changes in mass require very large changes in energy. In our everyday world, energy changes are too small to provide measurable mass changes. However, energy and mass changes in nuclear reactions are found to be exactly in accordance with the aforementioned equations.

### 11.5 SPACE-TIME INRELATIVITY

Space is said to be a three-dimensional extent in which all objects and events occur. It provides a framework to define the position and motion of various objects under the influence of some force.
Time measures the sequence and duration of events. In the theory of relativity, time is not absolute; it is considered the fourth dimension. For example, oscillatory motion, such as that of a swinging pendulum, relies on time to determine the frequency of oscillations. Another example is time dilation, a phenomenon discussed earlier in this chapter, where time passes more slowly for an observer moving at extremely high speeds compared to one at rest. The special theory of relativity explains that space and time are related to each other. It describes how space and time are influenced by gravity and speed, such as the bending of light around massive objects like stars.
Space-time is, in fact, a mathematical model that unifies space-time into a single continuum. It is a concept used to describe all points of space and time and their relation to each other. According to Einstein's theory, space-time is curved especially near

# Physice II

massive bodies and for speeds approaching the speed of light. We can hypothetically visualize this as a fabric sheet. If a heavy ball is placed over this sheet, it curves as shown in Fig. 11.2.
Objects such as stars and planets cause space-time to curve around themselves, much like an elastic fabric deforms when holding a ball. The more massive the object, the deeper the curve.
Fig. 11.2

Consequently, we do not speak of a force of gravity acting on bodies. Instead, we say that bodies and light rays move along geodesics (analogous to straight lines in plane geometry) in curved space-time. Thus, a body at rest or moving slowly near a massive object would follow a geodesic toward that object.
Einstein's theory provides a physical picture of how gravity works. Newton discovered the inverse square law of gravity but explicitly stated that he offered no explanation for why gravity should follow this law. Einstein's theory also describes gravity as following an inverse square law (except in strong gravitational fields), but it explains why this is so. This is why Einstein's theory is considered an advancement over Newton's, even though it encompasses Newton's theory and yields the same results as Newton's theory in all but very strong gravitational fields.
The bending of starlight caused by the Sun's gravity was measured during a solar eclipse in 1919. The results matched Einstein's theory rather than Newton's, leading to Einstein's theory being hailed as a scientific triumph. Another success of Einstein's theory was the detection of gravitational waves, produced by some celestial events causing disturbances (squeezes and stretches) in the curvature of space-time. These waves were detected in 2015 and announced in 2016.
Bending of starlight by the Sun. Light from the star A is deflected as it passes close to the Sun on its way to Earth. We see the star in the apparent direction $B$, shifted by the angle $\phi$. Einstein predicted that $\phi=1.745$ seconds of angle which was found to be the same during the solar eclipse of 1919.

Example 11.1 The period of a pendulum is measured to be 3.0 s in the inertial reference frame of the pendulum. What is its period measured by an observer moving at a speed of $0.95 c$ with respect to the pendulum?

Solution

$$
t=3.0 \mathrm{~s}, \quad v=0.95 \mathrm{c}, \quad t=?
$$

Using

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f=\frac{t_{s}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \\
& f=\frac{3.0 \mathrm{~s}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.95 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}}=\frac{3.0 \mathrm{~s}}{\sqrt{1-(0.95)^{2}}}=9.6 \mathrm{~s}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 11.2 A bar 1.0 m in length and located along $x$-axis moves with a speed of 0.75 c with respect to a stationary observer. What is the length of the bar as measured by the stationary observer?

Solution

$$
t_{1}=1.0 \mathrm{~m}, \quad v=0.75 \mathrm{c}, \quad \ell=\text { ? }
$$

Using

$$
\begin{aligned}
& t=t_{1} \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \\
& t-1.0 \mathrm{~m} \times \sqrt{1-\frac{(0.75 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}-1.0 \mathrm{~m} \times \sqrt{1-(0.75)^{2}}-0.66 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 11.3 Find the mass $m$ of a moving object with speed 0.8 c .

Solution

Using

$$
m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
$$

or

$$
m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-(0.8 c)^{2}}}=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-(0.8)^{2}}}=1.67 m_{0}
$$

## Intereating Information

If you are on some spaceship moving extremely fast through space near a black hole like in movie, "Intersteller" then you could miss 7 years on the Earth in everyhour.

# Hypothelical Example of Space Time

Let a spaceship be travelling to a star with half of the speed of light. Let it takes eight years to reach to the star, from the point of view of the observer on the Earth. From the Earth's point of view, the clocks on the spaceship are moving slowly, so that less time passes on the spaceship compared to the Earth.
For the spaceship occupants, the length of the journey has contracted which they cover in less time. The occupants of the spaceship record 7 years to reach their destination, rather than 8 years.

# Physics II

We believe that all atoms are made up of neutrons, protons, and electrons. The antiparticles of these three particles are also known. The positron (a positive electron), the neutrino, and the photon are also known. By the end of 1960s, many new types of particles similar to the neutron and the proton were discovered. These were called mesons whose masses were mostly less than nucleon masses but more than the electron mass. Afterwards, other mesons were also found that have masses greater than nucleons. Physicists started to look for more fundamental particles which must have even smaller constituents which was later confirmed by experiments. These were named as quarks. We will discuss in this chapter, the basic building blocks of matter.

### 12.1 STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE NUCLEUS

The atomic nucleus comprises two types of particles: protons and neutrons. A proton is the nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen, called a protium. The proton has a positive charge of the same magnitude as that of the electron ( $1.6 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{C}$ ) and its mass is $1.67 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg}$. The neutron, whose existence was pointed out in 1932 by James Chadwick, is electrically neutral as its name suggested and its mass is nearly the same as that of proton. Now we can say that the nucleus has two types of particles (neutrons and protons) called nucleons.

Besides hydrogen, the nuclei of all other elements consist of both neutrons and protons. The different nuclei are called nuclides. The number of protons in a nucleus is called the atomic number represented by the symbol $Z$. The total number of nucleons, the sum of neutrons and protons, is represented by the symbol $A$ and is called the atomic mass number, or simply mass number. It is written as

$$
A=N \cdot \equiv Z
$$

where $N$ represents the neutron number.
In order to specify the given nuclei, the symbol $X$ is commonly used as ${ }_{X}^{A} X$, where $X$ is the chemical symbol for the element. To indicate the mass of atomic particles, instead of kilogram, unified mass scale (u) is generally used. By definition 1 u is exactly one twelveth the mass of carbon-12 atom ( $1 \mathrm{u}=1.6608 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg}=931 \mathrm{MeV}$ ). Using this value of $u$, the mass of a proton is 1.007276 u and that of a neutron is 1.008665 u while that of an electron is 0.00055 u .
For a particular atom (e.g., carbon), nuclei are found to contain different numbers of neutrons, although they all have the same number of protons. For example, carbon nuclei always have 6 protons, but they may have different number of neutrons. Nuclei that contain the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Isotopes of carbon are ${ }_{8}^{12} \mathrm{C},{ }_{6}^{13} \mathrm{C}$, and ${ }_{8}^{14} \mathrm{C}$, amongst them ${ }_{8}^{16} \mathrm{C}$ and ${ }_{8}^{16} \mathrm{C}$ are stable but ${ }_{8}^{14} \mathrm{C}$ is unstable and decays into nitrogen along with the emission of $\beta$ and neutrino

# 12.2 FUNDAMENTAL FORCES OF NATURE

To understand the structure of the nucleus, it is important to know the nature of the forces that bind the nucleon together. But before that, we should know the basic forces in nature. Despite the apparent complexity within the universe, all interactions in the universe are governed by the four basic forces, known as fundamental forces. These forces control how objects move, interact and behave at different scales from nucleons in the atom to massive galaxies. The four fundamental forces are gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force.
Gravitational force or gravity is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is the weakest of the four but it is a long-range force. It is an attractive force and arises due to the gravitational interaction between the bodies. The gravitational force between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. When considered for massive objects, such as the Sun, or giant planets, gravitational force is considered to be significant as the masses of these objects are large. However, on an atomic level, this force is considered to be negligibly weak.
The electromagnetic force is responsible for electric field and magnetic field interactions. Like the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force follows an inverse square law but is much stronger than gravity. It governs a vast range of phenomena, from atomic structure, chemical bonding, electricity, magnetism, and light propagation. James Clerk Maxwell (1861) formulated a set of four fundamental equations named as "Maxwell's equations" that unified electricity and magnetism into electromagnetism. These equations describe how electric and magnetic fields interact and how electromagnetic waves propagate. These equations showed that electric and magnetic fields are not separate forces but are two aspects of a single electromagnetic force.
Out of the four fundamental forces, nuclear forces are the strongest attractive forces. Electromagnetism holds the matter together, but there was no explanation on how the nucleus is held together in the atom. If we only consider the forces of electromagnetism and gravity, the nucleus should fly off in different directions. The stability of the nucleus implies that another force should exist within the nucleus which is stronger than the gravitational force and electromagnetic force. This is where nuclear forces come into play. Strong nuclear forces are responsible for holding the nuclei of atoms together. They only exist inside the nucleus. So, we call them as shortrange forces. The strong nuclear force acts as an attractive force between all nucleons. Thus, protons attract each other via the strong nuclear forces at

the same time they repel each other via the electric force. A neutron, being electrically neutral, can attract other neutrons or protons via the strong nuclear force. Weak nuclear forces are responsible for the radioactive decay, particularly the beta decay and interactions involving neutrino. Unlike the other fundamental forces, the weak force can change the identity of particles, making it essential for processes like nuclear fusion in stars and the decay of unstable atomic nuclei. The relative strength and range of the above four forces are given in Table 12.1.

# 12.3 MATTER AND ANTI-MATTER

It was predicted by Paul Dirac in 1928 that the fundamental particles have their anti-particles. The rest masses of the anti-particles are the same as that of their corresponding particles but with opposite charges and magnetic moments. For example, positron is the antiparticle of an electron. It is represented by $e^{+}$. The rest mass of the positron is the same as that of an electron but it carries positive charge with magnitude the same as that of an electron. It is noted that the positron was the first discovered anti-particle by Anderson in 1932 in a cloud chamber experiment. This was first experimental discovery of an anti-particle. After that a lot of antiparticles were discovered. Usually, the anti-particles are represented by a letter with a bar over it, e.g., anti-proton is represented by $p$ anti-neutrino by $v$ and so on.
The quarks and leptons have been recognized as the fundamental particles also known as elementary particles among the too many discovered particles These elementary particles have also anti-particles.

For your information
1. A particle accelerator is a huge machine that accelerates charged particles, such as electrons, protons, or ions, to extremely high energies and speeds, approaching the speed of light.
2. Linear Accelerators, Cyclotrons and Betatrons are important particle accelerators.

## 12.3.1 For their work on this discovery, Dirac and Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics-Dirac in 1933, and Anderson in 1936. In 1955, Segre and Chamberlain discovered anti-proton using a particle accelerator and were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1959 for their discovery of anti-proton.

## (i) The cosmic rays are high-energy particles coming from the outer-space with unknown sources. Their source may be the Sun or the other stars. These particles consist mostly of protons, neutrons and heavier nuclei, which are continually bombarding the Earth. When these particles interact with the atoms of the gases of the Earth's atmosphere, they produce showers of secondary particles which rain down on us all the time.
(ii) When nuclei of unstable radioactive element say ${ }^{101} \mathrm{U}$ undergo fission reactions in the nuclear reactors, they emit a variety of particles, such as; neutrons, neutrinos, $\alpha$-particles, photons, electrons and positrons.
(iii) When the charged particles, such as electrons and protons are accelerated by an accelerator and then bombarded on the target material, which is hydrogen, these accelerated charged particles may also collide head-on with each other. As a result, the debris from these reactions contain particles like pions, kaons, muons and even anti-protons.

# Pair Production

Pair production occurs when a $\gamma$-ray (high energy photon) passes nearby an atomic nucleus. As a result, an electron-positron pair is emitted as shown in Fig. 12.1. The presence of a third particle, such as a nucleus, is necessary to conserve linear momentum. According to the law of mass-energy equivalence, the minimum energy of a photon for pair production must be equal to the sum of the rest mass energies of the created particles. The rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair is $2 m_{e} c^{2}=1.02 \mathrm{MeV}$ which has been verified experimentally. A gamma ray photon with energy less than 1.02 MeV cannot produce an electron-positron pair whereas a photon with energy greater than 1.02 MeV creates an electron-positron pair and the excess energy goes into the kinetic energies of the particles.
The process of pair production satisfies the laws of conservation of charge, momentum and energy. It can occur for any particle and anti-
particle.

## Annihilation of Matter

It is the opposite process of pair production. For example, when an electron and a positron interact to each other, they annihilate into two gamma ray photons as shown in Fig. 12.2. The reaction can be written as

$$
e^{+} e^{-} \rightarrow \gamma+\gamma
$$

The energy of each gamma ray photon is 0.51 MeV which is equal to the rest mass energy of an electron or a positron, i.e. $E=m_{e} c^{2}$. In an annihilation reaction, energy and momentum are conserved. Besides the electron and positron annihilation, the annihilation reactions of other particles and their anti-particles can also be carried out e.g., proton and anti-proton, lepton and anti-lepton, quark and anti-quark, etc.

Fig. 12.2: Annihilation of matter

A particle accelerator, named as Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN have revealed that some mass of colliding particles is changed to electromagnetic radiation according to Einstein's equation and left over mass appears in the form of new sub-atomic particles (Fig. 12.3).

# 12.4 RADIOACTIVITY

It has been observed that the nuclei whose atomic numbers are greater than 82 are found naturally unstable, and these nuclei spontaneously emit radiations. Such nuclei are called radioactive and the emission of radiation is known as natural radioactivity. These radiations are of three types, $\alpha, \beta$ and $\gamma$-radiations. Unstable isotopes can also be produced artificially in the laboratory by nuclear reactions. This occurs when a stable element is bombarded with high-energy particles, such as neutrons, protons, alpha particles, or gamma rays, causing it to become unstable and emit radiation. This is called artificial radioactivity and radioactive isotopes are named radioisotopes or radionuclides.
The $\alpha$-particles, $\beta$-particles and $\gamma$-radiations are traversed differently when passed through the electric field as shown in Fig. 12.4. It is seen that $\alpha$-particles deflect towards the negative terminal of the electric field, showing that they have a positive charge. The $\alpha$-particles are emitted at high speeds, typically a few percent of the speed of light. However, $\alpha$-particles can travel only several centimetres in the air due to their large mass. The $\beta$-particles deflect towards the positive terminal of the electric field, showing
Fig. 12.4: The three radioactive radiations, namely alpha, beta and gamma rays

they have a negative charge. The deflection of $\beta$-particles is more than the $\alpha$-particles, proving that they are lighter particles than $\alpha$-particles. The $\beta$-particles are fast-moving electrons and move with speeds up to 0.9995 of the speed of light. The $\gamma$-radiations passed through the electric field without deflection, showing that they have no charge. The $\gamma$-radiations are electromagnetic radiations which consist of photons. They move with the speed of light with the highest penetrating power but the lowest ionization power.
The process of emitting $\alpha$-particles, $\beta$-particles and $\gamma$-radiations from the nucleus is called $\alpha$-decay, $\beta$-decay and $\gamma$-decay, respectively, and are discussed below.

# $\alpha$-Decay

If the nucleus has more protons than the number of neutrons, the electrostatic force of repulsion becomes greater than the strong nuclear force of attraction. In this case, the nucleus becomes unstable and emits alpha particles in radioactive decay. An $\alpha$-particle is equivalent to a helium ( He ) nucleus which consists of two protons and two neutrons. This means the nucleus loses two protons and neutrons in the $\alpha$-decay. Hence, the atomic number $Z$ decreases by 2 while its mass number $A$ decreases by 4. Alpha decay can be written in general as:

$$
{ }_{2}^{4} \mathrm{X} \rightarrow{ }_{2-3}^{4} \mathrm{X}+{ }_{3}^{4} \mathrm{He} \ldots \ldots \text { (12.2) }
$$

Here ${ }_{3}^{4} \mathrm{X}$ is the parent nucleus which decays into the daughter nucleus ${ }_{3-9}^{4} \mathrm{X}$ and ${ }_{2}^{4} \mathrm{He}$ is the alpha particle. In the $\alpha$-decay, it is experimentally observed that the number of nucleons (A) and electric charge are conserved. An example of $\alpha$-decay is given below:
A radium-228 isotope ( ${ }_{56}^{228} \mathrm{Ra}$ ) emits an alpha particle and decays into a daughter nucleus radon-222 ( ${ }_{46}^{222} \mathrm{Rn}$ ).

$$
{ }_{56}^{228} \mathrm{Ra} \rightarrow{ }_{46}^{222} \mathrm{Rn}+{ }_{3}^{4} \mathrm{He} \text {. (12.3) }
$$

In the above nuclear reaction, the daughter nucleus ( ${ }_{56}^{222} \mathrm{Rn}$ ) is different from the parent nucleus ( ${ }_{56}^{220} \mathrm{Ra}$ ). This transition of one element into another is called the transmutation of the elements. It is experimentally found that the mass of the parent nucleus is greater than the total mass of the daughter nucleus and the mass of the $\alpha$-particle. Thus, the total mass-energy ( $E=m c^{2}$ ) of the decay products is less than the mass-energy of the original nuclide. This difference in mass-energy is called the disintegration energy $Q$, or the Q-value of the decay.

## $\beta$-Decay

There are two types of $\beta$-decay; $\beta$-decay and $\beta$-decay.

## (i) $\beta$-Decay

Some nuclides have neutron-to-proton ratio (N/P) too large and are the source of $\beta$-decay. The $\beta$-particles are not the orbital electrons but they are created within the nucleus at the moment of emission. In this process, a neutron in the nucleus decays into

a proton and an electron, plus another particle called anti-neutrino which is the antiparticle of neutrino. The neutrino is denoted by a Greek symbol $v$ (nu) and anti-neutrino is denoted by a bar over the $\bar{v}$. The decay process is given by the following relation:

$$
{ }_{n}^{+} n \rightarrow{ }_{1}^{1} p+{ }_{n}^{+} e+\bar{v}
$$

One of the neutrons changes to a proton and in order to conserve charge it emits an electron. These electrons are called beta particles. However, they are indistinguishable from orbital electrons. Both the neutrino and the anti-neutrino have zero charge and very small mass, that is why they are very difficult to observe when passing through the matter. No nucleons are lost when a $\beta$-particle is emitted, and the total number of nucleons A remains the same but the mass number $Z$ changes. Beta decay process can be written as:

$$
{ }_{Z}^{A} X \rightarrow{ }_{2+}+{ }_{n}^{+} e+\bar{v}
$$

From the above equation, it is clear that the parent element of atomic number $Z$ is transmuted to another element of atomic number ( $Z+1$ ). An example is the isotope of thorium, which is unstable and decays into protactinium by beta emission. The reaction is represented as:

$$
{ }_{2}^{A} \mathrm{Th} \rightarrow{ }_{91}^{238} \mathrm{~Pa}+{ }_{1}^{+} e+\bar{v}
$$

## For reachormation

The neutrino was first proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to obey the energy conservation in the betamirua and beta-plus decays. Later in 1953, neutrino was detected by F. Reines and C. L. Cowan in a high-power nuclear reactor. On this discovery, F. Reines received the Nobel prize in 1995.

# (ii) $\beta^{-}$-Decay

There are also nuclides that have neutron-to-proton ratio (N/P) too small for stability and decay by emitting a positron instead of an electron. The positron (e+) has the same mass as the electron but it has a positive charge. The positron is the anti-particle of the electron. In this process, a proton in the nucleus decays into a neutron and a positron, plus a neutrino. The generalized decay is given below:

$$
{ }_{Z}^{0} X \rightarrow{ }_{Z+}^{A} X+{ }_{4}^{0} e+v
$$

An example of a decay of Neon into Flourine by emitting positron and neutrino is:

$$
{ }_{10}^{12} \mathrm{Ne} \rightarrow{ }_{0}^{12} \mathrm{~F}+{ }_{4}^{0} e+v
$$

## Energy of Alpha and Beta Particles in Radioactive Decay

In both $\alpha$-decay and $\beta$-decay, for a particular radionuclide, the same amount of energy is released. In $\alpha$-decay of a particular radionuclide, every emitted $\alpha$-particle has the same sharply defined kinetic energy. When the number of $\alpha$-particles is plotted against kinetic energy, there are distinct spikes that appear on the graph as shown in Fig. 12.5. This demonstrates that $\alpha$-particles have discrete energies.
Fig. 12.5: Discrete energy values of $\alpha$-particles

However, in the case of $\beta$-particle emission, energy is shared between $\beta$-particle and antineutrino in varying proportions. The sum of electron (or positron) energy and the antineutrino's (or neutrino's) energy, however, in every case remains the same. Thus, in $\beta$-decay, the energy of an electron or a positron may range from zero to a maximum value. When the number of $\beta$-particles is plotted against kinetic energy, the graph shows a curve as shown in Fig. 12.6. This demonstrates that beta particles
Kinetic energy (eV)
Fig. 12.6: Continuous spectrum of $\beta$-particles
(electrons or positrons) have a continuous range of energies. The principle of conservation of momentum and energy applies in both alpha and beta emission.

# (III) $\gamma$-Radiation

The emission of $\gamma$-radiation from a nucleus is generally represented by this equation:

$$
\Sigma \rightarrow \Sigma X+\gamma
$$

where $\Sigma \vec{X}$ represents an excited nucleus while $\Sigma \vec{X}$ shows ground state of the nucleus.

### 12.5 FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES

By the term fundamental particle, we mean a particle that has no internal structure, which means that it is indivisible. Presently, the fundamental constituents of matter are considered to be quarks (protons, neutrons and mesons are made up of quarks) and leptons (including electrons, positrons, and neutrinos). They are considered the basic

# phystes 11

## 12 Nudear and Pettide Physios

building blocks of matter.
When a nucleus is smashed in an ultra high energy particle accelerator, or two high energy particles are collided, entirely new types of particles are created which apparently do not exist within the atoms of the ordinary matter. They are the outcome of the violent collisions needed to probe the basic structure of matter. More than a hundred new particles have been identified to be classified into families with similar properties. Many of these were accounted well with the scheme of theoretical physicist while the rest were named "strange particle". They are always created in pairs, e.g., when a pion ( $\pi$ ) collides with a proton, two strange particles $k^{\circ}$ (Kaon), and $\Lambda^{\circ}$ (Lamda) are created. The nuclear reaction is:

$$
\pi^{\prime}+\mathrm{p} \rightarrow \mathrm{k}^{\circ}+\Lambda^{\circ}
$$

All particles spin on their axes and the spin of charged particles makes them tiny magnets. The characteristic spin of electrons, protons, neutrons is $1 / 2$ and the spin of photon is 1 and of pions is taken as zero. Half spin particles obey the Pauli's exclusion principle which says that only one particle of a kind occupies a given quantum state. These particles are called "fermions". The particles with zero or whole number spin do not obey this principle. They are called "bosons", as they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. Further major classifications are:

1. The nucleons and the heavier particles such as $\Lambda^{\circ}$ and $k^{\circ}$ which decay to nucleons are called "baryons" (heavy).
2. The particles that do not interact strongly with nucleons, and are called leptons (small) along with the electrons, lau and neutrino.
Both of the $\beta$-decay (beta-minus and beta-plus) processes provide evidence that the protons and neutrons are not the fundamental particles. By the 1960s many new types of particles similar to the neutron and proton were discovered, as well as many "midsized" particles called mesons whose masses were mostly less than nucleon masses but more than the electron mass (other mesons, found later, have masses greater than nucleons). The strongly attractive particles are called $\pi$ meson or pions while the weakly interacting particles were named $\mu$ mesons or muons.
This discovery led to the conclusion that these particles could not be fundamental particles, and must be made up of even smaller constituents, which were given the name quarks.

## Hadrons and Leptons

Particles can also be classified based on the four fundamental forces that act on them. While the gravitational force affects all particles. Its impact at the subatomic level is so minimal that it is generally disregarded at the sub-atomic level. The electromagnetic force, which acts on all electrically charged particles, is well understood and can be considered when necessary; however, in this chapter, we will largely ignore its effects.
Particles can be broadly classified based on whether they interact via the strong force or

do not. Those that experience the strong force are known as hadrons, while those that do not, are called leptons. Examples of hadrons include protons, neutrons, and pions, whereas electrons and neutrinos are classified as leptons.
Hadrons are composite subatomic particles that can be further divided into two broad categories: some are bosons, referred to as mesons such as pion, while others are fermions, known as baryons, with protons and neutrons being the key examples. Baryons are made of an odd number of quarks (usually three quarks), and mesons are made up of an even number of quarks (usually two quarks: one quark and one antiquark).
The leptons interact only through weak or electromagnetic interactions. No experiments have yet been able to reveal any internal structure for the leptons; they appear to be truly fundamental particles that cannot be split into smaller particles. All known leptons have spin $1 / 2$, so they all are fermions. The six known leptons are grouped as three pairs of particles as shown in Table 12.3. Each pair includes a charged particle $\left(e, \mu^{\prime}, \tau^{\prime}\right)$, its associated neutrino and corresponding anti-particles. Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium, while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. The best-known of all leptons is the electron.

# 12.6 QUARKS

In 1964, M. Gell-Mann and George Zweig proposed that none of the hadrons, not even the proton and neutron, are truly fundamental, but instead are made up of combinations of three more fundamental entities called quarks or quark flavours. Quarks are considered to be truly fundamental particles, like leptons. Three quarks originally proposed were named up, down, and strange, with abbreviations $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{s}$, respectively. Presently, we are aware of six quarks, just as there are six leptons-based on a presumed symmetry in nature. The other three quarks are called charm, bottom, and top ( $\mathbf{c}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{t}$ ). These new quarks can be distinguished from the 3 original quarks (Table 12.4). All quarks have a spin and an electric charge (a fraction of the previously thought smallest charge eon an electron). Quarks are invisible. They never appear on their own.

All hadrons are considered to be made up of combinations of quarks (plus the gluons that hold them together), and their properties are described by looking at their quark content. Mesons consist of a quark-antiquark pair. For example, $a \pi^{\circ}$ meson is a ud combination. $A \pi^{\circ}$ can be made of uü).
Each baryon, on the other hand, consists of three quarks, such as:
The proton has a quark composition of uud and so its charge quantum number is:
$q($ uud $)=\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{3}+\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)=+1$
Neutron has a quark composition of udd and Its charge quantum number is:
$q($ udd $)=\frac{2}{3}+\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)+(-\frac{1}{3})=0$

| Table 12.4: Quark flavours |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Particles | Symbol | Charge <br> (q) | Mass <br> (MeV/ $\mathrm{E}^{\prime}$ ) | Antl. <br> Particle | Charge <br> (q) |
| Up | u | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 5 | m | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Down | d | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 10 | d | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |
| Charm | c | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 1500 | c | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Strange | s | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 200 | s | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |
| Top | t | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 175000 | t | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Bottom | b | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 4300 | b | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |

Mesons are quark-antiquark pairs. Consider the meson $\pi^{\circ}$, which consists of an upquark u and an antidown quark d. We see that the charge quantum number of the up quark is $+2 / 3$ and that of the antidown quark is $+1 / 3$. This edda nicely to a charge quantum number of +1 for the $\pi^{\circ}$ meson; that is, $q(u)=2 / 3+1 / 3=+1$.

Not long after the quark theory was proposed, it was suggested that quarks have another property (or quality) called colour, or "colour charge" (analogous to electric charge). According to this theory, each flavour of quark can have one of three colours, usually designated red, green, and blue. Note that the names "colour" and "flavour" have nothing to do with our senses, but are purely whimsical-as are other names, such as charm, in this new field. The anti-quarks are coloured antired, antigreen, and antiblue. Baryons are made up of three quarks, one of each colour. Mesons consist of a quark-anti-quark pair
Fig. 12.7 (a): Colourless baryons: blue + red + green $=$ white

Anti-proton
Fig. 12.7 (b): A colourless anti-baryons: anti-blue + anti-red + anti-green = white

of a particular colour and its anti-colour. Both baryons and mesons are thus colourless or white. Each quark is assumed to carry a colour charge, analogous to an electric charge, and the strong force between quarks is referred to as the colour force. This theory of the strong force is called quantum chromodynamics or QCD, to indicate that the force acts between colour charges (and not between, say, electric charges). The strong force between two hadrons is considered to be a force between the quarks that make them up.

# Beta Decay in Terms of Quarks

When a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton and an electron (beta particle), an anti-neutrino is also produced in the reaction and the decay process is given as:

$$
{ }_{n}^{1} n \rightarrow{ }_{1}^{1} p+{ }_{1}^{2} e+\bar{v}
$$

Now, we can identify that a neutron with composition udd can convert into a proton with composition uud by changing a down quark into an up quark. The fundamental decay process can now be expressed as:

$$
d \rightarrow u+{ }_{1}^{2} e+\bar{v}
$$

Thus, as our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter deepens, we can analyze familiar processes at increasingly intricate levels. The quark model not only enhances our comprehension of particle structures but also provides insight into their interactions.

### 12.7 HIGGS BOSON

Fundamental particles are considered to be the six quarks, the six leptons and the gauge bosons (Higgs bosons), which are the carriers of the fundamental forces. Leptons and quarks interact with each other by sending and receiving bosons. For example, electromagnetic interactions occur when two positively charged particles send and receive (exchange) photons. The photons are said to "carry" the force between charged particles. Likewise, attraction between two quarks in an atomic nucleus occurs when two quarks send and receive gluons. Similarly, the $\mathrm{W}^{\prime}, \mathrm{W}$ and Z are the bosons that are the carriers of weak nuclear force and gravitons are the carriers of gravitational force. The Higgs boson is a special particle discovered in 2012 at large hadron collider at CERN. It is associated with the Higg's field that permeates all of the space. Its crucial role is that it provides explanation for how the other particles get mass by interacting with it.
The particles that interact strongly with Higg's field get more mass such as carriers of electroweak interaction i.e., $\mathrm{W}^{\prime}, \mathrm{W}$ and Z bosons whereas the particles like photons do not interact with Higg's field and hence, their rest mass is considered zero. Higgs boson has a mass of around 125 giga-electron-volts ( $\mathrm{GeV} / \mathrm{c}^{2}$ ) and decays rapidly into other particles. Here are some key facts:

1. The Higgs boson gets its mass from its interactions with its associated Higg's field.
2. It can be a unique portal to find the conditions of universe shortly after the Big Bang and signs of dark matter due to its distinctive characteristics and properties.

# 12.8 CONSERVATION LAWS

All nuclear processess such as nuclear reactions and nuclear decays obey conservation laws such as:

1. conservation of energy, momentum and charge. It includes the nucleon number N and charge number Z.
2. baryon number
3. lepton number

### 12.9 THE ASYMMETRY OF MATTER AND ANTI-MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE

Many observations show that there is the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter. This is the most remarkable features of our universe. A number of hypothesis are existed which show that the universe consists almost entirely of matter rather than anti-matter. e.g., the universe is assumed to be composed up $5 \%$ of ordinary matter (electrons, protons and neutrons), $71 \%$ of hydrogen atoms and $24 \%$ of helium atoms, there are no any contribution of anti-hydrogen or anti-helium atoms in the composition of the universe.
The experimental results explain that the matter and anti-matter asymmetry is indeed due to the violation of conservation of baryon number. i.e., there is imbalance number of baryons and its anti-baryons. Now if the particle-antiparticle symmetry is also violated, then there will be a mechanism for making more quarks than anti-quarks, more leptons than anti-leptons and eventually more matter than anti-matter. Hence, it is concluded that the problem asymmetry of matter and anti-matter is still mystery.

### 12.10 MOST OF THE MATTER IN THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE IS PLASMA

Our universe is more vast than our thinking, because we still know about its $5 \%$ part but we still do not know about its remaining $95 \%$ part. For example, our universe consists of about $27 \%$ of unknown matter called dark matter and about $68 \%$ a mysterious antigravity material known as dark energy. By adding $27 \%$ and $68 \%$ we have $95 \%$. It means $95 \%$ universe is out of our thinking, i.e., we know nothing about $95 \%$ of the universe.

On the other hand, the $5 \%$ of the universe that we know about it, is an ordinary

matter, where hydrogen and helium are almost in the plasma state. Therefore, these figures indicate that $95 \%$ of the $5 \%$ of the observable universe is the plasma state, while the remaining $5 \%$ is in the form of matter. Hence, it is concluded that most of the matter in the observable universe is plasma.

# 12.11 THE THEORIES ABOUT THE FORCES BETWEEN THE MASSES OF PARTICLES

To explain the interactions between the masses of the particles through different mediators, we have the following two theories, the quantum field theory and the string theory.

## 1. The Quantum Field Theory

According to this theory, each particle is represented by a field called quantum field and it is responsible to transmit a force from one particle to another by a mediator. For example, let a positively charged particle produces an electric field in the space around it. This charged particle exerts an attractive force on a nearby negatively charged particle through its field. Moreover, the field can also carry energy and momentum from one particle to another. Where the energy and momentum of all fields are quantized. The quanta that exchange momentum and energy from one type of particle to another in their field are called field particles. Thus, we can say that the interactions between particles are described in terms of the exchange of field particle or quanta which are all bosons. For example, the electromagnetic force is mediated by photons called quanta of the electromagnetic field. Similarly, the strong nuclear force is mediated by field particles called gluons, the electro-weak force is mediated by the field particles called Bosons ( $W^{\prime}$ and $Z$ ) and the gravitational forces is mediated by field particles called gravitons.

## 2. String Theory

String Theory is an advanced concept in theoretical physics proposing that the fundamental particles of the universe, instead of being point-like, are actually tiny, vibrating strings. These strings can be open or closed loops, and their vibrations
determine the properties of particles, including mass and force. String Theory framework, offering a potential theory of everything, still remains unproved experimentally.

# 12.12 THESTANDARD MODEL

The standard model is the collection of theories that describe the smallest experimentally observed particles of matter and interaction between energy and matter. Three categories of particles form the standard model are shown in Fig. 12.8. Matter, which makes up only $5 \%$ of the universe is composed of quarks and leptons. The fundamental bosons provide three forces: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force.

The Higg's boson provides an explanation for how the other particles get mass.
This model is still considered incomplete. Currently, it is unable to explain many important features of the known universe such as: (i) gravity (ii) dark matter ( $27 \%$ of the universe (iii) dark energy ( $68 \%$ of the universe).
