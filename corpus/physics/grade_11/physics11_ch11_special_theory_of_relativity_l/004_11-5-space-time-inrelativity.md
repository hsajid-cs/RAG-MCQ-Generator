### 11.5 SPACE-TIME INRELATIVITY

Space is said to be a three-dimensional extent in which all objects and events occur. It provides a framework to define the position and motion of various objects under the influence of some force.
Time measures the sequence and duration of events. In the theory of relativity, time is not absolute; it is considered the fourth dimension. For example, oscillatory motion, such as that of a swinging pendulum, relies on time to determine the frequency of oscillations. Another example is time dilation, a phenomenon discussed earlier in this chapter, where time passes more slowly for an observer moving at extremely high speeds compared to one at rest. The special theory of relativity explains that space and time are related to each other. It describes how space and time are influenced by gravity and speed, such as the bending of light around massive objects like stars.
Space-time is, in fact, a mathematical model that unifies space-time into a single continuum. It is a concept used to describe all points of space and time and their relation to each other. According to Einstein's theory, space-time is curved especially near

massive bodies and for speeds approaching the speed of light. We can hypothetically visualize this as a fabric sheet. If a heavy ball is placed over this sheet, it curves as shown in Fig. 11.2.
Objects such as stars and planets cause space-time to curve around themselves, much like an elastic fabric deforms when holding a ball. The more massive the object, the deeper the curve.
Fig. 11.2

Consequently, we do not speak of a force of gravity acting on bodies. Instead, we say that bodies and light rays move along geodesics (analogous to straight lines in plane geometry) in curved space-time. Thus, a body at rest or moving slowly near a massive object would follow a geodesic toward that object.
Einstein's theory provides a physical picture of how gravity works. Newton discovered the inverse square law of gravity but explicitly stated that he offered no explanation for why gravity should follow this law. Einstein's theory also describes gravity as following an inverse square law (except in strong gravitational fields), but it explains why this is so. This is why Einstein's theory is considered an advancement over Newton's, even though it encompasses Newton's theory and yields the same results as Newton's theory in all but very strong gravitational fields.
The bending of starlight caused by the Sun's gravity was measured during a solar eclipse in 1919. The results matched Einstein's theory rather than Newton's, leading to Einstein's theory being hailed as a scientific triumph. Another success of Einstein's theory was the detection of gravitational waves, produced by some celestial events causing disturbances (squeezes and stretches) in the curvature of space-time. These waves were detected in 2015 and announced in 2016.
Bending of starlight by the Sun. Light from the star A is deflected as it passes close to the Sun on its way to Earth. We see the star in the apparent direction $B$, shifted by the angle $\phi$. Einstein predicted that $\phi=1.745$ seconds of angle which was found to be the same during the solar eclipse of 1919.

Example 11.1 The period of a pendulum is measured to be 3.0 s in the inertial reference frame of the pendulum. What is its period measured by an observer moving at a speed of $0.95 c$ with respect to the pendulum?

Solution

$$
t=3.0 \mathrm{~s}, \quad v=0.95 \mathrm{c}, \quad t=?
$$

Using

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f=\frac{t_{s}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \\
& f=\frac{3.0 \mathrm{~s}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.95 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}}=\frac{3.0 \mathrm{~s}}{\sqrt{1-(0.95)^{2}}}=9.6 \mathrm{~s}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 11.2 A bar 1.0 m in length and located along $x$-axis moves with a speed of 0.75 c with respect to a stationary observer. What is the length of the bar as measured by the stationary observer?

Solution

$$
t_{1}=1.0 \mathrm{~m}, \quad v=0.75 \mathrm{c}, \quad \ell=\text { ? }
$$

Using

$$
\begin{aligned}
& t=t_{1} \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \\
& t-1.0 \mathrm{~m} \times \sqrt{1-\frac{(0.75 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}-1.0 \mathrm{~m} \times \sqrt{1-(0.75)^{2}}-0.66 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 11.3 Find the mass $m$ of a moving object with speed 0.8 c .

Solution

Using

$$
m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
$$

or

$$
m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-(0.8 c)^{2}}}=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-(0.8)^{2}}}=1.67 m_{0}
$$

## Intereating Information

If you are on some spaceship moving extremely fast through space near a black hole like in movie, "Intersteller" then you could miss 7 years on the Earth in everyhour.

# Hypothelical Example of Space Time

Let a spaceship be travelling to a star with half of the speed of light. Let it takes eight years to reach to the star, from the point of view of the observer on the Earth. From the Earth's point of view, the clocks on the spaceship are moving slowly, so that less time passes on the spaceship compared to the Earth.
For the spaceship occupants, the length of the journey has contracted which they cover in less time. The occupants of the spaceship record 7 years to reach their destination, rather than 8 years.

# Physics II

We believe that all atoms are made up of neutrons, protons, and electrons. The antiparticles of these three particles are also known. The positron (a positive electron), the neutrino, and the photon are also known. By the end of 1960s, many new types of particles similar to the neutron and the proton were discovered. These were called mesons whose masses were mostly less than nucleon masses but more than the electron mass. Afterwards, other mesons were also found that have masses greater than nucleons. Physicists started to look for more fundamental particles which must have even smaller constituents which was later confirmed by experiments. These were named as quarks. We will discuss in this chapter, the basic building blocks of matter.
