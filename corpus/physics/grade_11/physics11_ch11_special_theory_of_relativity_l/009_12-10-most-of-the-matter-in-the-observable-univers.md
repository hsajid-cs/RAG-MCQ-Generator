### 12.10 MOST OF THE MATTER IN THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE IS PLASMA

Our universe is more vast than our thinking, because we still know about its $5 \%$ part but we still do not know about its remaining $95 \%$ part. For example, our universe consists of about $27 \%$ of unknown matter called dark matter and about $68 \%$ a mysterious antigravity material known as dark energy. By adding $27 \%$ and $68 \%$ we have $95 \%$. It means $95 \%$ universe is out of our thinking, i.e., we know nothing about $95 \%$ of the universe.

On the other hand, the $5 \%$ of the universe that we know about it, is an ordinary

matter, where hydrogen and helium are almost in the plasma state. Therefore, these figures indicate that $95 \%$ of the $5 \%$ of the observable universe is the plasma state, while the remaining $5 \%$ is in the form of matter. Hence, it is concluded that most of the matter in the observable universe is plasma.

# 12.11 THE THEORIES ABOUT THE FORCES BETWEEN THE MASSES OF PARTICLES

To explain the interactions between the masses of the particles through different mediators, we have the following two theories, the quantum field theory and the string theory.

## 1. The Quantum Field Theory

According to this theory, each particle is represented by a field called quantum field and it is responsible to transmit a force from one particle to another by a mediator. For example, let a positively charged particle produces an electric field in the space around it. This charged particle exerts an attractive force on a nearby negatively charged particle through its field. Moreover, the field can also carry energy and momentum from one particle to another. Where the energy and momentum of all fields are quantized. The quanta that exchange momentum and energy from one type of particle to another in their field are called field particles. Thus, we can say that the interactions between particles are described in terms of the exchange of field particle or quanta which are all bosons. For example, the electromagnetic force is mediated by photons called quanta of the electromagnetic field. Similarly, the strong nuclear force is mediated by field particles called gluons, the electro-weak force is mediated by the field particles called Bosons ( $W^{\prime}$ and $Z$ ) and the gravitational forces is mediated by field particles called gravitons.

## 2. String Theory

String Theory is an advanced concept in theoretical physics proposing that the fundamental particles of the universe, instead of being point-like, are actually tiny, vibrating strings. These strings can be open or closed loops, and their vibrations
determine the properties of particles, including mass and force. String Theory framework, offering a potential theory of everything, still remains unproved experimentally.

# 12.12 THESTANDARD MODEL

The standard model is the collection of theories that describe the smallest experimentally observed particles of matter and interaction between energy and matter. Three categories of particles form the standard model are shown in Fig. 12.8. Matter, which makes up only $5 \%$ of the universe is composed of quarks and leptons. The fundamental bosons provide three forces: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force.

The Higg's boson provides an explanation for how the other particles get mass.
This model is still considered incomplete. Currently, it is unable to explain many important features of the known universe such as: (i) gravity (ii) dark matter ( $27 \%$ of the universe (iii) dark energy ( $68 \%$ of the universe).
