### 12.5 FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES

By the term fundamental particle, we mean a particle that has no internal structure, which means that it is indivisible. Presently, the fundamental constituents of matter are considered to be quarks (protons, neutrons and mesons are made up of quarks) and leptons (including electrons, positrons, and neutrinos). They are considered the basic

building blocks of matter.
When a nucleus is smashed in an ultra high energy particle accelerator, or two high energy particles are collided, entirely new types of particles are created which apparently do not exist within the atoms of the ordinary matter. They are the outcome of the violent collisions needed to probe the basic structure of matter. More than a hundred new particles have been identified to be classified into families with similar properties. Many of these were accounted well with the scheme of theoretical physicist while the rest were named "strange particle". They are always created in pairs, e.g., when a pion ( $\pi$ ) collides with a proton, two strange particles $k^{\circ}$ (Kaon), and $\Lambda^{\circ}$ (Lamda) are created. The nuclear reaction is:

$$
\pi^{\prime}+\mathrm{p} \rightarrow \mathrm{k}^{\circ}+\Lambda^{\circ}
$$

All particles spin on their axes and the spin of charged particles makes them tiny magnets. The characteristic spin of electrons, protons, neutrons is $1 / 2$ and the spin of photon is 1 and of pions is taken as zero. Half spin particles obey the Pauli's exclusion principle which says that only one particle of a kind occupies a given quantum state. These particles are called "fermions". The particles with zero or whole number spin do not obey this principle. They are called "bosons", as they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. Further major classifications are:

1. The nucleons and the heavier particles such as $\Lambda^{\circ}$ and $k^{\circ}$ which decay to nucleons are called "baryons" (heavy).
2. The particles that do not interact strongly with nucleons, and are called leptons (small) along with the electrons, lau and neutrino.
Both of the $\beta$-decay (beta-minus and beta-plus) processes provide evidence that the protons and neutrons are not the fundamental particles. By the 1960s many new types of particles similar to the neutron and proton were discovered, as well as many "midsized" particles called mesons whose masses were mostly less than nucleon masses but more than the electron mass (other mesons, found later, have masses greater than nucleons). The strongly attractive particles are called $\pi$ meson or pions while the weakly interacting particles were named $\mu$ mesons or muons.
This discovery led to the conclusion that these particles could not be fundamental particles, and must be made up of even smaller constituents, which were given the name quarks.

## Hadrons and Leptons

Particles can also be classified based on the four fundamental forces that act on them. While the gravitational force affects all particles. Its impact at the subatomic level is so minimal that it is generally disregarded at the sub-atomic level. The electromagnetic force, which acts on all electrically charged particles, is well understood and can be considered when necessary; however, in this chapter, we will largely ignore its effects.
Particles can be broadly classified based on whether they interact via the strong force or

do not. Those that experience the strong force are known as hadrons, while those that do not, are called leptons. Examples of hadrons include protons, neutrons, and pions, whereas electrons and neutrinos are classified as leptons.
Hadrons are composite subatomic particles that can be further divided into two broad categories: some are bosons, referred to as mesons such as pion, while others are fermions, known as baryons, with protons and neutrons being the key examples. Baryons are made of an odd number of quarks (usually three quarks), and mesons are made up of an even number of quarks (usually two quarks: one quark and one antiquark).
The leptons interact only through weak or electromagnetic interactions. No experiments have yet been able to reveal any internal structure for the leptons; they appear to be truly fundamental particles that cannot be split into smaller particles. All known leptons have spin $1 / 2$, so they all are fermions. The six known leptons are grouped as three pairs of particles as shown in Table 12.3. Each pair includes a charged particle $\left(e, \mu^{\prime}, \tau^{\prime}\right)$, its associated neutrino and corresponding anti-particles. Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium, while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. The best-known of all leptons is the electron.

# 12.6 QUARKS

In 1964, M. Gell-Mann and George Zweig proposed that none of the hadrons, not even the proton and neutron, are truly fundamental, but instead are made up of combinations of three more fundamental entities called quarks or quark flavours. Quarks are considered to be truly fundamental particles, like leptons. Three quarks originally proposed were named up, down, and strange, with abbreviations $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{s}$, respectively. Presently, we are aware of six quarks, just as there are six leptons-based on a presumed symmetry in nature. The other three quarks are called charm, bottom, and top ( $\mathbf{c}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{t}$ ). These new quarks can be distinguished from the 3 original quarks (Table 12.4). All quarks have a spin and an electric charge (a fraction of the previously thought smallest charge eon an electron). Quarks are invisible. They never appear on their own.

All hadrons are considered to be made up of combinations of quarks (plus the gluons that hold them together), and their properties are described by looking at their quark content. Mesons consist of a quark-antiquark pair. For example, $a \pi^{\circ}$ meson is a ud combination. $A \pi^{\circ}$ can be made of uü).
Each baryon, on the other hand, consists of three quarks, such as:
The proton has a quark composition of uud and so its charge quantum number is:
$q($ uud $)=\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{3}+\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)=+1$
Neutron has a quark composition of udd and Its charge quantum number is:
$q($ udd $)=\frac{2}{3}+\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)+(-\frac{1}{3})=0$

| Particles | Symbol | Charge <br> (q) | Mass <br> (MeV/ $\mathrm{E}^{\prime}$ ) | Antl. <br> Particle | Charge <br> (q) |
| Up | u | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 5 | m | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Down | d | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 10 | d | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |
| Charm | c | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 1500 | c | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Strange | s | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 200 | s | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |
| Top | t | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 175000 | t | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Bottom | b | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 4300 | b | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |

Mesons are quark-antiquark pairs. Consider the meson $\pi^{\circ}$, which consists of an upquark u and an antidown quark d. We see that the charge quantum number of the up quark is $+2 / 3$ and that of the antidown quark is $+1 / 3$. This edda nicely to a charge quantum number of +1 for the $\pi^{\circ}$ meson; that is, $q(u)=2 / 3+1 / 3=+1$.

Not long after the quark theory was proposed, it was suggested that quarks have another property (or quality) called colour, or "colour charge" (analogous to electric charge). According to this theory, each flavour of quark can have one of three colours, usually designated red, green, and blue. Note that the names "colour" and "flavour" have nothing to do with our senses, but are purely whimsical-as are other names, such as charm, in this new field. The anti-quarks are coloured antired, antigreen, and antiblue. Baryons are made up of three quarks, one of each colour. Mesons consist of a quark-anti-quark pair

Anti-proton

of a particular colour and its anti-colour. Both baryons and mesons are thus colourless or white. Each quark is assumed to carry a colour charge, analogous to an electric charge, and the strong force between quarks is referred to as the colour force. This theory of the strong force is called quantum chromodynamics or QCD, to indicate that the force acts between colour charges (and not between, say, electric charges). The strong force between two hadrons is considered to be a force between the quarks that make them up.

# Beta Decay in Terms of Quarks

When a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton and an electron (beta particle), an anti-neutrino is also produced in the reaction and the decay process is given as:

$$
{ }_{n}^{1} n \rightarrow{ }_{1}^{1} p+{ }_{1}^{2} e+\bar{v}
$$

Now, we can identify that a neutron with composition udd can convert into a proton with composition uud by changing a down quark into an up quark. The fundamental decay process can now be expressed as:

$$
d \rightarrow u+{ }_{1}^{2} e+\bar{v}
$$

Thus, as our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter deepens, we can analyze familiar processes at increasingly intricate levels. The quark model not only enhances our comprehension of particle structures but also provides insight into their interactions.
