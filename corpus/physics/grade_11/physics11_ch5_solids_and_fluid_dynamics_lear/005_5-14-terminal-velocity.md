### 5.14 TERMINAL VELOCITY

A chimney works best when it is tall and exposed to air currents, which reduces the pressure at the top and forces the upward flow of smoke.

Consider a water droplet having radius $r$ such as that of fog falling vertically, the air drag on the water droplet increases with speed. The droplet accelerates rapidly under the over powering force of gravity which pulls the droplet rapidly downward due to force of gravity. However, the upward drag force on it increases as the speed of the droplet

increases. The net force on the droplet is
Net force $=$ Weight - Drag force
As the speed of the droplet continues to increase, the drag force eventually approaches the weight in the magnitude. Finally, when the magnitude of the drag force becomes equal to the weight, the net force acting on the droplet is zero. Then the droplet will fall with constant speed called terminal velocity.
To find the terminal velocity $v$, in this case, we use Stokes' law for the drag force. Equating it to the weight of the drop, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 0=m g-6 \pi \eta r v_{1} \\
& v_{1}=\frac{m g}{6 \pi \eta r}
\end{aligned}
$$

The mass of the droplet is $\rho V$, where $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$ is the volume of the sphere.
Substituting above values in the Eq. (5.28), we have

$$
v_{1}=\frac{2 g r^{2} \rho}{9 \eta}
$$

(5.29)

Example 5.5 A tiny water droplet of radius 0.010 cm descends through air from a high building. Calculate its terminal velocity. Given that $\eta$ for air $=19 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and density of water $p=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$.

$$
r=1.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}, \quad \rho=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}, \quad \eta=19 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

Putting the above values in Eq. (5.29)

$$
v_{1}=\frac{2 \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2} \times\left(1.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}\right)^{2} \times 1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}}{9 \times 19 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}
$$

Terminal velocity $=1.1 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.

# 5.15 REAL FLUIDS ARE VISCOUS FLUIDS

## Ideal fluid

It is a fluid that does not have viscosity and cannot be compressed. This type of fluid cannot exist practically.

## Real fluid

All types of fluids that possess viscosity are termed as real fluids.
Examples: Kerosene oil, castor oil and honey etc.

## Comparison of Ideal and Real Fluids

An example of ideal fluid cannot be provided because it does not exist in the real world.

However, every fluid that we see around us like water, diesel, petrol, honey, etc. are real fluids. Moreover, differences in viscosity can be found in real life, for example, honey is more viscous than water. Bernoulli's equation states that the speed of fluid flow is increased as a result of a simultaneous decrease in the potential energy of the fluid or a decrease in the static pressure on the fluid. When a fluid is viscous, it essentially refers to the thickness of the fluid or the friction, the fluid faces while fluid flows. Therefore, ideal fluids do not face the opposing force and have a non-viscous flow, while real fluids have a viscous flow. Ideal fluids are incompressible. It is not also subjected to surface tension.

# 5.16 SUPERFLUIDS

Superfluidity is the characteristic property of fluids with zero viscosity i.e., flow is frictionless. A substance exhibiting this property is a superfluid. Superfluids flow without loss of kinetic energy. They can flow through incredibly narrow spaces without any friction.

Superfluidity is achieved in some substances at extremely low temperature. For example, in fluid dynamics, a vortex is region in a fluid in which the flow revolves around an axial line, which may be straight or curved. The vortices are generally created at a moving boundary due to frictionless conditions. Vortices move with the fluid and dispersed by the action of viscosity.
Superfluid helium-4 is the most studied example of superfluidity. It changes from a liquid to a superfluids just a few degree below its boiling point of $-452^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ $\left(-289^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right.$ or 4 K$)$. Superfluids helium-4 moving as a normal clear liquid, but it has no viscosity. This means that once it starts to flow, it keeps moving past

## TIGBR

Perachutes increase air resistance (drag) by creating a large surface area, which counteracts the force of gravity. This slows down the persons fall, allowing them to land safely. any obstacles.

## Superfluidity Applications

Currently, there are few practical uses for superfluids. Superfluid helium-4 serves as a coolant for high-field magnets. Both helium-3 and helium-4 are utilized in advanced particle detectors. Researching superfluidity also helps us learn more about superconductivity.
Liquid helium is recognized for its great thermal conductivity and is used in cryogenic applications, including cooling superconducting magnets, scientific research, and medical uses. Additionally, it is employed in industry for leak testing and in the production of electronic and optical products.
