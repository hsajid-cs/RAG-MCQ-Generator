### 5.11 BERNOULLI'S EQUATION

The sum of pressure, K.E. per unit volume and P.E. per unit volume of an ideal fluid throughoutits steady flowremains constant.

As the fluid moves through a pipe of varying crosssection and height, the pressure will change along the pipe. Bernoulli's equation is the fundamental equation in fluid dynamics that relates pressure to fluid speed and height.
Fig. 5.16: The speed of water spraying from the end of a garden hose increases as the hose is squeezed with the thumb.

In deriving Bernoulli's equation, we assume that the fluid is incompressible, non-viscous and flows in a steady state manner. Let us consider the flow of the fluid through the pipe in time $t$, as shown in Fig. 5.17.
The force on the upper end of the fluid is $P_{1} A_{1}$ where $P_{1}$ is the pressure and $A_{1}$ is the area of cross-section at the upper end. The work done on the fluid, by the fluid behind it, in moving it through a distance $\Delta x_{1}$, will be:

$$
W_{1}=F_{1} \Delta x_{1}=P_{1} A_{1} \Delta x_{1}
$$

Similarly, the work done on the fluid at the lower end is:

$$
W_{2}=-F_{2} \Delta x_{2}=-P_{2} A_{2} \Delta x_{2}
$$

Fig. 5.17: An ideal flow of fluid through a non-uniform cross-section pip at different heights.
where $P_{2}$ is the pressure, $A_{2}$ is the area of cross-section of lower end and $\Delta x_{2}$ is the distance moved by the fluid in same time interval $t$. The work $W_{2}$ is taken to be -ve as this work is done against the fluid force. The net work done will be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& W=W_{1}+W_{2} \\
& W=P_{1} A_{1} \Delta x_{1}-P_{2} A_{2} \Delta x_{2} \\
& \text { or } \\
& W_{1} A_{1} v_{1} t-P_{2} A_{2} v_{1} t
\end{aligned}
$$

From equation of continuity;

Hence

$$
A_{1} v_{1}=A_{1} v_{2}
$$

$$
A_{1} v_{1} t=A_{2} v_{2} t=V \text { (volume) }
$$

So

$$
W=\left(P_{1}-P_{2}\right) V
$$

If $m$ is the mass and $p$ is the density, then $V=\frac{m}{p}$. So, Eq. (5.18) becomes:

$$
W=\left(P_{1}-P_{2}\right) \frac{m}{p}
$$

A part of this work is utilized by the fluid in changing its $K . E$. and a part is used in changing its gravitational P.E.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Change in } K . E .=\Delta K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{1}^{2} \\
& \text { Change in } P . E .=\Delta P . E=m g h_{2}-m g h_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ are the heights of the upper and lower ends respectively.
Applying the law of conservation of energy to this volume of the fluid, we have

$$
\left(P_{1}-P_{2}\right) \frac{m}{\rho}=\frac{1}{2} m v_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{1}^{2}+m g h_{2}-m g h_{1} \ldots \ldots(5.22)
$$

Rearranging Eq. (5.22), we have

$$
P_{1}+\frac{1}{2} \rho v_{1}^{2}+\rho g h_{1}=P_{2}+\frac{1}{2} \rho v_{2}^{2}+\rho g h_{2}
$$

This is Bernoulli's equation and is often expressed as:

$$
P+\frac{1}{2} \rho v^{2}+\rho g h=\text { constant }
$$

# 5.12 USES OF BERNOULLI'S EQUATION

A number of devices operate by means of pressure difference that results from changes in the speed of the fluid.

## 1. Aeroplane Wings

Uplifting of an aeroplane is due to the designing of Its wings, which deflect the air so that streamlines are closer together above the wing than below it as illustrated in Fig.5.18. We have seen that where the streamlines are forced closer together, the speed is faster. Thus, air is travelling faster on the upper side of the wing than
Fig. 5.18: Lift of an acroplano
on the lower. The pressure will be lower at the top of the wing, and the wing will be forced upward and the lift of an aeroplane is due to this effect.

## 2. Swing of a Ball

When a ball is thrown or kicked with spin or the ball is made smoother on one side by the bowler and remains rough on the other side, the air moves faster over rough side and slows over the smoother (Fig. 5.19). According to Bernoulli's equation, the faster moving air creates lower pressure, while the slower moving air creates higher pressure, this pressure difference generates a sideways force, known as Magnus effect which causes the ball to curves in the air.

## 3. Filter Pump

Fig. 5.19: Turbulent flow

A filter pump has a constriction in the centre, so that a jet of water from the tap flows faster here. This causes a drop in pressure near it and air, therefore, flows in from the side tube. The air and water together are expelled through the lower part of the pump (Fig. 5.20).

# 4. Carburetor

The carburetor of a car engine uses a Venturi duct to feed the correct mixture of air and petrol to the cylinders. Air is drawn through the duct and along a pipe to the cylinders (Fig. 5.21). Atiny inlet at the side of duct is fed with petrol.
The air through the duct moves very fast, creating low pressure in the duct, which draws petrol vapours into the air stream.

## 5. Paint Sprayer

A stream of air passing over a tube dipped in a liquid will cause the liquid to rise in the tube as shown in Fig. 5.22. This effect is used in perfume bottles and paint sprayers. Actually when the rubber ball of atomizer is squeezed, the air is blown through tube and it rushes out through the narrow aperture with high speed and it causes fall of pressure. So, the atmospheric pressure puanes the perfume up leading to the narrow aperture.

## 6. Venturi Relation

Consider a pipe within which a fluid of density $p$ is flowing through different areas of cross-section as shown in the Fig. 5.23.
Let $A_{1}$ be the cross-sectional area at wide end and $A_{2}$ be the cross-sectional area at narrow portion.
Suppose that $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ be the flow speeds at the wide and narrow portions respectively. Pressure $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ indicate the liquid pressure at both the portions by connecting the limbs of the
Fig. 5.23: Venturi meter
manometer.

As the pipe is placed horizontally, therefore, we consider that average potential energy is the same at both places while using Bernoulli's equation.
Thus, Bernoulli's equation can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P_{1}+\frac{1}{2} p v_{1}^{2}=P_{2}-\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2} \\
& \text { or } \quad P_{1}-P_{2}=\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} p v_{1}^{2} \\
& \text { or } \quad P_{1}-P_{2}=\frac{1}{2} p\left(v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

From the equation of continuity:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_{1} v_{1} & =A_{2} v_{2} \\
v_{1} & =\frac{A_{2} v_{2}}{A_{1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 5. Solids and Fluid Dynamics

## 1. It is clear from the result of Bernoulli's Equation for horizontal pipe that "where speed is high, the pressure will be low". Mathematicallily,

$$
P+\frac{1}{2} p v^{2}=\text { constant }
$$

or

$$
v_{1}=\frac{A_{2} v_{2}}{A_{1}}
$$

As the cross-sectional area $A_{2}$ is small as compared to the area $A_{1}$ as is clear from the figure, i.e. $A_{2}<A_{1}$. So, $v_{1}$ will be small as compared to $v_{2}$. Thus, the speed of the fluid is very slow in wider portion of the pipe as compared to the narrow portion, So, we can neglect $v_{1}$ on the right-hand side of Eq.(5.23). Hence

$$
P_{1}-P_{2}=\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2}
$$

This is known as Venturi relation, which is used in venturi meter, a device used to measure speed of liquid flow.

## 7. Torricelli's Theorem

A simple application of Bernoulli's equation is shown in Fig. 5.24. Suppose a large tank of fluid has two small orifices $A$ and $B$ on it. Let us find the speed with which the water flows from the orifice $A$.
Since the orifices are so small, the efflux speeds $v_{2}$ and $v_{2}$ will be much larger than the speed $v_{1}$ of the top surface of water. We can therefore, take $v_{1}$ as approximately zero. Hence, Bernoulli's equation can be written as:

$$
P_{1}+p g h_{1}=P_{2}+\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2}+p g h_{2}
$$

But

$$
P_{1}=P_{2}=\text { Atmospheric pressure }
$$

Fig.5.24:
A tank containing fluid with a orifice.

Therefore, the above equation becomes:

$$
v_{2}=\sqrt{2 g\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)}
$$

This is Torricelli's theorem which states that:
The speed of efflux is equal to the velocity gained by the fluid in falling through the distance $\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)$ under the action of gravity.

Notice that the speed of the efflux of liquid is the same as the speed of a ball that falls through a height $\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)$. The top level of the tank has moved down a little and the P.E. has been transferred into $K . E$. of the efflux of fluid. If the orifice had been pointed upward at $B$ as shown in Fig.6.4, this $K . E$. would allow the liquid to rise to the level of water tank. In practice, viscous-energy losses would alter the result to some extent.

# 5.13 VISCOUS DRAG AND STOKES' LAW

The frictional effect between different layers of a flowing fluid is described in terms of viscosity of the fluid. Viscosity measures, how much force is required to slide one layer of the liquid over another layer. Substances that do not flow easily, such as thick tar and honey, etc., have large coefficients of viscosity, usually denoted by Greek letter ' $\eta$ '. Substances which flow easily, like water, have small coefficient of viscosities. Since liquids and gases have non zero viscosity, therefore, a force is required if an object is to be moved through them. Even the small viscosity of the air causes a large retarding force on a car as it travels at high speed. If you stick out your hand out of the window of a fast moving car, you can easily recognize that considerable force has to be exerted on your hand to move it through the air. These are typical examples of the following fact.

An object moving through a fluid experiences a retarding force called a drag force. The drag force increases as the speed of the object increases.
Even in the simplesl cases, the exact value of the drag force is difficult to calculate. However, the case of a sphere moving through a fluid is of great importance.
The drag force $F$ on a sphere of radius $r$ moving slowly with speed $v$ through a fluid of viscosity $\eta$ is given by Stokes' law as under:

$$
F=6 \pi \pi r v
$$

However, at high speeds the force is no longer simply proportional to speed.
