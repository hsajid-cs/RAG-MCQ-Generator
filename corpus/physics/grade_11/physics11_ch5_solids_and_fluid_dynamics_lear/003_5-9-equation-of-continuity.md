### 5.9 EQUATION OF CONTINUITY

## Statement

The product of cross-sectional area of the pipe and the fluid speed (i.e., $A v$ ) at any point along the pipe is a constant. This constant is equal to the volume flow per second of the fluid or simply the flow rate.

Thus

$$
A v=\text { Constant }=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Time }}
$$

Consider a fluid flowing through a pipe of non-uniform size.

Fig. 5.15: Steady flow of a fluid

The particles in the fluid move along the same lines in a steady state flow as shown in Fig 5.15.
If we consider the flow for a short interval of time $\Delta t$, the fluid at the lower end of the tube covers a distance $\Delta x$, with a velocity $v_{1}$, then distance covered by the fluid is:

$$
\Delta x_{1}=v_{1} \Delta t
$$

Let $A_{1}$ be the area of cross-section of the lower end, then volume of the fluid that flows into the tube at $A_{1}$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V=A_{1} \Delta x_{1} \\
& \text { or } \quad V=A_{1} v_{1} \Delta t
\end{aligned}
$$

## Scientific Fact

Euler obtained the continuity equation for a incompressible fluid with a large number of terms in 1752. Later, it was translated by C. Truesdell from Englisin in 1954.

If $\rho_{1}$ is the density of the fluid, then the mass of the fluid contained in the shaded region (through $A_{1}$ ) is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta m_{1}=\text { Volume } \times \text { Density } \\
& \text { or } \quad \Delta m_{1}=A_{1} v_{1} \Delta t \times \rho_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, the mass of the fluid that moves with velocity $v_{2}$ through the upper end of the pipe having cross-sectional area $A_{2}$ in the same time $\Delta t$ is given by

$$
\Delta m_{2}=A_{2} v_{2} \Delta t \times \rho_{2}
$$

where $\rho_{2}$ is the density of the fluid flowing out through $A_{2}$ and $\Delta m_{2}$ indicates small mass. If the fluid is incompressible and the flow is steady, the mass of the fluid is conserved. That is the mass flowing into the bottom of the pipe through $A_{1}$ in a time $\Delta t$ must be equal to the fluid flowing out though $A_{2}$ in the same time. Therefore,

$$
\Delta m_{1}=\Delta m_{2}
$$

So

$$
A_{1} v_{1} \Delta t \times \rho_{1}=A_{2} v_{2} \Delta t \times \rho_{2}
$$

or

$$
A_{1} v_{2} \rho_{1}=A_{2} v_{2} \rho_{2}
$$

Equation (5.15) is called the equation of continuity. Since density is constant for the steady flow of incompressible fluid, therefore, the equation of continuity becomes:

$$
A_{1} v_{1}=A_{2} v_{2}
$$

Equation (5.16) states that in steady flow, the rate of flow of the fluid inward is equal to the rate of flow of the fluid outward.
This equation justifies the conservation of mass of the fluid which is flowing through a pipe.

A water hose with an internal diameter of 20 mm at the outlet discharge 30 kg of water in 60 s . Calculate the water speed at the outlet. Assume the density of water is $1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ and its flow is steady.

Internal diameter of water hose $D=20 \mathrm{~mm}=0.02 \mathrm{~m}$
Solution Radius

$$
r=\frac{D}{2}=\frac{0.02 \mathrm{~m}}{2}=0.01 \mathrm{~m}
$$

| Physica III |  | (0) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Mass of water | $m=30 \mathrm{~kg}$ |  |
| Time taken | $t=60 \mathrm{~s}$ |  |
| Density of water | $\rho=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ |  |
| Speed of water | $v=$ ? |  |
| Mass flow per second $m / t$ |  | $=30 \mathrm{~kg} / 60 \mathrm{~s}$ |
|  |  | $=0.5 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ |
| Cross-sectional area | $A=$ | $\pi r^{2}$ |
|  |  | $=3.14 \times(0.01 \mathrm{~m})^{2}$ |
|  |  | $=3.14 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ |

From equation of continuity, the mass of water discharging per second through area $A$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho A v & =\text { Mass } / \text { Second } \\
v & =\frac{\text { Mass } / \text { Second }}{\rho A} \\
v & =\frac{0.5 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{3} \times 3.14 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^{2}} \\
& =1.6 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

As the water falls, its speed increases and so, is cross sectional area decreases as mandated by the continuity equation.

## The equation of continuity is applied to:
(i) blood flow in arteries and veins
(ii) water flow in rivers and pipes
(iii) air flow in duct and ventilation systems.

# 5.10 INCREASEIN FLOWVELOCITY

We can increase the flow velocity of water in a rubber pipe by squeezing it. When we squeeze the rubber pipe, we decrease the cross-sectional area through which the water flows. According to the equation of continuity,

$$
A_{1} v_{1}=A_{2} v_{2}
$$

where $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $v$ is the flow velocity. By decreasing the crosssectional area $\left(A_{2}<A_{1}\right)$, the velocity of the water $\left(v_{2}\right)$ must increase to maintain the same flow rate. Therefore, squeezing the rubber pipe increases the flow velocity of fluid.
