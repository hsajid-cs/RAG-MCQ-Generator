### 5.6 STRAIN ENERGY IN DEFORMED MATERIALS

When a body is deformed by a force, work is done against elastic restoring force. It is stored in it as its potential energy and is equal to the gain in potential energy of the molecules of a body due to the displacement of these molecules from their mean positions.

## Derivation of Expression for Energy Stored in a Stretched Material

Consider a material in the form of a spring as shown in Fig. 5.6. It is stretched by a

force $F$ through extension $x$. As the extension is directly proportional to the stretching force within the elastic limit, therefore the force increases uniformly from zero to $F$ as shown in Fig. 5.7. Thus, the average force that stretches the spring through $x$ is $1 / 2 F$. Hence work done by the stretching force will be given as:
Work done $=$ Average force $\times$ Distance in the direction of the force

$$
W=\frac{1}{2} F \times x
$$

From Hooke's law

$$
F=k(x)
$$

Therefore,

$$
W=\left(\frac{1}{2} k x\right) \cdot(x)=\frac{1}{2} k x^{2}
$$

or

$$
W=\text { Area of } O P Q
$$

The work done by the stretching force is stored in the spring as its strained energy and is equal to the potential energy stored in its molecules.
Strained energy stored in the body $E=\frac{1}{2} F \cdot x=\frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$
For your intonstion
The amount of work done in stretching a material is equal to the average force applied multiplied by the distance moved.
Therefore, the area under a force-extension graph represents the work done to stretch the material, Work done to stretch the material is also equal to elastic $P E$. stored in the material.

# 5.7 ARCHIMEDES' PRINCIPLE AND FLOATATION

An air-filled balloon immediately shoots up to the surface when released under the surface of water. The same would happen if a piece of wood is released under water. We might have noticed that a mug filled with water feels light under water but feels heavy as soon as we take it out of water.
More than two thousand years ago, the Greek scientist, Archimedes noticed that there is an upward force which acts on an object which is kept inside a liquid. As a result, an apparent reduction in weight of the object is observed. This upward force acting on the object is called the upthrust of the liquid. Archimedes' principle states that:

When an object is totally or partially immersed in a liquid, an upthrust acts on it equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.
Consider a solid cylinder of cross-sectional area $A$ and height $h$ immersed in a liquid as shown in Fig. 5.8. Let $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ be the depths of the top and bottom faces of the cylinder respectively from the surface of the liquid. Then

$$
h_{2}-h_{1}=h
$$

If $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are the liquid pressures at depths $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ respectively and $\rho$ is its density, then using equation $P=\rho g h$ of liquid pressure at height $h$ :

$$
P_{1}=\rho g h_{1}
$$

and $\quad P_{2}=\rho g h_{2}$
Let the force $F_{1}$ be exerted at the top of cylinder by the liquid due to pressure $P_{2}$ and the force $F_{2}$ be exerted at the bottom of the cylinder by the liquid due to $P_{2}$. Then $F_{1}=P_{1} A=\rho g h_{1} A$
and $\quad F_{2}=P_{2} A=\rho g h_{2} A$
Fig. 5.8. Upthrust on a body immersed in a liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced.
$F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ are the forces acting on the opposite faces of the cylinder. Therefore, the net force $F$ will be equal to the difference of these forces. This net force $F$ on the cylinder is called the upthrust of the liquid. Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{2}-F_{1} & =\rho g h_{1} A-\rho g h_{1} A \\
& =\rho g A\left(h_{2}-h_{1}\right) \ldots \ldots(5.10)
\end{aligned}
$$

or Upthrust of liquid $=\rho g A h$

$$
\text { Upthrust }=\rho g V
$$

Here $A h$ is the volume $V$ of the cylinder and is equal to the volume of the liquid displaced by the cylinder, therefore, $\rho g V$ is the weight of the liquid displaced. This equation shows that an upthrust acts on a body immersed in a liquid and is equal to the weight of liquid displaced, which is Archimede's principle.

Example 5.2 A wooden cube of sides 10 cm each has been dipped completely in water. Calculate the upthurst of water acting on it.

# Solution

Given

| Length of side | $L=10 \mathrm{~cm}=0.1 \mathrm{~m}$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| Volume | $V=L^{2}=(0.1 \mathrm{~m})^{2}=1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ |
| Density of water | $\rho=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ |
| Upthrust | $F=$ ? |

Using Archimede's principle
Upthrust of water

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\rho g V \\
& =1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2} \times 1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{3}=9.8 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Brain teaser

Why does a ship made of heavy steel float on water, while a small rock sink?

Thus, upthrust of water acting on the wooden cube is 9.8 N .

# Floatation

An object sinks into a fluid if its weight is greater than the upthrust acting on it. However, an object floats if its weight is equal or less than the upthrust. When an object floats in a fluid, the upthrust acting on it is equal to the weight of the object. In case of floating object, the object may be partially immersed. The upthrust is always equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This is the principle of floatation. It states that:

A floating object displaces a fluid having weight equal to the weight of the object.
Archimedes' principle is applicable on liquids as well as on gases. We find numerous applications of this principle in our daily life.

## Applications

Following are some important applications of Archimedes' principle.

## 1. Hot-air balloon

The reason why hot-air balloons (Fig. 5.9) rise and float in mid-air is because of the density of the hot-air balloon is less than the surrounding air. When the upthrust of the surrounded air is more, it starts to rise. This is done by varying the quantity of hot air in the balloon.
Fig. 5.9

## 2. Wooden block floating on water

A wooden block floats on water. It is because the weight of an equal volume of water is greater than the weight of the block. According to the principle of floatation, a body floats if its displaced water is equal to the weight of the body when it is partially or completely immersed in water.

## 3. Ships and boats

Ships and boats are designed on the same principle of floatation. They carry passengers and goods over water. It would sink in water if its total weight becomes greater than the upthrust of water.

## 4. Submarine

A submarine can travel over as well as under water using the same principle of floatation.
It floats over water when the weight of water equal to its volume is greater than its weight. Under this condition, it is similar to a ship and remains partially above water level. It has a system of tanks which can be filled with and emptied from seawater. When these tanks are

# Physics II

filled with seawater, the weight of the submarine increases. As soon as its weight becomes greater than the upthrust, it dives into water and remains under water. To come up on the surface, the tanks are made empty from seawater.
Example 5.3 An empty meteorological balloon weighs 80 N . It is filled with 10 cubic metres of hydrogen. How much maximum contents the balloon can lift besides its own weight? The density of hydrogen is $0.09 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ and the density of air is $1.3 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$.

## Solution Given:

Weight of the balloon $w=80 \mathrm{~N}$
Volume of hydrogen $V=10 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
Density of hydrogen $\rho_{1}=0.09 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
Density of air $\rho_{2}=1.3 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$
Weight of hydrogen $w_{1}=$ ?
Weight of the contents $w_{2}=$ ?
Upthrust $F=$ Weight of air displaced
$=\rho_{1} g V$
$=1.3 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2} \times 10 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
$=127.4 \mathrm{~N}$
Weight of hydrogen $w_{1}=\rho_{1} \mathrm{Vg}$
$=0.09 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \times 10 \mathrm{~m}^{3} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$
Total weight lifted $F=w+w_{2}+w_{0}$
To lift the contents, the total weight of the balloon should not exceed $F$.
Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
w+w_{1}+w_{2} & =F \\
80 \mathrm{~N}+8.82 \mathrm{~N}+w_{2} & =127.4 \mathrm{~N} \\
w_{0} & =38.58 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the maximum weight of 38.58 N can be lifted by the balloon in addition to its own weight.
