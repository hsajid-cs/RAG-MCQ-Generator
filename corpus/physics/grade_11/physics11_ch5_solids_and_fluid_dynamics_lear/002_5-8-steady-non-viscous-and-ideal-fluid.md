### 5.8 STEADY, NON-VISCOUS AND IDEAL FLUID

Moving fluids have great importance. In order to find the behaviour of the fluid in motion, we consider their flow through the pipes. When a fluid is in motion, its flow can take place in two ways, either streamline or turbulent.

## Streamline or Laminar Flow

The flow is said to be streamline or laminar flow.

If every particle that passes a particular point, moves along exactly the same path, as followed by particles which passed that points earlier.

In a steady flow of a fluid, the motion of the particles is smooth and regular, as shown in Fig. 5.11. The smooth path followed by fluid particles in laminar flow is called a streamline. The streamline may be the straight or curved and tangent to any point gives the direction of flow of a fluid. The different

streamlines cannot cross each other.
Example: A fluid flowing in a pipe as shown in Fig. 5.12 will have certain velocity $v_{1}$ at $P$, a velocity $v_{2}$ at $Q$ and so on. If the velocity of a particle of the fluid at $P, Q$ and $R$ does not change with the passage of time, then the flow is said to be steady flow or streamline flow.

The line PQR which represents the path followed by the particle is called a streamline. It represents the fixed path followed by orderly processing particles. In streamline flow, all the particles passing through $P$ also pass through $Q$ and $R$. It means that two streamlines cannot cross each other.

# Turbulent Flow

The irregular or unsteady flow of the fluid is called turbulent flow.
Fig. 5.13: Turbulent flow

Above a certain velocity of the fluid flow, the motion of the fluid becomes unsteady and irregular. Under this condition, the velocity of the fluid changes abruptly as shown in the Fig. 5.13. In this case, the exact path of the particles cannot be considered.
If two streamlines cross each other, then the particles will go in one or in the other directions and flow will not be a steady flow. Such a flow is a turbulent flow. When the flow is unsteady or turbulent, there are eddies and whirlpools in the motion and the paths of the particles are continuously changing.

## Ideal Fluid

The behaviour of the fluid which satisfies the following conditions is called Ideal fluid:

1. The fluid is non-viscous i.e., there is no frictional force between adjacent layers of the fluid.
Formula One racing cars have a streamlined design.
Dolphins have streamlined bodies to assist their movement in water.

2. The fluid is incompressible i.e., its density is constant.
3. The fluid motion is steady.

# Rate of Flow

The rate of flow of a fluid through a pipe is the volume of the fluid passing through any section of pipe per unit time.

## Formula For Rate of Flow

Consider a fluid flowing through a pipe of area of cross-section $A$ as shown in Fig. 5.14. Let the velocity of the fluid be $v$ and it flows through the pipe for time $t$, then the distance covered by the fluid in time is:

$$
t=v t
$$

Fig. 5.14: Rate of flow of a liquid
where $t$ is the length of the pipe through which the fluid passes in time $t$. Volume of the fluid passing through the pipe in time $t$, is:

$$
A \times t=A v t
$$

Thus The rate of flow of the liquid $=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Time }}$

$$
=\frac{A v t}{t}=A v
$$

$$
\text { Rate of flow }=A v
$$

In SI units, it is measured in cubic metre per second ( $\mathrm{m}^{3} \mathrm{~s}^{1}$ ). Sometimes, it is also measured in litres per second ( $\mathrm{L} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ).

## Steady Flow

If the overall flow pattern does not change with time, the flow is called steady flow.
In steady flow, every particle of the fluid follows the same flow line as its previous particle.
