### 7.6 STATIONARY WAVES IN AIR COLUMNS

Stationary waves can be set up in other media also, such as air column inside a pipe or tube. A common example of vibrating air column is in the organ pipe.

# Organ pipe

An organ pipe is a wind instrument in which sound is produced, due to setting up of stationary waves in air column. It consists of a hollow long tube with both ends open or with one end open and the other closed. The relationship between the incident wave and the reflected wave depends upon whether the reflecting end of the pipe is open or closed.
(I) If the reflecting end is open, the air molecules have complete freedom of motion and this behaves as an antinode.
(ii) If the reflecting end is closed, then it behaves as a node because the movement of the molecules is restricted.

## Modes of Vibrations

Stationary longitudinal waves occur in a pipe as discussed by the following two cases:

## Case (1): Modes of vibrations in an organ pipe open at both ends

Let us consider an organ pipe of length $\ell$ which is open at both ends. As at the open end, an air molecule has complete freedom of motion so it acts as antinode as shown in Fig.7.8. In this figure, longitudinal waves set up inside the pipe have been represented by transverse curved lines which represent the displacement and amplitude of vibration of air particles at various points along the axis of pipe.

## (a) Fundamental mode of vibration

In this case, as shown in Fig. 7.8 (a), there is only one node N at the middle of the pipe. As both ends of pipe are open, there are two antinodes at both the ends. If $\lambda_{1}$ is the wavelength of sound, then
or

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=\frac{\lambda_{1}}{4} \frac{\lambda_{1}}{4} \\
& \ell=\frac{\lambda_{1}}{2} \\
& \text { or } \quad \lambda_{1}=2 \ell
\end{aligned}
$$

If $f_{1}$ is the frequency of sound, then the velocity of sound is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v=f_{1} \lambda_{1} \\
& f_{1}=v / \lambda_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the value of $\lambda_{1}$, we have
Fig. 7.8:
Stationary longitudinal waves in a pipe open at both ends.

$$
f_{1}=v / 2 \ell
$$

This frequency is called fundamental frequency or first harmonic.

## (b) Second mode of vibration

If there are three antinodes and two nodes, frequency will be twice that of fundamental

frequency. It is second mode of vibration as shown in Fig.7.8 (b). In this case, there are three antinodes and two nodes.
If $\lambda_{0}$ is the wavelength of sound, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=\frac{\lambda_{2}}{4}+\frac{\lambda_{2}}{2}+\frac{\lambda_{2}}{4} \\
& \ell=(1+2+1) \quad \frac{\lambda_{2}}{4} \\
& \text { or } \quad \lambda_{2}=\ell
\end{aligned}
$$

If $f_{2}$ is the frequency of sound, then speed $v$ of sound becomes:

$$
v=f_{2} \lambda_{2}
$$

or

$$
f_{2}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{2}}
$$

Putting the value of $\lambda_{2}$, we have

$$
f_{2}=\frac{v}{\ell}
$$

or

$$
f_{2}=2 f_{1} \quad\left(\because \frac{v}{2 \ell}=f_{1}\right)
$$

## (c) nth mode of vibration

Similarly, frequency for air column vibrating in $n$ loops is:

$$
f_{n}=n(v / 2 \ell)
$$

and wavelength is

$$
\lambda_{2}=\frac{2 \ell}{n}
$$

where

$$
n=1,2,3,4,5
$$

So, the longitudinal stationary waves have a discrete set of frequencies $f_{1}, 2 f_{1}, 3 f_{2}, \ldots, n f_{n}$, which is known as harmonic series. The frequency $f_{1}$ is known as fundamental frequency and the others are called harmonics.

## Case (2): Modes of vibration in an organ pipe closed at one end

Let us consider an organ pipe of length $\ell$ which is closed at one end. Then at the closed end, we get a node while at the open end, we get an antinode as shown in the Fig. 7.9.

## (a) Fundamental mode of vibration:

Fundamental mode of vibration has one node and one antinode as shown in Fig.7.9 (a). If $\lambda_{1}$ is the wavelength of fundamental mode, then length of the pipe is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=\frac{\lambda_{1}}{4} \\
& \lambda_{1}=4 \ell
\end{aligned}
$$

# Physics II

So, the speed $v$ becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v=f_{1} \lambda \\
& f_{1}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{1}} \\
& f_{1}=\frac{v}{4 \ell} \quad\left(\because \lambda_{1}=4 \ell\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

The frequency $f_{1}$ is called fundamental frequency.

## (b) Second Mode of Vibration:

Second mode of vibration contains two nodes and two anti-nodes as shown in Fig.7.9 (b).
If $\lambda_{2}$ is the wavelength, then length of the pipe is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=\frac{\lambda_{1}}{4}+\frac{\lambda_{2}}{2} \\
& \ell=\frac{3}{4} \lambda_{3} \\
& \lambda_{3}=\frac{4 \ell}{3} \\
& f_{3}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{3}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting value of $\lambda_{3}$, we have $v=f_{3} \lambda_{3}$
or

$$
f_{3}=\frac{v}{4 \ell}
$$

so

$$
f_{3}=3 f_{1} \quad\left[\because \frac{v}{4 \ell}=f_{1}\right]
$$

This is called second harmonic.

## (c) nth mode of vibration

If air column vibration in $n$ loops, then frequency $f_{n}$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{n}=n\left(\frac{v}{4 \ell}\right) \\
& f_{n}=n f_{1} \quad \text { where } n=1,3,6, \ldots
\end{aligned}
$$

and the wavelength $\lambda_{n}$ is:

$$
\lambda_{n}=\frac{4 \ell}{n}
$$

By studying both cases, we conclude that the pipe which is open at both ends is richer in harmonics than that of closed at one end.
In an organ pipe, the primary driving mechanism is wavering, sheet like jet of air from fluts-sit, which interacts with the upper lip and the air column in the pipe to maintain a steady oscillation.

Example 7.4 An organ pipe has a length of 50 cm . Find the frequency of its fundamentalnote and thenext harmonic, when it is:
(a) open at both ends
(b) closed at one end
(Speed of sound $=350 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ )
Solution $\quad t=50 \mathrm{~cm}=\frac{50}{100} \mathrm{~m}=0.5 \mathrm{~m}$

# Pander upent

a) When pipe is open at both ends:

Fundamental frequency $\quad f_{1}=$ ?
Nextharmonic frequency $\quad f_{2}=$ ?
The frequency for $n$th harmonia in an open organ pipels:

$$
f_{1}-n \frac{v}{2 t} \quad \text { when } n=1,2,3, \ldots \ldots
$$

so the fundamental frequency is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{1}=\frac{1 \times 350 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{2 \times 0.5 \mathrm{~m}} \quad \text { put } n=1 \\
& f_{1}=350 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

Next harmonic frequency i.e., $n=2$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{2}=\frac{2 v}{2 t} \\
& f_{2}=\frac{v}{t}=\frac{350 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{0.5 \mathrm{~m}}=700 \mathrm{~s} \\
& f_{2}=700 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

b) When pipe is closed at one end:

Fundamental frequency $\quad f_{1}=$ ?
Nextharmonio frequency $\quad f_{2}=$ ?
When the pipe is closed at one end, then frequency for nth harmonic is

$$
f_{n}-n \frac{v}{4 t} \quad \text { when } n=1,3,5,7 \ldots \ldots
$$

So fundamental frequency is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{1}=\frac{1 \times 350 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{4 \times 0.5 \mathrm{~m}} \quad \text { putting } n=1 \\
& f_{1}=175 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

Next harmonic frequency i.e., $n=3$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{3}=\frac{3 v}{4 \ell} \\
& f_{1}=\frac{3 \times 350 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{4 \times 0.5 \mathrm{~m}} \\
& f_{y}=525 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 7.5 A church organ consists of pipes, each open at one end, of different lengths. The minimum length is 30 mm and the longest is 4 m . Calculate the frequency range of the fundamental notes. (Speed of sound $=340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ )

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Solution } \quad \ell_{\text {min }}=30 \mathrm{~mm}=\frac{30}{1000} \mathrm{~m}=30 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} \\
& \ell_{\text {max }}=4 \mathrm{~m} \\
& v=340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Frequency range $=$ ?
For an organ pipe open at one end only:

$$
f_{n}=\frac{n v}{4 \ell}
$$

(i) Minimum length

For fundamental frequency, put $n=1$

$$
f_{1, \text { min }}=\frac{n v}{4 \ell_{\text {min }}}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{1, \text { max }}=\frac{1 \times 340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{4 \times 30 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}} \\
& f_{\text {max }}=2833.33 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) Maximum length:

For fundamental frequency, put $n=1$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{\text {tmin }}-\frac{n v}{4 \ell_{\text {max }}} \\
& f_{\text {min }}=\frac{1 \times 340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{4 \times 4 \mathrm{~m}} \\
& f_{\text {min }}=21.25 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

So, the fundamental frequency range is approximately from 21 Hz to 2833 Hz .

# 7.7 EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATING STATIONARY WAVES USING MICROWAVES

Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiations. They are called "micro" waves because their wavelengths are typically of the order of millimetres or centimetres, much shorter than radiowaves. Stationary waves, also known as standing waves, can be produced by microwaves when they are confined to a specific region or cavity such as wave guides or resonant chambers. In these structures, microwaves can bounce back and forth, creating a standing wave pattern with nodes and antinodes. It occurs when the microwave frequency matches the resonant frequency of the cavity.
The stationary waves can be created using microwaves by the following simple method as shown in Fig. 7.10.
Fig. 7.10: Experimental setup for stationary waves using microwave
The experiment setup consists of a microwave source (transmitter), a probe detector and a metal reflector (a metallic plate for the reflection of microwave). Three of the mentioned are placed in line.
The waves coming out of microwave source are moving towards the metal plate and then reflected back. The reflected wave and incident wave superpose and create a stationary wave pattern. This can be detected by a probe detector placed between transmitter and metallic plate. The intensity of the signal can be observed by the detector. You can move the plate or detector to observe antinode and node. By finding the distance from one antinode to the next antinode, the wavelength of stationary wave can be found.

# 7.8 DIFFRACTION OF WAVES

Diffraction of waves is the bending of waves around the sharp edges or comers of obstacles or the spreading of waves beyond a barrier. It occurs when a wave encounters a physical barrier or an opening (a slit) that is comparable in size to the wavelength of the wave. The longer the wavelength, the greater the spreading and vice versa.
Diffraction can be observed in various types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, light waves and electromagnetic waves.
Some examples of the phenomenon of diffraction include:

- Hearing of sound waves around comers or through door way from where they were generated as sound waves bend around the comers.
- Diffraction of X-rays by crystals as the spacing between the regular arrays of atoms is of the order of X-rays wavelength.
Diffraction is a fundamental aspect of wave behaviour and has many practical applications in various fields.

## The Ripple Tank

Figure 7.11 shows a ripple tank. It is a very useful apparatus not only to generate water waves, but also to demonstrate wave properties (such as reflection, diffraction and refraction).
Fig. 7.11: A ripple tank
Ripple tank contains water, vibrator (e.g. a motorized oscillating needle), obstacles (e.g. a small rectangular block or a semicircular barrier) and gap widths of different sizes. It creates a series of concentric circles
Small gap, increased diffraction Large gap, Decreased diffraction

or parallel waves using the vibrator. An obstacle is placed for creating a gap with a specific width. The experiment can be repeated with differentgap widths. It is observed that when the gap width is small compared to the wavelength, diffraction is significant and the waves bend around the obstacle, creating a semicircular pattern. As the gap width increases relative to wavelength, diffraction decreases and the waves pass through the gap with less bending.
This experiment demonstrates the qualitative effect of gap width on diffraction in a ripple tank, illustrating how the relationship between gap width and wavelength affects wave behaviour.

# Example 7.6

In a ripple tank, a wave generator produces 500 pulses in 10 s . Find the frequency at time period of the pulses produced?
Solution $n-500$ pulses, $t=10 \mathrm{~s}, f=$ ?
As Frequency $=\frac{\text { Number of pulses }}{\text { Time }}$

$$
f=\frac{500}{10 \mathrm{~s}}=50 \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

We know that: $\quad T-\frac{1}{f}=0.02 \mathrm{~s}$
