### 7.3 INTERFERENCE AND ITS TYPES

Superposition of two waves having the same frequency and travelling in the same direction results in phenomenon called interference.

Fig. 7.5 (b): Interference of sound waves
An experimental setup to observe interference effect of sound waves is shown in Fig. 7.5(a). Two loud speakers $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ act as two sources of harmonic sound waves of a fixed frequency produced by an Audio Generator (AG). Since the two speakers are driven from the same generator, therefore, they vibrate in phase. Such sources of waves are called coherent sources. A microphone attached to a sensitive Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) acts as a detector of sound waves. The CRO is a device to display

the input signal into waveform on its screen. The microphone is placed at various points, turn by turn, in front of the loud speakers as shown in Fig.7.5(b).

# Constructive Interference

At points $P_{1}, P_{3}$ and $P_{2}$, we find that a compression meets a compression and a rarefaction meets a rarefaction. So, the displacement of two waves are added up at these points according to the principle of superposition and a large resultant displacement is seen on the CRO screen (Fig.7.5-c).
Fig. 7.5(c):
Constructive Interference: Large displacement is displayed on the CRO screen
Fig. 7.5(d):
Destructive Interference:
Zero displacement is displayed on the CRO screen

From Fig. 7.5 (b), we find that the path difference $\Delta S$ between the waves at the point $P_{1}$, is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta S=S_{2} P_{1}-S_{1} P_{1} \\
& \Delta S=4 \frac{1}{2} \lambda-3 \frac{1}{2} \lambda=\lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, at points $P_{3}$ and $P_{2}$, path difference is zero and $\lambda$, respectively. Here, $\lambda$ is the wavelength which is the distance between any two successive solid or dashed lines.

Whenever the path difference is an integral multiple of wavelength, the two waves are added up. This effect is called constructive interference.
Therefore, the path difference (condition) for constructive interference can be written as:

$$
\Delta S=n \lambda \quad \text { where } n=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \ldots \ldots
$$

## Destructive Interference

At points $P_{2}$ and $P_{4}$, a compression meets a rarefaction, so that they cancel each other's effect according to the principle of superposition. The resultant displacement becomes zero, as shown in Fig. 7.5(d).
The path difference $\Delta S$ between the waves at points $P_{3}$ and $P_{4}$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta S=S_{2} P_{2}-S_{1} P_{2} \\
& \Delta S=4 \lambda-3 \frac{1}{2} \lambda=\frac{1}{2} \lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, at $P$, the path difference is $\frac{1}{2} \lambda$.
So, at points where the displacements of two waves cancel each other's effect, the path difference is an odd integral multiple of half the wavelength. This effect is called destructive interference.
Therefore, the path difference (condition) for destructive interference can be written as:

$$
\Delta S=(2 n+1) \lambda / 2 \quad \text { where } n=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3
$$

Example 7.1 Two speakers are arranged as shown in the figure. The distance between them is 3.0 m and they emit a constant tone of 344 Hz . A microphone $P$ is moved along a line parallel to and 4.0 m from the line connecting the two speakers. It is found that tone of maximum loudness is heard and displayed on the CRO when microphone is on the centre of the line and directly opposite to each speaker. Calculate the speed of sound.
Solution
Distance between speakers $S_{1} S_{2}$
Tone frequency $f$
Distance between speakers and line of motion of $P S_{2} P=4.0 \mathrm{~m}$
Speed of sound
For tone of maximum loudness or the condition for constructive interference, the path difference must be $0, \pm 1 \lambda, \pm 2 \lambda, \pm 3 \lambda, \ldots$
At middle point ' $O$ ' the path difference between two sound waves is zero ( $S_{1} O=S_{2} O$ ), thus at that point ' $O$ ' constructive interference takes place.
For the next point $P$ of constructive interference, the path difference between waves should be $\lambda . S_{2} P_{1} \quad \lambda=$ Path difference $=S_{2} P_{1}-S_{1} P_{1}$
Now, we calculate values of $S_{2} P_{1}$ from right angle triangle $S_{1} S_{2} P_{1}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S_{2} P_{1}=\sqrt{\left(S_{1} S_{2}\right)^{2}+\left(S_{1} P_{1}\right)^{2}} \quad \text { (By PythagorasTheorem) } \\
& S_{2} P_{1}=\sqrt{(3 m)^{2}+(4 m)^{2}}=\sqrt{(9+16)} m=\sqrt{25} \mathrm{~m}=5 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore

$$
\lambda=S_{2} P_{1}-S_{1} P_{1} \quad \text { or } \quad \lambda=5 m-4 m=1 m
$$

This is the path difference for constructive interference.
As

$$
v=f \lambda
$$

Putting the values, we have

$$
v=344 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \times 1 \mathrm{~m}=344 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

# Physica II

Example 7.2 The wavelength of a signal from a radio transmitter is 1500 m and the frequency is 200 kHz . What is the wavelength for a transmitter operating at 1000 kHz and with what speed the radiowaves travel?

## Solution

$\lambda_{1}=1500 \mathrm{~m}=1.5 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~m}, \quad f_{1}=200 \mathrm{kHz}=2.0 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~Hz}$ $f_{2}=1000 \mathrm{kHz}=1 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~Hz}, \lambda_{2}=?, v=?, \mathrm{As} v=f \lambda$ Since, the speed of both the signals is same, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v=f_{1} \lambda_{1} \\
& v=2.0 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~Hz} \times 1500 \mathrm{~m} \\
& v=3.0 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\
& v=f_{2} \lambda_{2} \\
& \lambda_{2}-\frac{v}{f_{2}} \\
& \lambda_{2}=\frac{3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{1 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~Hz}} \\
& \lambda_{2}=3 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 7.4 STATIONARY WAVES \& THEIR FORMATION

Stationary waves, also known as standing waves, are the waves that oscillate in a fixed position, without moving or propagating. They are formed by the superposition of two waves with the same frequency and amplitude, travelling in opposite directions. The resulting wave pattern remains stationary, with nodes (points of zero amplitude) and antinodes (points of maximum amplitude) at fixed positions. Examples include waves on a string, and sound waves in a pipe. The term "standing wave" describes that the wave pattern remains fixed in space, oscillating between positive and negative values, without moving forward or backward.
Let us consider the superposition of two waves moving along a string in opposite directions. Figures 7.6 (a) and (b) show the profile of two such waves at instants $t=0, T / 4, T / 2,3 / 4 T$ and $T$, where $T$ is the time period of the wave. We are interested in finding out the displacements of the points $1,2,3,4,5,6$ and 7 at these instants as the waves superpose. It is obvious that the points $1,2, . ., 7$ are distant $\lambda / 4$ apart, $\lambda$ being the wavelength of the waves. We can determine the resultant displacement of these points by applying the principle of superposition.
Figure 7.6 (c) shows the resultant displacement of the points 1,3,5 and 7 at the instants $t=0, T / 4, T / 2,3 T / 4$ and $T$. It can be seen that the resultant displacement of these points is always zero. These points of the medium are known as nodes. Here, the distance between two consecutive nodes is $\lambda / 2$.

Fig. 7.6: Stationary waves
Figure 7.6 (d) shows the resultant displacement of the points 2,4 and 6 at the instants $t=0,7 / 4,7 / 2,37 / 4$ and $T$. The figure shows that these points are moving with an amplitude which is the sum of the amplitudes of the component waves represented by arrows. These points are known as antinodes. They are situated midway between the nodes and are $1 / 2$ apart. The distance between a node and the next antinode is $1 / 4$. Such a pattern of nodes and antinodes is known as a stationary or standing wave.
Energy in a wave transfers because of the motion of the particles of the medium. The nodes always remain at rest, so energy cannot flow past these points. Hence, energy remains "standing" in the medium between nodes, although it alternates between potential and kinetic forms at the antinodes. When the antinodes are all at their extreme displacements, the energy stored is wholly potential and when they are simultaneously passing through their equilibrium positions, the energy is wholly kinetic.

# 7.5 STATIONARY WAVES ON A STRETCHED STRING

Consider a string of length $\ell$ which is kept stretched by clamping its ends so that the tension in the string is $F$.

## (a) String Plucked at its Middle Point

If the string is plucked at its middle point, two transverse waves will originate from this point. One of them will move towards the left end of the string and the other towards the right end. When these waves reach the two clamped ends, they are reflected back thus giving rise to stationary waves. As the two ends of the string are clamped, no motion will take place there. So, nodes will be formed at the two ends and one mode of vibration of the string will be as shown in Fig.7.7(a) with the two ends as nodes with one antinode in between. Visually, the string seems to vibrate in one loop. As the distance between two
Fig. 7.7(a): First mode of vibration

consecutive nodes is one half of the wavelength of the waves set up in the string, so in this mode of vibration, the length $\ell$ of the string is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=\lambda_{1} / 2 \\
& \lambda_{1}=2 \ell
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\lambda_{1}$ is the wavelength of the waves set up in this mode. The speed $v$ of the waves in the string depends upon the tension $F$ of the string and $m$, the mass per unit length of the string. It is independent of the point from where string is plucked to generate wave. It is given by

$$
v=\frac{F}{m}
$$

Knowing the speed $v$ and wavelength $\lambda_{1}$, the frequency $f_{1}$ of the waves is:

$$
f_{1}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{1}}=\frac{v}{2 \ell}
$$

Substituting the value of $v$,

$$
f_{1}=\frac{1}{2 \ell} \cdot \frac{F}{m}
$$

Thus, in the first mode of vibration shown in Fig. 7.7 (a), waves of frequency $f_{1}$ only will be set up in the given string.

# (b) String Plucked at Quarter Length

If the same string is plucked from one quarter of its length, again stationary waves will be set up with nodes and antinodes as shown in Fig. 7.7 (b). Note that now the string vibrates in two loops. This particular configuration of nodes and antinodes has developed because the string was plucked from the position of an antinode. As the distance between two consecutive nodes is half the wavelength, so the length $\ell$ of string is equal to the wavelength of the waves set up in this mode. If $\lambda_{2}$ is the measure of wavelength of these waves, then,
Comparison of Eq. (7.5) with Eq. (7.1) shows that the wavelength in this case is half of that in the first case. Equation (7.2) shows that the speed of the waves depends on tension and mass per unit length of the string, it is independent of the point where the string is plucked. So, speed $v$ remains the same in both cases.
If $f_{2}$ is frequency of vibration of string in its second mode, then

$$
f_{2}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{2}}
$$

| Physica II |  |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Since | $\lambda_{2}=$ | $\ell$ |  |  |
| Therefore | $f_{2}$ | $=$ | $\frac{v}{\ell}$ |  |
| Multiplying and dividing by 2 , we have |  |  |  |  |
|  | $f_{2}$ | $=$ | $\frac{2 v}{2 \ell}$ | Brain toaser |
| We know that: | $f_{1}$ | $=$ | $\frac{v}{2 \ell}$ | A guitar string is plucked at <br> to centre. What harmonis is <br> produced? |
| So | $f_{2}$ | $=$ | $2 f_{1}$ |  |

Thus, when the string vibrates in two loops, its frequency becomes double than when it vibrates in one loop.

# (c) String Plucked at an Arbitrary Point

Let the string resonates in $n$ number of loops with $(n+1)$ nodes and $n$ antinodes. Thus, we can say that if the string is made to vibrate in $n$ loops, the frequency of stationary waves set up on the string will be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{n}=n\left(\frac{v}{2 \ell}\right) \\
& f_{n}=n f_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

and the corresponding wavelength is: $\lambda_{n}=\frac{2 \ell}{n}$
where $n=1,2,3, \ldots$
It is clear that as the string vibrates in more than one loop, its frequency $f$ goes on increasing and the wavelength $\lambda$ gets correspondingly shorter. However, the product of the frequency fand wavelength $\lambda$ is always equal to $v$, the speed of waves.

The above discussion clearly establishes that;

1. The stationary waves have a discrete set of frequencies $f_{1}, 2 f_{1}, 3 f_{1}, \ldots, n f$, which is known as harmonic series. The lowest characteristic frequency of vibration is the fundamental frequency $f$, corresponds to the first harmonic. The frequency $f_{2}=2 f$, corresponds to the second harmonic and so on.
2. In other words, quantum jumps in frequency exist between the resonance frequencies. This phenomenon is known as the Quantization of frequencies. It means $f_{n}=n f_{1}$ where $n=1,2,3, \ldots$ (Integral multiples). The stationary waves can be set up on the string only with the frequencies of harmonic series determined by the tension, length and mass per unit length of the string. Waves which are not in harmonic series are quickly damped out.
3. The frequency of a string on a musical instrument can be changed either by varying the tension or by changing the length. For example, the tension in guitar and violin

strings is varied by tightening the pegs on the neck of the instrument. Once the instrument is tuned, the musicians vary the frequency by moving their fingers along the neck, thereby changing the length of the vibrating portion of the string.

# Harmonics

In the above example, the set of all the possible standing waves, having frequencies $f_{1}$, $2 f_{1}, 3 f_{1}, \ldots, n f_{1}$, are called harmonics of the system. The lowest or fundamental frequency of all the harmonics is called the fundamental or first harmonic. Subsequent frequencies are called as second harmonic, third harmonic, etc.

Example 7.3 A stationary wave is established in a string which is 120 cm long and fixed at both ends. The string vibrates in four segments; at a frequency of 120 Hz . Determine its wavelength and the fundamental frequency?

Solution

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=120 \mathrm{om}=\frac{120}{100} \mathrm{~m}=1.2 \mathrm{~m} \\
& n=4 \\
& f_{4}=120 \mathrm{~Hz} \\
& f_{1}=? \\
& \lambda=?
\end{aligned}
$$

(i) As the string vibrates in four segments and the distance between two consecutive nodes is $2 / 2$, so the wavelength of the string is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=n \frac{\lambda_{n}}{2} \\
& \lambda_{n}=\frac{2 \ell}{n} \\
& \lambda_{4}=\frac{2 \times 1.2 \mathrm{~m}}{4} \\
& \lambda_{4}=0.6 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) If string vibrates in $n$ loops, then frequency of stationary waves will be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{n}=n f_{1} \\
& f_{4}=4 f \\
& 120 \mathrm{~Hz}=4 f_{1} \\
& f_{1}-\frac{120 \mathrm{~Hz}}{4} \\
& f=30 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$
