### 7.10 INTENSITY (I) OF A WAVE

Intensity is defined as the amount of energy transmitted per unit area per unit time in the direction of propagation of progressive wave.
It is a measure of the power of a wave and is usually denoted by the symbol " $I$ ". It is measured in units of watts per square metre $\left(\mathrm{Wm}^{2}\right)$.
A progressive wave or travelling wave is one that travels through a medium in a consistent direction and transferring energy from one point to another. It is a wave that propagates or moves forward, as opposed to a stationary or standing wave. Examples of progressive waves include water waves, sound waves, light waves, etc.
By definition, the intensity of a wave is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& I=\frac{E}{A \times t} \\
& I-\frac{E_{t}}{A}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
I=\begin{array}{ll}
P \\
A
\end{array}\left(\because F_{f}=P\right)
$$

Here

$$
\begin{aligned}
& I=\text { Intensity of wave in }\left(\mathrm{W} \mathrm{m}^{2}\right) \\
& E=\text { Energy in joules (J) } \\
& t=\text { Time in seconds (s) } \\
& P=\text { Power in watts ( } \mathrm{W})
\end{aligned}
$$

We know that in mechanical waves, such as sound waves, water waves, or waves on a vibrating string, energy is stored as kinetic energy and potential energy of the medium's particles. How much energy is stored depends upon the displacement (amplitude) of the particles from the mean position. Therefore, the intensity I of waves is proportional to the square of the amplitude A, i.e.,

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
& I \propto A^{2} \\
\text { or } & I=k A^{2} \ldots \ldots(7.14)
\end{array}
$$

Here $k$ is the constant of proportionality and depends upon the physical properties of the wave and the medium.

# Example 7.8

(a) A wave has an intensity of $0.5 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ at a distance of 3.0 m from the source. What is the power of the wave?
(b) Two progressive waves have intensities of $0.5 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and $0.25 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Find total intensities of two waves.
Solution
(a)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 1=0.5 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
& r=3.0 \mathrm{~m} \\
& P=? \\
& \because I=\frac{P}{A} \\
& \because I=\frac{P}{4 \pi r^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the values, $0.5 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}=\frac{P}{4 \times 3.14(3.0 \mathrm{~m})^{2}}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P=0.51 \times 13.04 \\
& P=56.52 \mathrm{~W} \\
& I_{1}=0.5 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
& I_{2}=0.25 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 7.11 DOPPLER EFFECT

The apparent change in the frequency (or pitch) of waves due to the relative motion between the source and observer (listener) is called Doppler Effect.
This effect was first observed by John Doppler while he was observing the frequency of light emitted from a star. In some cases, the frequency of emitted light was found to be slightly different from that emitted from a similar source on the Earth. He found that the change of frequency of light depends upon motion of star relative to Earth.
This effect can be observed with sound waves also. For example, when an observer is standing on a railway platform, the pitch of whistle of an engine coming towards the platform appears to become higher to an observer standing on the platform. However, the pitch of whistle of an engine going away from the platform appears to become lower to an observer standing on the platform.
Consider a source of sound $S$ at rest which emits sound waves having wavelength $\lambda$. Let speed of the sound for a stationary observer (i.e., listener) is $v$ then the number of waves received by observer in one second i.e., frequency $f$ is:

$$
f=\frac{v}{\lambda}
$$

# Case 1: When source of sound moves towards the stationary observer

When the source moves towards the stationary observer $A$ with velocity $u_{x}$ then waves are compressed and their wavelength is decreased as shown in Fig. 7.14. In this case, the waves are compressed by an amount given as

$$
A \lambda=\frac{u_{x}}{f}
$$

The compression of the waves is due to the fact that same number of waves are contained in a shorter space depending upon the velocity of the source. The wavelength observed by the observer A is then,
or

$$
\lambda_{A}=\lambda-\Delta \lambda
$$

$$
\lambda_{A}=\frac{v}{f}-\frac{u_{x}}{f}
$$

$$
\lambda_{A}=\frac{v-u_{x}}{f}
$$

Here $\Delta \lambda$ is the decrease in wavelength in one second and is called Doppler shift.
Fig. 7.14
A source moving with velocity $u_{x}$ towards a stationary observer $A$ and away from stationary observer B respectively. Observer A hears an increased and observer B hears a decreased frequency.

Thus, the number of waves received by observer $A$ in one second (i.e., changed or apparent frequency) is

$$
f_{A}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{A}}
$$

Putting the value of $\lambda_{A}$, we have

As

$$
f_{A}=\left[\frac{v}{\left(v-u_{x}\right)_{f}}\right]
$$

$$
f_{A}=\left[\frac{v}{v-u_{x}}\right] f
$$

$$
\frac{v}{v-u_{x}}>1
$$

Therefore

$$
f_{A}>f
$$

Thus, the apparent frequency of sound heard by the observer increases which in turn will increase the pitch of sound.

## Case 2: When source of sound moves away from the stationary observer

When the source moves away from the stationary observer $B$ with velocity $u_{x}$, then waves are expanded and their wavelength is increased. In this case, the waves

# Phycles II

expanded by an amount:

$$
\lambda_{3}=\frac{u_{2}}{f}
$$

The expansion of the waves is due to the fact that same number of waves are now contained in a large distance. The wavelength observed by the observed $B$ is then,

$$
\lambda_{B}=\lambda+\Delta \lambda
$$

where $\Delta \lambda$ is the increase in wavelength in one second and is called Doppler shift.
Thus, the number of waves received by observer B in one second (i.e. changed or apparent frequency) is:

$$
f_{B}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{B}}
$$

Putting the value of $\lambda_{3}$, we have

As
Therefore

$$
f_{N}=\left[\frac{v}{\left(v+u_{2}\right)_{f}}\right]
$$

$$
f_{B}=\left[\frac{v}{\left(v+u_{2}\right)}\right] f
$$

$$
\frac{v}{v+u_{2}}<1
$$

Thus, the apparent frequency of sound heard by the observer decreases which in turn will decrease the pitch of sound.

Example 7.10 Two trucks $P$ and $Q$ travelling along a motorway in the same direction. The loading truck $P$ travels at a steady speed of $12 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, the other truck $Q$, travelling at a steady speed of $20 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, sound its horn to emit a steady note which P's driver estimate, has a frequency of 830 Hz . What frequency does Q's own driver hear?
(Speed of sound $=340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ )
Solution

$$
\begin{aligned}
& u_{s}=12 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
& u_{a}=20 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
& v=340 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
& f_{p}=830 \mathrm{~Hz} \\
& f_{c}=?
\end{aligned}
$$

Speed of $Q$ relative to $P=u_{s}=u_{Q}-u_{p}=20 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}-12 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}=8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad f=\left(\frac{v}{v-u_{s}}\right) f^{\prime} \\
& \therefore \quad f_{p}=\left(\frac{v}{v-u_{s}}\right) f_{Q}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the value, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 830 \mathrm{~Hz}=\left(\frac{340 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{340 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}-8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}\right) f_{Q} \\
& 830 \mathrm{~Hz}=\left(\frac{340 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{332 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}\right) f_{Q} \\
& \text { or } \quad f_{Q}=\left(\frac{830 \mathrm{~Hz} \times 332 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}\right) \\
& \quad f_{Q}=810: 47 \mathrm{~Hz}

Calculate the train speed 50 s after departure. How far from the station is the train after 50 s .
(Speed of sound $=340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ )

# Solution

# 7.12 APPLICATIONS OF DOPPLER EFFECT

Doppler effect is also applicable to electromagnetic waves. One of its important applications is the radar system, which uses radio waves to determine the elevation and speed of an aeroplane. RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging) is a device, which transmits and receives radio waves. If an aeroplane approaches towards the radar, then the wavelength of the wave reflected from aeroplane (a) would be shorter and if it moves away, then the wavelength would be larger as shown in Fig.7.15 (a) \& Fig.7.15 (b), respectively. Similarly, speed of satellites moving around the Earth can also be (b) determined by the same principle.
Fig. 7.15:
A frequency shift is used in a radar to detod the motion of an aeroplane.

SONAR is an acronym derived from "Sound Navigation And Ranging". It is the general name for sonic or ultrasonic underwater echo-ranging and echo-scunding system. Sonar is the name of a technique for detecting the presence of objects under water by acoustical echo. In Sonar, "Doppler detection" relies upon the relative speed of the target and the detector to provide an indication of the target speed. It employs the Doppler effect, in which an apparent change in frequency occurs when the source and the observer are in relative motion to one another. Its known military applications include the detection and location of submarines, control of antisubmarine weapons, mine hunting and depth measurement of sea.
In Astronomy, astronomers use the Doppler effect to calculate the speeds of distant stars and galaxies. By comparing the line spectrum of light from the star with light from a laboratory source, the Doppler shift of the star's light can be measured. Then, the speed of the star can be calculated.
(i) Stars moving away from the Earth show a red shift as shown in Fig.7.16(b). The emitted waves have a longer wavelength than if the star had been at rest. So, the spectrum is shifted towards longer wavelength, i.e., towards the red end of the spectrum. Astronomers have also discovered that all the distant galaxies are moving away from us and by measuring their red shifts, they have estimated their speeds.
(ii) Stars moving towards the Earth show a blue shift as shown in Fig.7.16(c). This is because the wavelength of light emitted by the star are shorter than if the star had been at rest. So, the spectrum is shifted towards shorter wavelength, I.e., to the blue end of the spectrum.
Another important application of the Doppler shift using electromagnetic waves is the radar speed trap. Microwaves are emitted from a transmitter in short bursts. Each burst is reflected off by any car in the path of microwaves in between sending out bursts. The transmitter is open to detect reflected microwaves. If the reflection is caused by a moving obstacle, the reflected microwaves are Doppler shifted. By measuring the Doppler shift, the speed at which the car moves is
Fig. 7.16

calculated by computer programme.
Satellite Navigation uses Doppler shift to determine satellite velocity and position, enabling accurate location tracking.
Satellite Communication also uses Doppler shift compensation ensuring stable communication signals.
Doppler radar detects wind velocity and precipitation patterns. Doppler shift helps measure Earth's surface velocity and deformation.
Doppler echocardiography measures blood flow velocity and detects cardiac abnormalities, such as valve stenosis or regurgitation. Doppler echocardiography optimizes pacemaker settings.
Doppler ultrasound measures blood flow and calculates cardiac output. Doppler ultrasound detects vascular stenosis or occlusion.

Example 7.12 The wavelength of one of its lines of the absorption spectrum of a faint galaxy is identified as $\mathrm{Ca}-\alpha$ line found to be 478 nm . The wavelength of same line is observed and measured as 397 nm in the laboratory.
(a) Is the galaxy moving towards or away from the Earth?
(b) Compute the speed of the galaxy relative to the Earth.

# Solution

Laboratory measured original wavelength

$$
\lambda=397 \mathrm{~nm}=397 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}
$$

Changed or Apparent wavelength $\quad \lambda^{\prime}=478 \mathrm{~nm}=478 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}$
Speed of light

$$
c=3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\because & v=f \lambda \\
\therefore & c=f \lambda \quad(\because v=c) \\
\Rightarrow & f=\frac{c}{\lambda} \\
& f=\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{397 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}} \\
& f=7.56 \times 10^{-3} \times 10^{6} \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Laboratoy frequency $f=7.56 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}$
Apparent frequency $f^{\prime}=\frac{c}{\lambda^{\prime}}$

$$
=\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{478 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}}
$$

$$
f^{\prime}=6.28 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

# $\because \quad \lambda^{\prime}>\lambda$ or $\quad f^{\prime}<f$

$\therefore$ The galaxy is moving away from the Earth.
(b)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f^{\prime}=\left(\frac{v}{v+u_{s}}\right) f \\
& f^{\prime}=\left(\frac{c}{c+u_{s}}\right) f \quad(\because v=c)
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the values, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 6.28 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}=\left(\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}+u_{s}}\right) 7.56 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz} \text { Galactic Motion } \\
& 3 \times 10^{6}+u_{s}=\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \times 7.58 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}}{6.28 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}} \\
& u_{s}=\frac{22.68 \times 10^{6}}{6.28}-3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\
& u_{s}=6.12 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

A galaxy is moving away from us at $20 \%$ of the speed of light (i.e., 0.2 c ). We observe a spectral line from this galaxy that is normally emitted at a wavelength of 600 nm .
