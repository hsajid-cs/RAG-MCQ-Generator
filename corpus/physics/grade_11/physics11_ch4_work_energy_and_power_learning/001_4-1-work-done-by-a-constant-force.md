### 4.1 WORK DONE BY A CONSTANT FORCE

Let us consider an object which is being pulled by a constant force $F$. The force displaces the object through a displacement $d$ in the direction of force. In such a case, work $W$ is defined as the product of the magnitude of the force $F$ and magnitude of the displacement d. This can be written as:

$$
W=F d
$$

Equation (4.1) shows that if the displacement is zero, no work is done even if a large force is applied. For example, pushing on a wall may tire your muscles, but work done is zero as shown in Fig. 4.1.
The force applied on a body may not always be in the direction of force as shown in Fig. (4.2). If the force $F$ makes an angle 0 with the displacement $d$ (Fig. 4.3), the work done is equal to the product of the component of force along the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of displacement. Then
Fig. 4.2

From the definition of work, we find that:
(i) Work is a scalar quantity.
(ii) If $\theta<90^{\circ}$, work is done and it is said to be positive work.
(iii) If $\theta=90^{\circ}$, no work is done.
(iv) If $\theta>90^{\circ}$, the work done is said to be negative.
(v) Sl unit of work is N m , also known as joule (J).

# 4.2 WORKDONE BYAVARIABLEFORCE

In many cases, the force does not remain constant during the process of doing work. For example, as a rocket moves away from the Earth, work is done against the force of gravity, which varies as the inverse square of the distance from the Earth's centre. Similarly, the force exerted by a spring increases with the amount of stretch. How can we calculate the work done in such situations?

Figure 4.5 shows the path of a particle in the $x y$ plane as it moves from point $P$ to point $Q$. The path has been divided into $n$ short intervals of displacements $\Delta d_{1}, \Delta d_{2}, \ldots \ldots, \Delta d_{n}$ and $F_{1}, F_{2}, \ldots \ldots, F_{n}$ are the forces acting during these intervals, respectively.

During each small interval, the force is supposed to be approximately constant. So, the work done for the first interval can then be written as
$\Delta W_{1}=\mathbf{F}_{1} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{d}_{1}=F_{1} \cos \theta_{1} \Delta d_{1}$
and in the second interval
$\Delta W_{2}=F_{2} \cdot \Delta d_{2}=F_{2} \cos \theta_{2} \Delta d_{2}$
and so on. The total work done in moving the object can be calculated by adding all these terms.

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_{\text {total }} & =\Delta W_{1}+\Delta W_{2}+\ldots \ldots+\Delta W_{n} \\
& =F_{1} \cos \theta_{1} \Delta d_{1}+F_{2} \cos \theta_{2} \Delta d_{2}+\ldots \ldots+F_{n} \cos \theta_{n} \Delta d_{n} \\
\text { or } \quad W_{\text {total }} & =\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d_{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can examine this graphically by plotting $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ as shown in Fig. 4.6. The displacement $d$ has been sub-divided into the same $n$ equal Intervals. The value of $F \cos \theta$ at the beginning of each interval is indicated in the figure.
Fig. 4.5
A particle acted upon by a variable force, moves along the path shown from point $P$ to point $Q$.
Fig. 4.6

Now the $i^{\text {th }}$ shaded rectangle has an area $F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d$ which is the work done during the $i^{\text {th }}$ interval. Thus, the work done given by Eq. 4.4 equals the sum of the areas of all the rectangles. If we sub-divide the distance into a large number of intervals so that each $\Delta d$ becomes very small, the work done given by Eq. 4.4 becomes more accurate. If we let each $\Delta d$ to approach zero, then we obtain an exact result for the work done, such as:

$$
W_{\text {total }}=\underset{\Delta d \rightarrow 0}{\text { Limit }} \sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d_{i}
$$

If this limit $\Delta d$ approaches zero, the total area of all the rectangles (Fig. 4.6) approaches the area between the $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ curve and $x$-axis from P to Q as shown shaded in Fig. 4.7.
Thus, the work done by a variable force in moving a particle between two points is equal to the area under the $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ curve between the two points $P$ and $Q$ as shown in Fig. 4.7.
Fig. 4.7

Example 4.3 A force $F$ acting on an object varies with distance $d$ as shown in Fig. 4.8. Calculate the work done by the force as the object moves from $d=0$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$.
Solution The work done by the force is equal to the total area under the curve from $d=0$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$. This area is equal to the area of the rectangular section from $d=0$ to

$d=4 \mathrm{~m}$, plus the area of triangular section from $d=4 \mathrm{~m}$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$.

Hence
Work done represented by the area of rectangle $=4 \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mathrm{~N}$
$=20 \mathrm{Nm}=20 \mathrm{~J}$
Work done represented by the area of triangle $=\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mathrm{~N}$
$=5 \mathrm{Nm}=5 \mathrm{~J}$
Therefore, the total work done
$=20 \mathrm{~J}+5 \mathrm{~J}=25 \mathrm{~J}$

# 4.3 CONSERVATIVE AND NON-CONSERVATIVE FORCES

## Conservative Forces

The space around the Earth In which its gravitational force acts on a body is called the gravitational field. When an object is moved in the gravitational field, the work is done by the gravitational force. If displacement is in the direction of gravitational force, the work is positive. If the displacement is against the gravitational force, the work is said to be negative.
There is an interesting property of the gravitational force that when an object is moved from one place to another, the work done by the gravitational force does not depend on the choice of the path. Let us explore it. Consider an object of mass $m$ being displaced with constant speed from point $A$ to $B$ along various paths in the presence of a gravitational force (Fig. 4.9). In this case, the gravitational force is equal to the weight
Fig. 4.9
$m g$ of the object.
The work done by the gravitational force along the path 1 (ADB) can be split into two parts (path AD and path DB). The work done along AD is zero, because the weight mg is perpendicular to this path, whereas the work done along DB is ( $-m g h$ ) because the direction of $m g$ is opposite to that of the displacement i.e., $\theta=180^{\circ}$. Hence, the work done in displacing a body from $A$ to $B$ through path 1 is:

$$
W_{\text {ace }}=0+(-m g h)=-m g h
$$

If we consider the path 2 (ACB), the work done along AC is also (-mgh). Since the work done along CB is zero, therefore,

$$
W_{\text {ace }}=-m g h+0=-m g h
$$

Now consider path 3, i.e., a curved one. Imagine the curved path to be broken down into a

series of horizontal and vertical steps as shown in Fig. 4.10. There is no work done along the horizontal steps, because $m g$ is perpendicular to the displacement for these steps. Work is done by the force of gravity only along the vertical displacements. During the segment CD, $m g$ is not negative; it is positive. But here all $\Delta y$ elements are negative, so the products of $m g$ and $\Delta y$ for all the elements will again be negative. Therefore, we can write:

$$
W_{A B}=-m g\left(\Delta y_{1}+\Delta y_{2}+\Delta y_{3}+\ldots \ldots+\Delta y_{n}\right)
$$

As

$$
\Delta y_{1}+\Delta y_{2}+\Delta y_{3}+\ldots \ldots+\Delta y_{n}=h
$$

Hence

$$
W_{A B}=-m g h
$$

Fig. 4.10
A smooth path may be replaced by a series of infinitesimal $x$ and $y$ displacements. Work is done only during the $y$ displecements.

The net amount of work done along the curved path $A B$ is still (-mgh). We conclude from the above discussion that:

# Work done by gravitational force is independent of the path followed.

Can you prove that the work done, along a closed path, such as ACBA or ADBA (Fig. 4.9), by the gravitational force is zero?

If the work done by a force in moving an object between two points is independent of the path followed or the work done in a closed path be zero, the force is called a conservative force.
As shown above, the gravitational force is a conservative force, other examples of conservative force are electrostatic force and elastic spring force.

## Non-Conservative Forces

All types of forces are not conservative forces.
A force is non-conservative if the work done by it in moving an object between two points or in a closed path depends on the path of motion.
The kinetic frictional force is a non-conservative force. When an object slides over a surface, the kinetic frictional force always acts opposite to the motion and does negative work equal in magnitude to the frictional force multiplied by the length of the path. Thus, greater amount of work is done over a longer path between any two points. Hence, the work depends on the choice of path. Moreover, the total work done by a nonconservative force in a closed path is notzero.
Other examples of non-conservative force are air resistance, tension in a string, normal force and propulsion force of a rocket.
