### 4.7 WORK-ENERGY THEOREM

Whenever work is done on a body, it increases its energy. For example, if a force $F$ acts on a body of mass $m$, initially moving with velocity $v_{r}$, through a distance $d$ and increases its velocity to $v_{r}$, then the acceleration produced will be:

$$
2 a d=v_{r}^{2}-v_{r}^{2}
$$

# Physics II

or

$$
a=\frac{1}{2 d}\left(v_{f}^{2}-v_{f}^{2}\right)
$$

From the second law of motion:

$$
F=m a
$$

or

$$
a=\frac{F}{m}
$$

Comparing Eqs. 4.16 and 4.17, we have

$$
\frac{F}{m}=\frac{1}{2 d}\left(v_{f}^{2}-v_{f}^{2}\right)
$$

or

$$
F d=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}
$$

All the food you eat in one day has about the same energy as $1 / 3$ litre of petrol
or

$$
F d=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}
$$

This expression is the work-energy theorem. It states that:
The change in kinetic energy of an object is equal to the work done on it by a net force.
$W=$ Change in kinetic energy $=(K . E)_{t}-(K . E)_{t}=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}$
This is also known as work-energy principle.
The work-energy theorem is applicable for any direction of the force relative to the displacement. For instance, an object with kinetic energy can perform work if it is allowed to push or pull on another object. In this case, the work will be taken as negative and the kinetic energy of the object will decrease. The theorem remains valid even if the force may vary from point to point.

Example 4.4 A motorcycle rider weighing 80 kg is coasting down a $24^{\circ}$ slope. The weight of motorcycle is 30 kg . At the top of the slope, the speed of motorcycle is $3.2 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. If the kinetic frictional force is 100 N , what will be the speed of the motorcycle 72 m downhill?
Solution The normal force $F_{n}$ is balanced by the component of weight (mgcos $24^{\circ}$ ) perpendicular to the slope, Let the kinetic frictional force is $f$, then the net force Fis:
or

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=m g \sin 24^{\circ}-f \quad \text { where } m=\text { total mass }=60 \mathrm{~kg}+30 \mathrm{~kg}=90 \mathrm{~kg} \\
& F=\left(90 \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \times 0.4\right)-100 \mathrm{~N} \\
& F=252.8 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

Wok done $W=F d=252.8 \mathrm{~N} \times 72 \mathrm{~m}=18201.8 \mathrm{~J}$
As work is positive, so applying work-energy theorem,

$$
W=(K . E)_{t}-(K . E)_{t}
$$

Form here,

$$
(K . E)_{t}=W+(K . E)_{t}
$$

Putting the values, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2} & =W+\frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2} \\
\frac{1}{2} \times 90 \mathrm{~kg} \times v_{i}^{2} & =18201 \mathrm{~J}+\frac{1}{2} \times 90 \mathrm{~kg} \times\left(3.2 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2} \\
\text { This gives, } \quad v_{i}^{2} & =414.7 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
\text { or } \quad v_{i} & =\sqrt{414.7 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}=20.4 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 4.8 INTERCONVERSION OF POTENTIAL ENERGY AND KINETIC ENERGY

Consider a body of mass $m$ at rest, at a height $h$ above the surface of the Earth as shown in Fig. 4.12. At position A, the body has $P . E .=m g h$ and $K . E .=0$. We release the body and as it falls, we can examine how kinetic and potential energies associated with it interchange.
Let us calculate P.E. and K.E. at the position B when the body has fallen a distance $x$, ignoring air friction.
Now, height from the ground is $(h-x)$, so that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P . E .=m g(h-x) \\
& K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{B}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

and

$$
\text { P.E }=m g h
$$

Fig. 4.12

Velocity $v_{B}$, at position $B$, can be calculated from the relation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{i}^{2} & =v_{i}^{2}+2 g S \\
v_{i} & =0 \\
v_{B}^{2} & =0+2 g x \\
v_{B}^{2} & =2 g x
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore

$$
\begin{aligned}
K . E . & =\frac{1}{2} m(2 g x) \\
& =m g x
\end{aligned}
$$

Total energy at position $B=P . E .+K . E$.

$$
\text { Total energy } \quad=m g(h-x)+m g x=m g h
$$

At position C, just before the body strikes the Earth, P.E. $=0$ and $K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{c}^{2}$, where $v_{c}$ can be found out by the following expression.

i.e.,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{c}^{2}=v_{i}^{2}+2 g h=2 g h \text { as } v_{i}=0 \\
& K . E=\frac{1}{2} m v_{c}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} m \times 2 g h=m g h
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, at point $C$, kinetic energy is equal to the original value of the potential energy of the body. Actually, when a body falls, its velocity increases i.e., the body is being accelerated under the action of gravity. The increase in velocity results in the increase in its kinetic energy. On the other hand, as the body falls, its height decreases and hence, its potential energy also decreases. Thus, we see (Fig. 4.13) that:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Loss in P.E. = Gain in K.E } \\
m g\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2} m\left(v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

where $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are he velocities of the body at the heights $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ respectively. This result is true only when frictional force is not considered.
If we assume that a frictional force $f$ is present during the downward motion, then a part of P.E. is used in doing work against friction equal to $f h$. The remaining $P . E .=m g h-f h$ is converted into K.E.

Hence

$$
m g h-f h=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
$$

or

$$
m g h=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+f h
$$

Thus
Loss in P.E. = Gain in K.E. + Work done against friction
Conversely,
Loss of K.E. = Gain in P.E. + Work done against friction

# Example 4.5

A car weighing 1100 kg is moving with a velocity of $12 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. When it is at point $P$, its engine stops. If the frictional force is 120 N , what will be its velocity at point $Q$ ? How far beyond $Q$ will it go before coming to rest?

## Solution

The kinetic energy possessed by the car at point $P$ will partly be converted into P.E. and partly used up in doing work against friction as it reaches point $Q$. Therefore, Loss of K.E. = Gain in P.E. + Work against friction
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{2} m\left(v_{i}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}\right)=w h+f d \\
& \frac{1}{2} \times 1100 \mathrm{~kg}\left(144 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}\right)-(1100 \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \times 1.5 \mathrm{~m})+120 \mathrm{~N} \times 24 \mathrm{~m} \\
& 550 \mathrm{~kg}\left(144 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}\right)=16170 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}+2880 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
& \left(144 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}\right)=\frac{16170 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}+2880 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}{550 \mathrm{~kg}}=34.6 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
& v_{i}^{2}=144 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}-34.6 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}=109.4 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Velocity at point $Q, \quad v_{i}=\sqrt{109.4 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}=10.5 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$
Now if the car stops at point $R$, then using the formula:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}-f S \\
\frac{1}{2} \times 1100 \mathrm{~kg} \times 109.4 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}=120 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \times S \\
S=501 \mathrm{~m} \text {. approximately }
\end{gathered}
$$

Example 4.6 An object of mass 3 kg falls from a height of 15 m . If it strikes the ground with a velocity of $16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, calculate tha average frictional force of the air.
Solution Loss of $P . E=$ Gain in $K . E+$ Work done against friction

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \because v_{1}=0, \quad m g h=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+f h \\
& 3 \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \times 15 \mathrm{~m}=\frac{1}{2} \times 3 \mathrm{~kg}\left(16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}+f \times 15 \mathrm{~m} \\
& 441 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \leqslant 384 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}+15 \mathrm{~m} \times f \\
& \text { or } \\
& f=\frac{441 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}-384 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}{15 \mathrm{~m}}=3.8 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2}=3.8 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$
