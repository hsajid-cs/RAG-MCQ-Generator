## Work, Energy and Power

## Learning Objectives

After studying this chapter, the students will be able to:

- Derive the formula for kinetic energy [using the equations of motion]
- Derive an expression for absolute potential energy of a body at a certain position in the gravitational field [including escape velocity]
- Deduce the work done from force-displacement graph.
- Differentiate between conservative and non-conservative forces.
- State and use the work - energy theorem in a resistive medium to solve problems.

Work is often thought in terms of physical or mental effort. In Physics, however, the termwork involves two things (i) force, and (ii) displacement. We shall begin with a simple situation in which work is done by a constant force.

### 4.1 WORK DONE BY A CONSTANT FORCE

Let us consider an object which is being pulled by a constant force $F$. The force displaces the object through a displacement $d$ in the direction of force. In such a case, work $W$ is defined as the product of the magnitude of the force $F$ and magnitude of the displacement d. This can be written as:

$$
W=F d
$$

Equation (4.1) shows that if the displacement is zero, no work is done even if a large force is applied. For example, pushing on a wall may tire your muscles, but work done is zero as shown in Fig. 4.1.
The force applied on a body may not always be in the direction of force as shown in Fig. (4.2). If the force $F$ makes an angle 0 with the displacement $d$ (Fig. 4.3), the work done is equal to the product of the component of force along the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of displacement. Then
Fig. 4.2

From the definition of work, we find that:
(i) Work is a scalar quantity.
(ii) If $\theta<90^{\circ}$, work is done and it is said to be positive work.
(iii) If $\theta=90^{\circ}$, no work is done.
(iv) If $\theta>90^{\circ}$, the work done is said to be negative.
(v) Sl unit of work is N m , also known as joule (J).

# 4.2 WORKDONE BYAVARIABLEFORCE

In many cases, the force does not remain constant during the process of doing work. For example, as a rocket moves away from the Earth, work is done against the force of gravity, which varies as the inverse square of the distance from the Earth's centre. Similarly, the force exerted by a spring increases with the amount of stretch. How can we calculate the work done in such situations?

Figure 4.5 shows the path of a particle in the $x y$ plane as it moves from point $P$ to point $Q$. The path has been divided into $n$ short intervals of displacements $\Delta d_{1}, \Delta d_{2}, \ldots \ldots, \Delta d_{n}$ and $F_{1}, F_{2}, \ldots \ldots, F_{n}$ are the forces acting during these intervals, respectively.

During each small interval, the force is supposed to be approximately constant. So, the work done for the first interval can then be written as
$\Delta W_{1}=\mathbf{F}_{1} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{d}_{1}=F_{1} \cos \theta_{1} \Delta d_{1}$
and in the second interval
$\Delta W_{2}=F_{2} \cdot \Delta d_{2}=F_{2} \cos \theta_{2} \Delta d_{2}$
and so on. The total work done in moving the object can be calculated by adding all these terms.

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_{\text {total }} & =\Delta W_{1}+\Delta W_{2}+\ldots \ldots+\Delta W_{n} \\
& =F_{1} \cos \theta_{1} \Delta d_{1}+F_{2} \cos \theta_{2} \Delta d_{2}+\ldots \ldots+F_{n} \cos \theta_{n} \Delta d_{n} \\
\text { or } \quad W_{\text {total }} & =\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d_{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can examine this graphically by plotting $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ as shown in Fig. 4.6. The displacement $d$ has been sub-divided into the same $n$ equal Intervals. The value of $F \cos \theta$ at the beginning of each interval is indicated in the figure.
Fig. 4.5
A particle acted upon by a variable force, moves along the path shown from point $P$ to point $Q$.
Fig. 4.6

Now the $i^{\text {th }}$ shaded rectangle has an area $F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d$ which is the work done during the $i^{\text {th }}$ interval. Thus, the work done given by Eq. 4.4 equals the sum of the areas of all the rectangles. If we sub-divide the distance into a large number of intervals so that each $\Delta d$ becomes very small, the work done given by Eq. 4.4 becomes more accurate. If we let each $\Delta d$ to approach zero, then we obtain an exact result for the work done, such as:

$$
W_{\text {total }}=\underset{\Delta d \rightarrow 0}{\text { Limit }} \sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d_{i}
$$

If this limit $\Delta d$ approaches zero, the total area of all the rectangles (Fig. 4.6) approaches the area between the $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ curve and $x$-axis from P to Q as shown shaded in Fig. 4.7.
Thus, the work done by a variable force in moving a particle between two points is equal to the area under the $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ curve between the two points $P$ and $Q$ as shown in Fig. 4.7.
Fig. 4.7

Example 4.3 A force $F$ acting on an object varies with distance $d$ as shown in Fig. 4.8. Calculate the work done by the force as the object moves from $d=0$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$.
Solution The work done by the force is equal to the total area under the curve from $d=0$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$. This area is equal to the area of the rectangular section from $d=0$ to

$d=4 \mathrm{~m}$, plus the area of triangular section from $d=4 \mathrm{~m}$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$.

Hence
Work done represented by the area of rectangle $=4 \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mathrm{~N}$
$=20 \mathrm{Nm}=20 \mathrm{~J}$
Work done represented by the area of triangle $=\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mathrm{~N}$
$=5 \mathrm{Nm}=5 \mathrm{~J}$
Therefore, the total work done
$=20 \mathrm{~J}+5 \mathrm{~J}=25 \mathrm{~J}$

# 4.3 CONSERVATIVE AND NON-CONSERVATIVE FORCES

## Conservative Forces

The space around the Earth In which its gravitational force acts on a body is called the gravitational field. When an object is moved in the gravitational field, the work is done by the gravitational force. If displacement is in the direction of gravitational force, the work is positive. If the displacement is against the gravitational force, the work is said to be negative.
There is an interesting property of the gravitational force that when an object is moved from one place to another, the work done by the gravitational force does not depend on the choice of the path. Let us explore it. Consider an object of mass $m$ being displaced with constant speed from point $A$ to $B$ along various paths in the presence of a gravitational force (Fig. 4.9). In this case, the gravitational force is equal to the weight
Fig. 4.9
$m g$ of the object.
The work done by the gravitational force along the path 1 (ADB) can be split into two parts (path AD and path DB). The work done along AD is zero, because the weight mg is perpendicular to this path, whereas the work done along DB is ( $-m g h$ ) because the direction of $m g$ is opposite to that of the displacement i.e., $\theta=180^{\circ}$. Hence, the work done in displacing a body from $A$ to $B$ through path 1 is:

$$
W_{\text {ace }}=0+(-m g h)=-m g h
$$

If we consider the path 2 (ACB), the work done along AC is also (-mgh). Since the work done along CB is zero, therefore,

$$
W_{\text {ace }}=-m g h+0=-m g h
$$

Now consider path 3, i.e., a curved one. Imagine the curved path to be broken down into a

series of horizontal and vertical steps as shown in Fig. 4.10. There is no work done along the horizontal steps, because $m g$ is perpendicular to the displacement for these steps. Work is done by the force of gravity only along the vertical displacements. During the segment CD, $m g$ is not negative; it is positive. But here all $\Delta y$ elements are negative, so the products of $m g$ and $\Delta y$ for all the elements will again be negative. Therefore, we can write:

$$
W_{A B}=-m g\left(\Delta y_{1}+\Delta y_{2}+\Delta y_{3}+\ldots \ldots+\Delta y_{n}\right)
$$

As

$$
\Delta y_{1}+\Delta y_{2}+\Delta y_{3}+\ldots \ldots+\Delta y_{n}=h
$$

Hence

$$
W_{A B}=-m g h
$$

Fig. 4.10
A smooth path may be replaced by a series of infinitesimal $x$ and $y$ displacements. Work is done only during the $y$ displecements.

The net amount of work done along the curved path $A B$ is still (-mgh). We conclude from the above discussion that:

# Work done by gravitational force is independent of the path followed.

Can you prove that the work done, along a closed path, such as ACBA or ADBA (Fig. 4.9), by the gravitational force is zero?

If the work done by a force in moving an object between two points is independent of the path followed or the work done in a closed path be zero, the force is called a conservative force.
As shown above, the gravitational force is a conservative force, other examples of conservative force are electrostatic force and elastic spring force.

## Non-Conservative Forces

All types of forces are not conservative forces.
A force is non-conservative if the work done by it in moving an object between two points or in a closed path depends on the path of motion.
The kinetic frictional force is a non-conservative force. When an object slides over a surface, the kinetic frictional force always acts opposite to the motion and does negative work equal in magnitude to the frictional force multiplied by the length of the path. Thus, greater amount of work is done over a longer path between any two points. Hence, the work depends on the choice of path. Moreover, the total work done by a nonconservative force in a closed path is notzero.
Other examples of non-conservative force are air resistance, tension in a string, normal force and propulsion force of a rocket.

### 4.4 POWER

In the definition of work, it is not clear, whether the same amount of work is done in one second or in one hour. The rate, at which work is done, is often of interest in practical applications.

# Piyalue

Power is the measure of the rate at which work is being done.
If work $\Delta W$ is done in a time interval $\Delta t$, then the average power $P_{w}$ during the interval $\Delta t$ is defined as:

$$
P_{w}=\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}
$$

If work is expressed as a function of time, the instantaneous power $P$ at any instant is defined as:

$$
P=\operatorname{Limit}_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}
$$

where $\Delta W$ is the work done in short interval of time $\Delta t$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Since } \\
& \Delta W=F \cdot \Delta d \\
& \text { Hence } \\
& P=\frac{F \cdot \Delta d}{\Delta t}=F \cdot \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} \\
& \text { Since } \\
& \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}=v \\
& \text { Hence } \\
& P=F \cdot v
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, power may also be defined as the scaler product of $F$ and $V$.
The SI unit of power is watt, defined as one joule of work done in one second.
Sometimes, for example, in the electrical measurements, the unit of work is expressed as watt second. However, a commercial unit of electrical energy is kilowatt-hour.
One kilowatt- hour is the work done in one hour by an agency whose power is one kilowatt.
Therefore

$$
1 \mathrm{kWh}=1000 \mathrm{~W} \times 3600 \mathrm{~s}
$$

or

$$
1 \mathrm{kWh}=3.6 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~J}=3.6 \mathrm{MJ}
$$

$$

## It takes about $9 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~J}$ of energy to make a car and the car then uses about $1 \times 10^{17} \mathrm{~J}$ of energy from petrol in its life time.

### 4.5 ENERGY

Energy of a body is its capacity to do work. There are two basic forms of energy:

# Physics II

(i) Kinetic energy
(ii) Potential energy

Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body due to its motion and potential energy is the energy possessed by a body due to its changed position.
The kinetic energy and the potential energy both are the kinds of mechanical energy.

## Kinetic Energy

Let us derive a formula for the kinetic energy of a moving body. Consider a car running with a constant speed on a road. If its engine is switched OFF, it will still cover some distance before stopping. As long as it is moving, it is doing work against the force of friction of the road. In other words, during this interval, it will exert a force equal in magnitude to the force of friction $f$. Let the distance travelled before coming to rest be $d$, then the work done by the car would be $f d$. This work is done by the car due to its motion. The ability of a body to do work due to its motion is its kinetic energy. Therefore, kinetic energy of the car is equal to $f d$. The acceleration can be found by using Newton's second law of motion, i.e.,

$$
F=m a
$$

As the car slows down and finally stops, its acceleration a is negative because it is produced by force of friction $f$ acting apposite to the direction of motion. Thus,

$$
f=-m a
$$

or

$$
a=-\frac{f}{m}
$$

We can now determine the value of $(f d)$ by using the third equation of motion, i.e;

$$
2 a S=v^{2}-v^{2}
$$

Here, Initial velocity $\quad v_{i}=v$
Final velocity $\quad v_{f}=0$
Distance $\quad S=d$
Acceleration $\quad a=-\frac{f}{m}$
Putting values in the above equation of motion, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 \times\left(\frac{-f}{m}\right) d & =0-v^{2} \\
f d & =\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

As $f d$ is equal to the kinetic energy of body, therefore,

$$
\text { Kinetic energy }=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
$$

Since, kinetic energy is equal to work which the body is capable of doing, so the unit of kinetic energy must be that of work, i.e. joule (J).
Example 4.3 A car weighing 18620 N is running with a speed of $16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. Brakes are applied and it is brought to rest in a distance of 60 m . Determine the average force of

friction acting on it.

# Solation

Given that $\quad v=16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, d=80 \mathrm{~m}, w=18620 \mathrm{~N}$ and $f=$ ?
The kinetic energy of the car is equal to the work done by it before stopping, i.e.,

$$
\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=f d
$$

Here

$$
m=\frac{w}{g}=\frac{18620 \mathrm{~N}}{9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}=1900 \mathrm{~kg}
$$

Putting the value in the above equation, we have

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 1900 \mathrm{~kg} \times\left(16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}=f \times 80
$$

or

$$
f=3040 \mathrm{~N}
$$

## Potential Energy

The potential energy is possessed by a body because of its position in a force field, e.g. gravitational field or because of its constrained state.
The energy stored in a compressed spring is the potential energy possessed by the spring due to its compressed or stretched state. This form of energy is called the elastic potential energy.

## Absolute Potential Energy

The absolute gravitational potential energy of an object at a certain position is the work done by the gravitational force in displacing the object from that position to infinity where the force of gravity becomes zero.
The relation for the calculation of the work done by the gravitational force or potential energy is $m g h$, which is true only near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational force is nearly constant. But if the body is displaced through a large distance in space, let it be from point 1 to N (Fig. 4.11) in the gravitational field, then the gravitational force will not remain constant, since it varies inversely to the square of the distance.
In order to overcome this difficulty, we divide the distance between points 1 and N into small steps each of length $\Delta r$ so that the value of the force remains constant for each small step. Hence, the total work done can be calculated by adding the work done during all these steps. If $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are the
Fig. 4.11
distances of points 1 and 2 respectively, from the centre $O$ of the Earth (Fig. 4.11.), the

work done during the first step i.e., displacing a body from point 1 to point 2 can be calculated as below. The distance between the centre of this step and centre of the Earth will be:

$$
r=\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{2}
$$

As

$$
r_{2}-r_{1}=\Delta r \quad \text { then } \quad r_{2}=r_{1}+\Delta r
$$

Hence

$$
r=\frac{r_{1}+r_{1}+\Delta r}{2}=r_{1}+\frac{\Delta r}{2}
$$

The gravitational force $F$ at the centre of this step is:

$$
F=G \frac{M m}{r^{2}}
$$

where $m=$ mass of an object, $M=$ mass of the Earth and $G=$ Gravitational constant
Squaring Eq. 4.10

$$
\begin{aligned}
& r^{2}=\left(r_{1}+\frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^{2} \\
& r^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+2 r_{1} \frac{\Delta r}{2}+\left(\frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

There is more energy reaching Earth in 10 days of sunlight than in all the fossil fuels on the Earth.

As $(\Delta r)^{2} \ll r_{1}{ }^{2}$, so $(\Delta r)^{2}$ can be neglected as compared to $r_{1}{ }^{2}$.
Hence

$$
r^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+r_{1} \Delta r
$$

Putting the value of $\Delta r=r_{2}-r_{1}$

$$
r^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+r_{1}\left(r_{1}-r_{1}\right)=r_{1} r_{2}
$$

Hence, Eq. 4.11 becomes

$$
F=G \frac{M m}{r_{1} r_{2}}
$$

As this force is assumed to be constant during the interval $\Delta r$, so the work done is:

$$
W_{1} \rightarrow_{2}=F \Delta r=F \Delta r \cos 180^{\circ}=-G M m \frac{\Delta r}{r_{1} r_{2}}
$$

The negative sign indicates that the work has to be done on the body from point 1 to 2 because displacement is opposite to gravitational force. Putting the value of $\Delta r$, we have

$$
W_{1}>_{2}=-G M m \frac{r_{2}-r_{1}}{r_{1} r_{2}}
$$

or

$$
W_{1} \rightarrow_{2}=-G M m\left(\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\frac{1}{r_{2}}\right)
$$

Similarly, the work done during the second step in which the body is displaced from point 2 to 3 is:

$$
W_{2} \rightarrow_{3}=-G M m\left(\frac{1}{r_{2}}-\frac{1}{r_{2}}\right)
$$

and the work done in the last step is:

$$
W_{N-1} \rightarrow_{N}=-G M m \frac{1}{\left(N-1-\frac{1}{r_{N}}\right)}
$$

More coal has been used since 1945 than was used in the whole of history before that.

Hence, the total work done in displacing a body from point 1 to N is calculated by adding up the work done during all these steps.

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_{\text {tutel }} & =W_{1} \rightarrow_{2}+W_{2} \rightarrow_{3}+\ldots \ldots . .+W_{N-1} \rightarrow_{N} \\
& =-G M m\left[\left(\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\frac{1}{r_{2}}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{r_{2}}-\frac{1}{r_{3}}\right)+\ldots \ldots+\left(\frac{1}{r_{N-1}} \frac{1}{r_{N}}\right)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

On simplification, we have

$$
W_{\text {totel }}=-G M m\left(\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\frac{1}{r_{N}}\right)
$$

If the point N is situated at an infinite distance from the Earth, then

Hence

$$
r_{N}=\infty \quad ; \quad \text { so } \quad \frac{1}{r_{N}}=\frac{1}{\infty}=0
$$

This total work by definition is the absolute potential energy (P.E) as stated earlier represented by $U$.

$$
U=-\frac{G M m}{r}
$$

This is also known as the absolute value of gravitational potential energy of a body at a distance $r$ from the centre of the Earth.
Note that when $r$ increases, $U$ becomes less negative i.e., $U$ increases. It means when we raise a body above the surface of the Earth, its P.E. increases. Therefore, if we want to raise the body up to infinite distance, we will have to do work on it equal to $\frac{G M m}{R}$, so thatits P.E. becomes zero.
Now the absolute potential energy on the surface of the Earth is found by putting $r=R$ (Radius of the Earth), so

$$
\text { Absolute potential energy }=U_{0}=-\frac{G M m}{R}
$$

The negative sign shows that the Earth's gravitational field for mass $m$ is attractive. The above expression gives the work or the energy required to take the body out of the

Earth's gravitational field, where its potential energy with respect to Earth is zero.

# 4.6 ESCAPE VELOCITY

It is our daily life experience that an object projected upward comes back to the ground after rising to a certain height. This is due to the force of gravity acting downward. With increased initial velocity, the object rises to the greater height before coming back. If we go on increasing the initial velocity of the object, a stage comes when it will not return to the ground. It will escape from the influence of gravity.

The initial velocity of an object with which it goes out of the Earth's gravitational field, is known as escape velocity.

## Some Escape speeds (km s)

| Heavendy body Escape speed |  |
| :--: | :--: |
| Moon | 2.4 |
| Mercury | 4.3 |
| Mars | 5.0 |
| Venus | 10.4 |
| Earth | 11.2 |
| Uranus | 22.4 |
| Neptune | 25.4 |
| Saturn | 37.0 |
| Jupiter | 61 |

The escape velocity corresponds to the initial kinetic energy gained by the body, which carries it to an infinite distance from the surface of the Earth.

$$
\text { Initial } K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{\text {sec }}^{2}
$$

We know that the work done in lifting a body from Earth's surface to an infinite distance is equal to the increase in potential energy

$$
\text { Incerase in } P . E .=0-\left(-G \frac{M m}{R}\right)=G \frac{M m}{R}
$$

where $M$ and $R$ are the mass and radius of the Earth respectively. The body will escape out of the gravitational field if the initial $K . E$. of the body is equal to increase in $P . E$. Then

$$
\frac{1}{2} m v_{\text {sec }}^{2}=G \frac{M m}{R}
$$

or

$$
v_{\text {ess }}=\sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{R}}
$$

As

$$
g=\frac{G M}{R^{2}} \quad \text { or } \quad g R=\frac{G M}{R}
$$

Hence

$$
v_{\text {ess }}=\sqrt{2 g R}
$$

The value of $v_{\text {sec }}$ comes out to be approximately $11 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.

### 4.7 WORK-ENERGY THEOREM

Whenever work is done on a body, it increases its energy. For example, if a force $F$ acts on a body of mass $m$, initially moving with velocity $v_{r}$, through a distance $d$ and increases its velocity to $v_{r}$, then the acceleration produced will be:

$$
2 a d=v_{r}^{2}-v_{r}^{2}
$$

# Physics II

or

$$
a=\frac{1}{2 d}\left(v_{f}^{2}-v_{f}^{2}\right)
$$

From the second law of motion:

$$
F=m a
$$

or

$$
a=\frac{F}{m}
$$

Comparing Eqs. 4.16 and 4.17, we have

$$
\frac{F}{m}=\frac{1}{2 d}\left(v_{f}^{2}-v_{f}^{2}\right)
$$

or

$$
F d=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}
$$

## 1444

## 1444

All the food you eat in one day has about the same energy as $1 / 3$ litre of petrol
or

$$
F d=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}
$$

This expression is the work-energy theorem. It states that:
The change in kinetic energy of an object is equal to the work done on it by a net force.
$W=$ Change in kinetic energy $=(K . E)_{t}-(K . E)_{t}=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}$
This is also known as work-energy principle.
The work-energy theorem is applicable for any direction of the force relative to the displacement. For instance, an object with kinetic energy can perform work if it is allowed to push or pull on another object. In this case, the work will be taken as negative and the kinetic energy of the object will decrease. The theorem remains valid even if the force may vary from point to point.

Example 4.4 A motorcycle rider weighing 80 kg is coasting down a $24^{\circ}$ slope. The weight of motorcycle is 30 kg . At the top of the slope, the speed of motorcycle is $3.2 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. If the kinetic frictional force is 100 N , what will be the speed of the motorcycle 72 m downhill?
Solution The normal force $F_{n}$ is balanced by the component of weight (mgcos $24^{\circ}$ ) perpendicular to the slope, Let the kinetic frictional force is $f$, then the net force Fis:
or

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=m g \sin 24^{\circ}-f \quad \text { where } m=\text { total mass }=60 \mathrm{~kg}+30 \mathrm{~kg}=90 \mathrm{~kg} \\
& F=\left(90 \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \times 0.4\right)-100 \mathrm{~N} \\
& F=252.8 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

Wok done $W=F d=252.8 \mathrm{~N} \times 72 \mathrm{~m}=18201.8 \mathrm{~J}$
As work is positive, so applying work-energy theorem,

$$
W=(K . E)_{t}-(K . E)_{t}
$$

Form here,

$$
(K . E)_{t}=W+(K . E)_{t}
$$

Putting the values, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2} & =W+\frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2} \\
\frac{1}{2} \times 90 \mathrm{~kg} \times v_{i}^{2} & =18201 \mathrm{~J}+\frac{1}{2} \times 90 \mathrm{~kg} \times\left(3.2 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2} \\
\text { This gives, } \quad v_{i}^{2} & =414.7 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
\text { or } \quad v_{i} & =\sqrt{414.7 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}=20.4 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}

# 4.8 INTERCONVERSION OF POTENTIAL ENERGY AND KINETIC ENERGY

Consider a body of mass $m$ at rest, at a height $h$ above the surface of the Earth as shown in Fig. 4.12. At position A, the body has $P . E .=m g h$ and $K . E .=0$. We release the body and as it falls, we can examine how kinetic and potential energies associated with it interchange.
Let us calculate P.E. and K.E. at the position B when the body has fallen a distance $x$, ignoring air friction.
Now, height from the ground is $(h-x)$, so that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P . E .=m g(h-x) \\
& K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{B}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

and

$$
\text { P.E }=m g h
$$

Fig. 4.12

Velocity $v_{B}$, at position $B$, can be calculated from the relation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{i}^{2} & =v_{i}^{2}+2 g S \\
v_{i} & =0 \\
v_{B}^{2} & =0+2 g x \\
v_{B}^{2} & =2 g x
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore

$$
\begin{aligned}
K . E . & =\frac{1}{2} m(2 g x) \\
& =m g x
\end{aligned}
$$

Total energy at position $B=P . E .+K . E$.

$$
\text { Total energy } \quad=m g(h-x)+m g x=m g h
$$

At position C, just before the body strikes the Earth, P.E. $=0$ and $K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{c}^{2}$, where $v_{c}$ can be found out by the following expression.

i.e.,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{c}^{2}=v_{i}^{2}+2 g h=2 g h \text { as } v_{i}=0 \\
& K . E=\frac{1}{2} m v_{c}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} m \times 2 g h=m g h
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, at point $C$, kinetic energy is equal to the original value of the potential energy of the body. Actually, when a body falls, its velocity increases i.e., the body is being accelerated under the action of gravity. The increase in velocity results in the increase in its kinetic energy. On the other hand, as the body falls, its height decreases and hence, its potential energy also decreases. Thus, we see (Fig. 4.13) that:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Loss in P.E. = Gain in K.E } \\
m g\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2} m\left(v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

where $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are he velocities of the body at the heights $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ respectively. This result is true only when frictional force is not considered.
If we assume that a frictional force $f$ is present during the downward motion, then a part of P.E. is used in doing work against friction equal to $f h$. The remaining $P . E .=m g h-f h$ is converted into K.E.

Hence

$$
m g h-f h=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
$$

or

$$
m g h=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+f h
$$

Thus
Loss in P.E. = Gain in K.E. + Work done against friction
Conversely,
Loss of K.E. = Gain in P.E. + Work done against friction

# Example 4.5

A car weighing 1100 kg is moving with a velocity of $12 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. When it is at point $P$, its engine stops. If the frictional force is 120 N , what will be its velocity at point $Q$ ? How far beyond $Q$ will it go before coming to rest?

## Solution

The kinetic energy possessed by the car at point $P$ will partly be converted into P.E. and partly used up in doing work against friction as it reaches point $Q$. Therefore, Loss of K.E. = Gain in P.E. + Work against friction
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{2} m\left(v_{i}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}\right)=w h+f d \\
& \frac{1}{2} \times 1100 \mathrm{~kg}\left(144 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}\right)-(1100 \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \times 1.5 \mathrm{~m})+120 \mathrm{~N} \times 24 \mathrm{~m} \\
& 550 \mathrm{~kg}\left(144 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}\right)=16170 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}+2880 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
& \left(144 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}\right)=\frac{16170 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}+2880 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}{550 \mathrm{~kg}}=34.6 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
& v_{i}^{2}=144 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}-34.6 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}=109.4 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Velocity at point $Q, \quad v_{i}=\sqrt{109.4 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}=10.5 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$
Now if the car stops at point $R$, then using the formula:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}-f S \\
\frac{1}{2} \times 1100 \mathrm{~kg} \times 109.4 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}=120 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \times S \\
S=501 \mathrm{~m} \text {. approximately }
\end{gathered}
$$

Example 4.6 An object of mass 3 kg falls from a height of 15 m . If it strikes the ground with a velocity of $16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, calculate tha average frictional force of the air.
Solution Loss of $P . E=$ Gain in $K . E+$ Work done against friction

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \because v_{1}=0, \quad m g h=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+f h \\
& 3 \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \times 15 \mathrm{~m}=\frac{1}{2} \times 3 \mathrm{~kg}\left(16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}+f \times 15 \mathrm{~m} \\
& 441 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \leqslant 384 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}+15 \mathrm{~m} \times f \\
& \text { or } \\
& f=\frac{441 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}-384 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}{15 \mathrm{~m}}=3.8 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2}=3.8 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$
