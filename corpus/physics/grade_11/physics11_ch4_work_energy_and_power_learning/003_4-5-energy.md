### 4.5 ENERGY

Energy of a body is its capacity to do work. There are two basic forms of energy:

# Physics II

(i) Kinetic energy
(ii) Potential energy

Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body due to its motion and potential energy is the energy possessed by a body due to its changed position.
The kinetic energy and the potential energy both are the kinds of mechanical energy.

## Kinetic Energy

Let us derive a formula for the kinetic energy of a moving body. Consider a car running with a constant speed on a road. If its engine is switched OFF, it will still cover some distance before stopping. As long as it is moving, it is doing work against the force of friction of the road. In other words, during this interval, it will exert a force equal in magnitude to the force of friction $f$. Let the distance travelled before coming to rest be $d$, then the work done by the car would be $f d$. This work is done by the car due to its motion. The ability of a body to do work due to its motion is its kinetic energy. Therefore, kinetic energy of the car is equal to $f d$. The acceleration can be found by using Newton's second law of motion, i.e.,

$$
F=m a
$$

As the car slows down and finally stops, its acceleration a is negative because it is produced by force of friction $f$ acting apposite to the direction of motion. Thus,

$$
f=-m a
$$

or

$$
a=-\frac{f}{m}
$$

We can now determine the value of $(f d)$ by using the third equation of motion, i.e;

$$
2 a S=v^{2}-v^{2}
$$

Here, Initial velocity $\quad v_{i}=v$
Final velocity $\quad v_{f}=0$
Distance $\quad S=d$
Acceleration $\quad a=-\frac{f}{m}$
Putting values in the above equation of motion, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 \times\left(\frac{-f}{m}\right) d & =0-v^{2} \\
f d & =\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

As $f d$ is equal to the kinetic energy of body, therefore,

$$
\text { Kinetic energy }=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
$$

Since, kinetic energy is equal to work which the body is capable of doing, so the unit of kinetic energy must be that of work, i.e. joule (J).
Example 4.3 A car weighing 18620 N is running with a speed of $16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. Brakes are applied and it is brought to rest in a distance of 60 m . Determine the average force of

friction acting on it.

# Solation

Given that $\quad v=16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, d=80 \mathrm{~m}, w=18620 \mathrm{~N}$ and $f=$ ?
The kinetic energy of the car is equal to the work done by it before stopping, i.e.,

$$
\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=f d
$$

Here

$$
m=\frac{w}{g}=\frac{18620 \mathrm{~N}}{9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}=1900 \mathrm{~kg}
$$

Putting the value in the above equation, we have

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 1900 \mathrm{~kg} \times\left(16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}=f \times 80
$$

or

$$
f=3040 \mathrm{~N}
$$

## Potential Energy

The potential energy is possessed by a body because of its position in a force field, e.g. gravitational field or because of its constrained state.
The energy stored in a compressed spring is the potential energy possessed by the spring due to its compressed or stretched state. This form of energy is called the elastic potential energy.

## Absolute Potential Energy

The absolute gravitational potential energy of an object at a certain position is the work done by the gravitational force in displacing the object from that position to infinity where the force of gravity becomes zero.
The relation for the calculation of the work done by the gravitational force or potential energy is $m g h$, which is true only near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational force is nearly constant. But if the body is displaced through a large distance in space, let it be from point 1 to N (Fig. 4.11) in the gravitational field, then the gravitational force will not remain constant, since it varies inversely to the square of the distance.
In order to overcome this difficulty, we divide the distance between points 1 and N into small steps each of length $\Delta r$ so that the value of the force remains constant for each small step. Hence, the total work done can be calculated by adding the work done during all these steps. If $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are the
Fig. 4.11
distances of points 1 and 2 respectively, from the centre $O$ of the Earth (Fig. 4.11.), the

work done during the first step i.e., displacing a body from point 1 to point 2 can be calculated as below. The distance between the centre of this step and centre of the Earth will be:

$$
r=\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{2}
$$

As

$$
r_{2}-r_{1}=\Delta r \quad \text { then } \quad r_{2}=r_{1}+\Delta r
$$

Hence

$$
r=\frac{r_{1}+r_{1}+\Delta r}{2}=r_{1}+\frac{\Delta r}{2}
$$

The gravitational force $F$ at the centre of this step is:

$$
F=G \frac{M m}{r^{2}}
$$

where $m=$ mass of an object, $M=$ mass of the Earth and $G=$ Gravitational constant
Squaring Eq. 4.10

$$
\begin{aligned}
& r^{2}=\left(r_{1}+\frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^{2} \\
& r^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+2 r_{1} \frac{\Delta r}{2}+\left(\frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

There is more energy reaching Earth in 10 days of sunlight than in all the fossil fuels on the Earth.

As $(\Delta r)^{2} \ll r_{1}{ }^{2}$, so $(\Delta r)^{2}$ can be neglected as compared to $r_{1}{ }^{2}$.
Hence

$$
r^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+r_{1} \Delta r
$$

Putting the value of $\Delta r=r_{2}-r_{1}$

$$
r^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+r_{1}\left(r_{1}-r_{1}\right)=r_{1} r_{2}
$$

Hence, Eq. 4.11 becomes

$$
F=G \frac{M m}{r_{1} r_{2}}
$$

As this force is assumed to be constant during the interval $\Delta r$, so the work done is:

$$
W_{1} \rightarrow_{2}=F \Delta r=F \Delta r \cos 180^{\circ}=-G M m \frac{\Delta r}{r_{1} r_{2}}
$$

The negative sign indicates that the work has to be done on the body from point 1 to 2 because displacement is opposite to gravitational force. Putting the value of $\Delta r$, we have

$$
W_{1}>_{2}=-G M m \frac{r_{2}-r_{1}}{r_{1} r_{2}}
$$

or

$$
W_{1} \rightarrow_{2}=-G M m\left(\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\frac{1}{r_{2}}\right)
$$

Similarly, the work done during the second step in which the body is displaced from point 2 to 3 is:

$$
W_{2} \rightarrow_{3}=-G M m\left(\frac{1}{r_{2}}-\frac{1}{r_{2}}\right)
$$

and the work done in the last step is:

$$
W_{N-1} \rightarrow_{N}=-G M m \frac{1}{\left(N-1-\frac{1}{r_{N}}\right)}
$$

More coal has been used since 1945 than was used in the whole of history before that.

Hence, the total work done in displacing a body from point 1 to N is calculated by adding up the work done during all these steps.

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_{\text {tutel }} & =W_{1} \rightarrow_{2}+W_{2} \rightarrow_{3}+\ldots \ldots . .+W_{N-1} \rightarrow_{N} \\
& =-G M m\left[\left(\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\frac{1}{r_{2}}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{r_{2}}-\frac{1}{r_{3}}\right)+\ldots \ldots+\left(\frac{1}{r_{N-1}} \frac{1}{r_{N}}\right)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

On simplification, we have

$$
W_{\text {totel }}=-G M m\left(\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\frac{1}{r_{N}}\right)
$$

If the point N is situated at an infinite distance from the Earth, then

Hence

$$
r_{N}=\infty \quad ; \quad \text { so } \quad \frac{1}{r_{N}}=\frac{1}{\infty}=0
$$

This total work by definition is the absolute potential energy (P.E) as stated earlier represented by $U$.

$$
U=-\frac{G M m}{r}
$$

This is also known as the absolute value of gravitational potential energy of a body at a distance $r$ from the centre of the Earth.
Note that when $r$ increases, $U$ becomes less negative i.e., $U$ increases. It means when we raise a body above the surface of the Earth, its P.E. increases. Therefore, if we want to raise the body up to infinite distance, we will have to do work on it equal to $\frac{G M m}{R}$, so thatits P.E. becomes zero.
Now the absolute potential energy on the surface of the Earth is found by putting $r=R$ (Radius of the Earth), so

$$
\text { Absolute potential energy }=U_{0}=-\frac{G M m}{R}
$$

The negative sign shows that the Earth's gravitational field for mass $m$ is attractive. The above expression gives the work or the energy required to take the body out of the

Earth's gravitational field, where its potential energy with respect to Earth is zero.

# 4.6 ESCAPE VELOCITY

It is our daily life experience that an object projected upward comes back to the ground after rising to a certain height. This is due to the force of gravity acting downward. With increased initial velocity, the object rises to the greater height before coming back. If we go on increasing the initial velocity of the object, a stage comes when it will not return to the ground. It will escape from the influence of gravity.

The initial velocity of an object with which it goes out of the Earth's gravitational field, is known as escape velocity.

## Some Escape speeds (km s)

| Heavendy body Escape speed |  |
| :--: | :--: |
| Moon | 2.4 |
| Mercury | 4.3 |
| Mars | 5.0 |
| Venus | 10.4 |
| Earth | 11.2 |
| Uranus | 22.4 |
| Neptune | 25.4 |
| Saturn | 37.0 |
| Jupiter | 61 |

The escape velocity corresponds to the initial kinetic energy gained by the body, which carries it to an infinite distance from the surface of the Earth.

$$
\text { Initial } K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{\text {sec }}^{2}
$$

We know that the work done in lifting a body from Earth's surface to an infinite distance is equal to the increase in potential energy

$$
\text { Incerase in } P . E .=0-\left(-G \frac{M m}{R}\right)=G \frac{M m}{R}
$$

where $M$ and $R$ are the mass and radius of the Earth respectively. The body will escape out of the gravitational field if the initial $K . E$. of the body is equal to increase in $P . E$. Then

$$
\frac{1}{2} m v_{\text {sec }}^{2}=G \frac{M m}{R}
$$

or

$$
v_{\text {ess }}=\sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{R}}
$$

As

$$
g=\frac{G M}{R^{2}} \quad \text { or } \quad g R=\frac{G M}{R}
$$

Hence

$$
v_{\text {ess }}=\sqrt{2 g R}
$$

The value of $v_{\text {sec }}$ comes out to be approximately $11 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.
