### 10.8 FACTORS AFFECTING EMF

## 1. Rate of Change of Magnetic Flux

Faraday's law suggests that faster changes in magnetic flux result in greater induced emf.

## 2. Number of Turns of the Coil

According to Faraday's law, induced emf is also proportional to the number of turns of the coil. More turns result in a greater induced emf.

## 3. Relative Speed

The speed of the coil (or conductor) through a magnetic field also affects the magnitude of the induced emf. Faster speed increases the rate of change of magnetic flux that results into an increase in the induced emf.
