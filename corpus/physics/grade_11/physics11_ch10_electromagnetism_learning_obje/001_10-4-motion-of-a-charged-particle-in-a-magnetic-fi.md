### 10.4 MOTION OF A CHARGED PARTICLE IN A MAGNETIC FIELD

We have observed that a current-carrying conductor placed perpendicularly in a uniform magnetic field experiences a force $F$. Since a current is the flow of electric charges, it raises the question: do individual charges moving through a magnetic field also experience a force? The answer is yes. Experiments show that a charged particle does experience a force when it moves across a magnetic field. We can calculate this force by examining the behaviour of a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field.
Consider a conductor of length $L$ through which $N$ charged particles, each with charge $q$, are passing in time $t$. The motion of these charged particles produces a current / in the conductor, which is given by

$$
i=\frac{Q}{t}=\frac{N q}{t}
$$

## Like electric field lines, magnetic field lines also never cross each other. However, they can attract or repel each other.
where $Q$ is the total charge flowing in time $t$. If $v$ is the velocity of charged particles, then the velocity of the particles along the conductor is

$$
\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v} \mathbf{L}
$$

where $\mathbf{L}$ is the unit vector in the direction of the current. The sign of the force depends on whether the charge $q$ is positive or negative. However, the unit vector $\mathbf{L}$ is directed along the direction of the current, which is the direction of motion of positive charges.
Since the particles take time $t$ to move across the conductor of length $L$, therefore,

## Point to ponder 11

Why does a ploture become distorted when a magnetic bar is brought near to the screen of TV, computer monitor or oscilloscope?

If this conductor is placed in a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, it will experience a force $F$, as given by Eq.10.3.

$$
F=I L \times B
$$

As

$$
L=L \dot{L}
$$

Substituting the values of $I$ and $L$ in Eq. (10.3), we have

$$
F=\frac{N q v}{L}(L \dot{L} \times B)
$$

or

$$
F=N q v \dot{L} \times B
$$

As velocity $v$ is directed along the conductor $L$, so we can write: $v \dot{L}=v \dot{v}=v$ (as $\dot{L}=\dot{v}$ )

$$
F=N q(v \times B)
$$

Therefore the force on a single particle will be

$$
F=q(v \times B)
$$

Fig. 10.10

If 0 is the angle between $B$ and $v$, then magnitude of force $F$ is given by

$$
F=q v B \sin \theta
$$

Therefore, the force is maximum when $B$ is perpendicular to $v$, i.e., $\theta=90^{\circ}$, and force is zero when $B$ is in the direction of $v$, i.e., $\theta=0$. The direction of force can be known by applying Fleming's left hand rule or right hand rule for vector product.
(a) The positively charged particle enters into the magnetic field along the dotted line on plane of paper. It experiences a force in the upward direction due to which it is deflected along a curved path (Fig. 10.10-a).
(b) The negatively charged particle is deflected downward by the force acting on it downwards (Fig. 10.10-b).
Example 10.3 An election enters into a uniform magnetic field perpendicularly with a speed of $10^{4} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. What path the electron will move along inside the field?
$\left(B=2.5 \mathrm{~Wb} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}, \quad m=9.11 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~kg}, \quad e=1.6 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{C}\right)$
Solution The Force $F$ acting on the electron will be:

$$
F=q v B \sin \theta
$$

As the velocity $v$ is perpendicular to $B$, i.e., $\theta=90^{\circ}$, the charge $q=e$, so

$$
F=e v B \times 1=e v B
$$

Since $F$ acts perpendicular to $v$, so this force provides centripetal force to the electron to keep it in a circle of radius $r$. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
g v B & =\frac{m v^{2}}{r} \\
r & =\frac{m v}{\theta B}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the values in above equation, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& r-\frac{9.11 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{~kg} \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{1}}{1.6 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{C} \times 2.5 \mathrm{~Wb} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}} \\
& r=2.3 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

The path of electron will be a circle of radius $2.3 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}$.

# 10.5 VELOCITY SELECTOR

A velocity selector is a device used to determine the velocity of a charged particle. In this device, electric and magnetic forces are applied to the moving particle in such a way that they balance each other only for one value of velocity, allowing the particle to continue moving with a constant velocity.
Consider a particle with a positive charge $+q$ that enters a uniform magnetic field $B$ at a right angles to it, with a velocity $v$. The magnetic force acts on the particle in the upward direction, as shown in Fig. 10.11. To balance this magnetic force, an electric force must act downward on the particle.
A velocity selector consists of a cylindrical tube located within a magnetic field $B$. Inside the tube is a parallel plate capacitor that creates a uniform electric field $E$. The electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field B, as shown in Fig. 10.12.

B into the paper
Fig. 10.11
Fig. 10.12

When the charged particle enters the left end of the tube, the magnetic force acts upward, while the electric force acts downward in the direction of the electric field $E$ on the positively charged particle. If the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields are adjusted appropriately, these forces will cancel each other out. With no net force acting on the particle, its velocity $v$ remains constant in accordance with Newton's first law. As a result, the particle moves in a straight line at a constant velocity and exits the right end of the tube.
The particles with velocities different from $v$ will be deflected and will not exit at the right end of the tube.

The magnitude of the velocity selected can be determined as below.
As the velocity $v$ is perpendicular to both $B$ and $E$, therefore,
Magnetic force (upward) $=B q v$
Electric force (downward) $=q E$
For no deflection of particle, $\quad B q v=q E$
or

$$
v=\frac{E}{B}
$$

Example 10.4 Alpha particles ranging in speed from $1000 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ to $2000 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ enter into a velocity selector where the electric intensity is $300 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ and the magnetic induction 0.20 T . Which particle will move undeviated through the field?

Solution

$$
E=300 \mathrm{Vm}^{-1}=300 \mathrm{NC}^{-1}, \quad B=0.20 \mathrm{~T}
$$

Only those particles will be able to pass through the plate for which the electric force $q E$ acting on the particles balances the magnetic force $B q v$ on the particles as shown in the Fig. 10.12.
Therefore

$$
q E=B q v
$$

A force is exerted on a moving charged particle in a magnetic field. In what direction it should move that the force is not exerted on it?

Thus, the selected speed is:

$$
v=\frac{E}{B}=\frac{300 \mathrm{NC}^{-1}}{0.20 \mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}}=1500 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

The alpha particles having a speed of $1500 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ will move undeviated through the field.
Example 10.5 A charged particle moves through a velocity selector at a constant velocity in a straight line. The electric field of the velocity selector is $4.8 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$, while the magnetic field is 0.2 T . When the electric filed is turned OFF, the charged particle travels on a circular path of radius 3.0 cm . Find the charge to mass ratio of the particle.

Solution Since the particle is moving in a direction perpendicular to both $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, so the magnitude of velocity $v$ will be given by

$$
q E=B q v \quad \text { or } \quad v=\frac{E}{B}
$$

When the electric filed is turned off, the particle will move along a circular path of radius $r$. Then the magnetic force provides necessary centripetal force. Then

So, charge to mass ratio becomes:

$$
B q v=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}
$$

$$
\frac{q}{m}=\frac{v}{B r}
$$

Putting the value of $v=\frac{E}{B}$, we have

$$
\frac{q}{m}=\frac{E}{B^{2} r}
$$

Putting the values of $E, B$ and $r$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{q}{m} & =\frac{4.8 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}}{(0.20 \mathrm{~T})^{1}\left(3 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}\right)} \\
& =\frac{4.8 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}}{1.2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}}=4 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{C} \mathrm{~kg}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 10.6 INDUCED EMF AND FARADAY'S LAW

It has been observed experimentally that when a conductor moves across a magnetic field, an electromotive force (emf) is induced between its ends. The induced emf in the moving conductor is similar to that of a battery. That is, if the ends of the conductor are connected by a wire to form a closed circuit, a current will flow through it.

The emf induced by the motion of a conductor across a magnetic field is called motional emf.
Consider an experiment as shown in Fig. 10.13. A conducting rod of length $L$ is placed on two parallel metal rails separated by a distance $L$. A galvanometer is connected between the ends $c$ and $d$ of the rails. This forms a complete conducting loop abode. A uniform magnetic field $B$ is applied directed into the page. Initially, when the rod is stationary, galvanometer indicates no current in the loop. If the rod is pulled to the right
Fig. 10.13
with constant velocity $v$, the galvanometer indicates a current flowing through the loop. Obviously, the current is induced due to the motion of the conducting rod across the magnetic field. The moving rod is acting as a source of emf $\varepsilon=V_{a}-V_{a}=\Delta V$.
When the rod moves, a charge $q$ within the rod also moves with the same velocity $v$ in the magnetic field $B$ and experiences a force given by, Eq. 10.13.

$$
F=q(v \times B)
$$

The magnitude of the force is:

$$
F=q \vee B \sin 0
$$

Since angle $\theta$ between $v$ and $B$ is $90^{\circ}$, so

$$
F=q \vee B
$$

Applying right hand rule, we see that the force $F$ acting on the charge $q$ is directed from point a to point $b$ along the rod. As a result, charges migrate to the top end of the conductor. As more charges move, a concentration of charge builds up at the top end $b$, while there is a deficiency of charges at the bottom end $a$. This redistribution of charge creates an electrostatic field $E$ directed from $b$ to $a$. The electrostatic force on the charge is $F_{e}=q E$ directed from $b$ to $a$. The system quickly reaches an equilibrium state

where these two forces on the charge are balanced. If $E$ is the electric field intensity in this state, then

$$
q E=q v B
$$

or

$$
E=v B
$$

The motional emf $\varepsilon$ will be equal to the potential difference $\Delta V=V_{0}-V_{0}$ between the two ends of the moving conductor in this equilibrium state. The gradient of potential is given by $\Delta V / L$. As the electric intensity is given by the negative of the gradient, therefore,

$$
E=-\frac{\Delta V}{L}
$$

or

$$
\Delta V=-L E=-(L v B)
$$

The motional emf is:

$$
\varepsilon=\Delta V=L v B
$$

This is the magnitude of motional emf. However, if the angle between $v$ and $B$ is 0 , then

$$
\varepsilon=-v B L \sin \theta
$$

Due to the induced emf, positive charges flow along the path abcds; therefore, the induced current is anticlockwise in the diagram. As the current flows, the quantity of charge at the top decreases, which reduces the electric field intensity, while the magnetic force remains unchanged. This imbalance disturbs the equilibrium in favour of the magnetic force. Consequently, as the charges reach the end ' $a$ ' of the conductor due to the current flow, they are carried back to the top end 'b' by the unbalanced magnetic field, and the current continues to flow.

# Faraday's Law

The motional emf induced in a rod moving perpendicular to a magnetic field is $\varepsilon=-v B L$. The motional emf as well as other induced emfs can be described in terms of magnetic flux. Consider the experiment shown in Fig. 10.14 again. Let the conducting rod be moving from position 1 to position 2 in a
# Physica 11

small interval of time $\Delta t$. The distance travelled by the rod in time $\Delta t$ is $x_{2}-x_{1}=\Delta x$.
Since the rod is moving with constant velocity $v$, therefore,

$$
v=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
$$

Putting this value of $v$ in Eq. 10.19, we have

$$
\varepsilon=-v B L=-\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} B L
$$

As the rod moves through the distance $\Delta x$, the increase in the area of loop is given by $\Delta A=\Delta x L$. This increases the flux through the loop by $\Delta \phi_{0}=(\Delta A) B$. Putting $(\Delta x L) B=\Delta \phi_{0}$ in Eq. 10.22, we have

$$
\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta \phi_{0}}{\Delta t}
$$

Eqation(10.20) shows that if the magnetic flux is changing through the single loop of a conducting coil, then the negative of the rate of change of magnetic flux is equal to the emf induced in the loop.
If there is a coil of $N$ loops instead of a single loop, then the induced emf will become $N$ times.
i.e., $\varepsilon=-N \frac{\Delta \phi_{0}}{\Delta t}$
Although the above expression is derived on the basis of motional emf, but it is true in general. This conclusion was first arrived at by Faraday, so this is known as Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction which states that:

The average emf induced in a conducting coil of $N$ loops is equal to the negative of the rate at which the magnetic flux through the coil is changing with time.

The minus sign indicates that the direction of the induced emf is such that it opposes the change in flux.
