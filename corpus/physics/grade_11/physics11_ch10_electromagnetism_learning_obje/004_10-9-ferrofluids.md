### 10.9 FERROFLUIDS

Ferrofluid is a unique material that exhibits both liquid and magnetic properties. It operates through a combination of magnetic and fluid dynamics principles.
Essentially, the ferrofluid is a colloidal suspension of magnetic particles in a carrier fluid (such as oil or water). Typically, the magnetic particles are iron oxide, ground to the nano-scale and approximately 10 nanometres in size. These particles are coated with a surfactant, a substance that reduces surface tension. This coating prevents the particles from clumping together, ensuring they remain evenly dispersed in the fluid. The

viscosity of the fluid, the nanometre size of the particles, and their constant movement prevent the particles from settling down.
When there is no magnet around, a ferrofluid acts like a liquid, but when there is a magnet nearby, the particles are temporarily magnetized and the fluid becomes a magnet. They form structures within the fluid causing the ferrofluid to act more like a solid. When the magnet is removed, the particles are demagnetized and the ferrofluid acts like a liquid again.

The first ferrofluid developed by NASA in 1960, was ground from natural magnetite. Ferrofluid was invented to move liquids through
specs.

This phenomenon is due to the competition between magnetic forces, surface tension and gravity. In the presence of strong magnetic field, the formation of chain-like structures is a result of magnetic forces pulling the fluid upwards while gravity and surface tension work to pull it back down. These chains align along the magnetic field lines and increase the viscosity, making it behave like a solid bulging in certain directions. These are commonly known as spikes. However, the spikes are formed where the magnetic forces overcome the other forces (Fig.10.17).

The following experiment will exhibit this phenomenon.

# Experiment

You need some laser printer toner, some cocking oil, a test tube, a glass bottle, a small stick and a magnet.

## Procedure

Pour some toner in the test tube. Remember that laser printer toner contains $40 \%$ iron oxide in nanometre particle size. Add some cooking oil in it and mix it well with the stick to form ferrofluid. Put this fluid in the bottle. The fluid will act like a liquid on shaking the bottle. Now bring the magnet near to fluid outside of the bottle.
You will observe that the fluid jumps towards the magnet, because it has itself become a magnet. If we hold the magnet on the side of the bottle, you will see a structure with spikes formed by the fluid as shown in Fig. 10.18.

# Applications of Ferrofluids

There are many applications of ferrofluids in the fields of electronics, medicine, engineering, and active research in Physics and Material science. In electronics, ferrofluids are used in rotary seals for computer hard drives and other rotating shaft motors. In loudspeakers, ferrofluids are used to cool the voice coil which can heat up during operation. The magnetic field holds the fluid in place around the coil, allowing it to absorb and dissipate heat more effectively. Ferrofluids are also used in speakers to dampen vibrations and improve sound quality.
In medical applications, ferrofluids can be directed to specific areas in the body using external magnets, allowing for targeted drug delivery. The magnetic particles can carry drugs directly to a tumor or other targeted site, reducing side effects and improving treatment efficiency. Ferrofluids can also be used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Other applications of ferrofluids include damping or precisely controlling the flow of liquids by manipulating the magnetic field.
