### 6.1 ASSUMPTIONS OF THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES

The kinetic theory of gases is a fundamental theory in physics and chemistry that explains the behaviour of gases based on the motion of their constituent particles. This theory provides a macroscopic understanding of gas properties such as pressure, temperature, and volume. Here are the key assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases.

## 1. Gas Particles are in Constant, Random Motion

Gas molecules are in perpetual, random motion. They move in straight lines until they collide with either another molecule or the walls of the container.

## 2. Negligible Volume of Gas Particles

The volume of the individual gas molecules is negligible as compared to the total volume of the gas. This means that the particles are considered point masses with no significant volume.

## 3. No Intermolecular Forces

There are no attractive or repulsive forces between the gas molecules. The particles do not exert any force on each other except during collisions.

## 4. Elastic Collisions

The collisions between gas molecules, and with the walls of the container are perfectly elastic. This means that there is no net loss of kinetic energy during collisions. The total kinetic energy is conserved.

## 5. Large Number of Particles

A gas contains a large number of particles. This large number allows for the use of statistical methods to describe the properties of the gas.

## 6. Average Kinetic Energy is Proportional to Temperature

The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. This implies that as the temperature increases, the speed of the gas particles also increases.

## 7. Pressure due to Particle Collisions

The pressure exerted by a gas on the walls of its container is due to the collisions of gas

particles with the walls. The force exerted by the particles during collisions generates pressure.

# 8. Time of Collisions is Negligible

The time interval of a collision between gas particles is extremely short compared to the time between collisions. This assumption simplifies the analysis of particle dynamics.

## Limitations of Kinetic Molecular Theory

## Real Gases

The assumptions of the kinetic theory hold true for ideal gases, but real gases exhibit deviations due to intermolecular forces and finite molecular volume, especially at high pressures and low temperatures.
In summary, the kinetic theory of gases provides a macroscopic view of gas behaviour, linking macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature to the motion of gas particles, and serves as a foundational concept in understanding thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

## Equation of State for an Ideal Gas

A gas that obeys kinetic theory of gases is termed as an ideal gas. Ideal gas equation is given by

$$
P V=n R T \quad \ldots(6.1)
$$

Here $P$ represents pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is number of moles of the gas, $R$ is universal gas constant ( $R=8.3145 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}$ ) and $T$ is the absolute temperature.
Equation (6.1) implies that product of pressure and volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature for an ideal gas.

## Real Gas to Behays Like an Ideal Gas

According to kinetic theory of gases, a gas has no intermolecular interaction and molecules are far apart from each other. For a real gas to behave like an ideal gas, some conditions must be satisfied. P.E. of the gas molecules is negligible and this have only K.E.

Number of moles ' $n$ 'can be given by

$$
n=\frac{\text { Mass of gas }}{\text { Molar mass of gas }}=\frac{m}{M}
$$

So, Eq. (6.1) becomes: $P V=\frac{m}{M} R T \quad$ or $\quad P M=\left(\frac{m}{V}\right) R T$
We know that density; $\rho=\frac{m}{V}, \quad$ So, $\quad \rho=\frac{P M}{R T}$ as $\frac{M}{R}$ is constant $\therefore \rho \propto \frac{P}{T}$
The density of a gas will be low at low pressure and high temperature due to which molecules of the gas will be at large distance from each other and the intermolecular

forces will be negligible. So, the real gas behaves like an ideal gas at low pressure and high temperature.

# Ideal Gas Equation in Terms of Boltzmann Constant

From ideal gas equation:

$$
P V=n R T
$$

A mole can be defined as the number of atoms or molecules per unit Avogadro's number ( $N_{A}=6.02 \times 10^{20}$ ).

## Mathematically;

$$
n=\frac{N}{N_{A}}
$$

(ii) , N is number of atoms or molecules

Substituting Eq. (ii) in Eq. (i), we have

$$
P V=\frac{N}{N_{A}} R T
$$

The term $\frac{R}{N_{A}}$ is termed as Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$, i.e.,

$$
k_{B}=\frac{R}{N_{A}}
$$

(6.2)

For your information
Real gases approach ideal beheviour under:
(i) low pressure
(ii) high temperature

Substituting the values of $R$ and $N_{A}$ we have

$$
k_{B}=1.38 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~J} \cdot \mathrm{~K}^{-1}
$$

Substituting Eq. (6.2) in Eq. (iii),

$$
P V=N k_{B} T
$$

Equation (6.3) gives ideal gas equation in terms of Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$.
(1) Example 6.1 One mole of an ideal gas is at a temperature of 300 K . If the Boltzmann constant is $1.38 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$, calculate the volume of the gas at a pressure of 1 atom. [1atm $=101325 \mathrm{~Pa}]$
Solution We know that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P V=n R T \\
& R=N_{A} \times k_{B} \quad \text { where } k_{B}=\frac{R}{N_{A}} \\
& \text { Here } \quad V=\frac{n N_{A} k_{B} T}{P} \\
& \begin{array}{l}
V=\frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \times 6.02 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \times 300 \mathrm{~K}}{101325 \mathrm{~Pa}} \\
V \approx 0.0245 \mathrm{~m}^{3}
\end{array}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, volume of gas would be $0.0245 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$.

# Gas Laws

There are some variables (state functions) which describe quantity of gas which includes pressure, volume, and temperature ( $P, V$, and $T$ ) with change in one variable, the second variable changes while the third is kept constant. The laws that relate these variables mutually for an ideal gas are termed as gas laws.

## Boyle's Law

This law was introduced by Robert Boyle in 1662, and it provides a relationship between pressure and volume of a gas at constant temperature. It sates that for a fixed mass of an ideal gas, the pressure $P$ exerted by a gas varies inversely with volume $V$ occupied by the gas at constant temperature.
Mathematically;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P \propto \frac{1}{V} \text { at constant } T \\
& P=\text { constant } \frac{1}{V} \text { or } P V=\text { constant }
\end{aligned}
$$

or $\quad P_{1} V_{1}=P_{2} V_{2}$
Graphical representation of Boyle's law is shown in Fig. 6.1.

## Charles' Law

Charles' law relates volume and temperature of an ideal gas for a fixed mass at constant pressure. This law was formulated in 1870 by a French Physicist Jacques Charles. It states that the volume of given mass of gas at constant pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.
Mathematically;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V \propto T \text { atconstant } P \\
& V \\
& T=\text { constant } \\
& \text { or } \\
& \frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Graphically, it can be shown in Fig. 6.2.

## Joseph lussac's Law

Fig. 6.2

It states that for a fixed mass of an ideal gas, the pressure exerted by a gas varies directly with absolute temperature of the gas at constant volume.
Mathematically;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P \propto T \text { at constant } V \\
& P=\text { constant } \times T
\end{aligned}
$$

# Thermal Equilibrium

When two bodies are at the same temperature, the thermal energy (which is related to the kinetic energy of particles) of each body is equal. As a result, there is no driving force for heat transfer between them, and thus they remain in thermal equilibrium.

## Example

When we put a metal spoon into a hot cup of coffee:
(i) initially, the coffee is hotter than the spoon.
(ii) over time, heat flows from the coffee to the spoon.
(iii) eventually, the coffee and spoon reach at the same temperature.

Thermal equilibrium is achieved at this point, there is no net heat flow between the coffee and the spoon, and they are said to be in thermal equilibrium.
