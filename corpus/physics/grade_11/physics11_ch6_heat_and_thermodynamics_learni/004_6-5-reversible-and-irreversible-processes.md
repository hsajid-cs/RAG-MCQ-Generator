### 6.5 REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE PROCESSES

A reversible process is one which can be retraced in exactly reverse order, without producing any change in the surroundings. In the reverse process, the working substance passes through the same stages as in the direct process but thermal and mechanical effects at each stage are exactly reversed. If heat is absorbed in the direct process, it will be given out in the reverse process and if work is done by the substance in the direct process, work will be done on the substance in the reverse process. Hence, the working substance is restored to its original conditions.

A succession of events which brings the system back to its initial condition is called a cycle. A reversible cycle is the one in which all the changes are reversible.

Although no actual change is completely reversible but the processes of liquification and evaporation of a substance, performed slowly, are practically reversible. Similarly the

slow compression of a gas in a cylinder is reversible process as the compression can be changed to expansion by slowly decreasing the pressure on the piston to reverse the operation.

If a process cannot be retraced in the backward direction by reversing the controlling factors, it is an irreversible process.
All changes which occur suddenly or which involve friction or dissipation of energy through conduction, convection or radiation are irreversible. An example of highly irreversible process is an explosion.

# 6.6 HEAT ENGINE

A heat engine converts some thermal energy to mechanical work. Usually, the heat comes from the burning of a fuel. The earliest heat engine was the steam engine. It was developed on the fact that when water is boiled in a vessel covered with a lid, the steam inside tries to push the lid off showing the ability to do work. This observation helped to develop a steam engine.
The working principle of a heat engine is based on the conversion of heat energy into mechanical work through a cyclic process. Here is how a heat engine typically operates. The working principle of a heat engine involves the cyclic transfer of heat energy from a high temperature reservoir to a low temperature reservoir, with the objective of converting as much heat as possible into mechanical work. This process is governed by principles of thermodynamics and is essential in various applications where mechanical energy is required from heat sources.
