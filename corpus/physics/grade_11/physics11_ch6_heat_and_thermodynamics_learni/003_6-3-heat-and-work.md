### 6.3 HEAT AND WORK

We know that both heat and work correspond to transfer of energy by some means. The idea was first applied to the steam engine where it was natural to transfer heat in and get work out. Consequently, it made a sense to define both heat in and work out as positive quantities. Hence, work done by the system on its environment is considered positive while work done on the system by the environment is taken as negative. If an amount of heat $Q$ enters the system, it could manifest itself as either an increase in internal energy or as a resulting quantity of work performed by the system on the surrounding or both.
We can express the work in terms of directly measurable variables. Consider the gas enclosed in the cylinder with a moveable, frictionless piston of cross-sectional area $A$ as shown in Fig.6.4(a). In equilibrium, the system occupies volume $V$ and exerts a pressure $P$ on the walls of the cylinder and its piston. The force $F$ exerted by the gas on the piston is $P A$.
We assume that the gas expands through $\Delta V$ very slowly, so that it remains in equilibrium as shown in Fig. 6.4(b). As the piston moves up through a small distance $\Delta y$, the work $W$ done by the gas is:
The work done can also be calculated by area of the curve under $P-V$ graph as shown in Fig. 6.5.

## Chapter 6. Heat and Thermodynamics

Intramal energy is a function of state. Consequently, it does not depend on path but depends on initial and final states of the system. Thus, internal energy is similar to the gravitational P.E. So, like the potential energy, it is the change in internal energy and not its absolute value, which is important.
Fig. 6.4
A gas is sealed in a cylinder by a weightless, frictioneless piston. The constant downward applied force $F$ equals $P A$, and when the piston is displaced, downward work is done on the gas.
Knowing the details of the change in internal energy and the mechanical work done, we are in a position to describe the general principles which deal with heat energy and its transformation into mechanical energy. These principles are known as laws of thermodynamics.

# 6.4 FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

When heat is added to a system there is an increase in the internal energy due to the rise in temperature, an increase in pressure or change in the state. If at the same time, a substance is allowed to do work on its environment by expansion, the heat $Q$ required will be the heat necessary to change the internal energy of the substance from $U_{1}$ in the first state to $U_{2}$ in the second state plus the work $W$ done on the environment.
Thus $\quad Q=\left(U_{2}-U_{1}\right)+W$
or $\quad Q=\Delta U+W$
Thus the change in internal energy $\Delta U=U_{2}-U_{1}$ is defined as $Q-W$. Since it is the same for all processes concerning the state, the first law of thermodynamics, thus can be stated as,

In any thermodynamic process, when heat $Q$ is added to a system, this energy appears as an increase in the internal energy $\Delta U$ stored in the system plus the work $W$ done by the system on its surroundings.

1. Conservation Principle: The underlying principle of the first law of thermodynamics is the conservation of energy. It asserts that while energy can change from one form to another (such as from chemical potential energy to thermal energy), the total energy in an isolated system remains constant over time.
2. Wider Applicability: Beyond mechanical systems, the first law of thermodynamics applies universally to all forms of energy and all types of processes, including chemical reactions, electrical systems, and nuclear reactions. It provides a foundational understanding that allows scientists and engineers to predict and understand energy transformations in various contexts.
The first law of thermodynamics expresses the law of conservation of energy by affirming that energy is a conserved quantity in isolated systems. It provides a framework to understand how energy is transferred and transformed within systems without violating the fundamental principle that energy neither be created nor be destroyed.
A bicycle pump is a good example of first law of thermodynamics. When we pump on the handle rapidly, it becomes hot due to mechanical work done on the gas, raising thereby its internal energy. One such simple arrangement is shown in Fig. 6.6. It consists of a bicycle pump with a blocked outlet.
Fig. 6.6

A thermocouple connected through the blocked outlet allows the air temperature to be monitored. Thermocouple thermometer can detect a minute variation of the temperature. When the piston is rapidly pushed, thermometer shows a temperature rise due to increase of internal energy of the air. The push force does work on the air, thereby, increasing its internal energy, which is shown, by the increase in temperature of the air.
Human metabolism also provides an example of energy conservation. Human beings and other animals do work when they walk, run, or move. Work requires energy. Energy is also needed for growth to make new cells and to replace old cells that have died. Energy transforming processes that occur within an organism are named as metabolism. We can apply the first law of thermodynamics ( $\Delta U=Q-W$ ), to an organism of the human body. Work done will result in the decrease in internal energy of the body. Consequently, the body temperature or in other words internal energy is maintained by the food we eat.

Example 6.2 A gas is enclosed in a container fitted with a piston of cross-sectional area $0.10 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The pressure of the gas is maintained at $8000 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{\infty}$. When heat is slowly transferred, the piston is pushed up through a distance of 4.0 cm . If 42 J heat is transferred to the system during the expansion, what is the change in internal energy of the system?

Solution The work done by the gas is

$$
\begin{aligned}
W=P \Delta V=P A \Delta y & =8000 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{-2} \times 0.10 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \times 4.0 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m} \\
& =32 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}=32 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

The change in internal energy is found from first law of thermodynamics

$$
\Delta U=Q-W=42 \mathrm{~J}-32 \mathrm{~J}=10 \mathrm{~J}
$$

# Isothermal Process

It is a process which is carried out at constant temperature and hence the condition for the application of Boyle's law on the gas is fulfilled. Therefore, when gas expands or compresses isothermally, the product of its pressure and volume during the process remains constant. If $P_{1}, V_{1}$ are initial pressure and volume whereas $P_{2}, V_{2}$ are pressure and volume after the isothermal change takes place (Fig. 6.7-a), respectively, then

$$
P_{1} V_{1}=P_{2} V_{2}
$$

In case of an ideal gas, the P.E. associated with its molecules is zero, hence, the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, which in this case remains constant, therefore, $\Delta U=0$. Hence, the first law of thermodynamics reduces to

$$
Q=W
$$

Thus if gas expands and does external work $W$, an amount of heat $Q$ has to be supplied to the gas in order to produce an isothermal change. Since transfer of heat from one

place to another requires time, hence, to keep the temperature of the gas constant, the expansion or compression must take place slowly. The curve representing an isothermal process is called an isotherm (Fig. 6.7-a).

# Adiabatic Process

An adiabatic process is the one in which no heat enters or leaves the system. Therefore, $\Delta Q=0$ and the first law of thermodynamics gives:

$$
W=-\Delta U
$$

Why does the intemal energy of an ideal gas remain constant during isothermal expansion?

Thus, if the gas expands and does external work, it is done at the expense of the internal energy of its molecules and, hence, the temperature of the gas falls. Conversely, an adiabatic compression causes the temperature of the gas to rise becalue of the work done on the gas.
Adiabatic change occurs when the gas expands or comprased rapidly, particularly when the gas is contained in an insulated cylinder. The examples of adiabatic process are:
(i) The rapid escape of air from a burst tyre.
(ii) The rapid expansion and compression of air through which a sound wave is passing.
(iii) Cloud formation in the atmosphere.

As the temperature of the gas does not remain constant, so it has been seen that;

$$
P V^{\prime}=\text { constant }
$$

where $\gamma$ is the ratio of the molar specific heat of the gas at constant pressure to molar specific heat at constant volume ( $\gamma=\frac{C_{v}}{C_{v}}$ ). The curve representing an adiabatic process is called an adiabat (Fig.6.7-b).
