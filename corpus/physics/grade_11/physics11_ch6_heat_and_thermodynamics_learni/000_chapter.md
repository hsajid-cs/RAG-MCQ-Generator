# 6.1 ASSUMPTIONS OF THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES

The kinetic theory of gases is a fundamental theory in physics and chemistry that explains the behaviour of gases based on the motion of their constituent particles. This theory provides a macroscopic understanding of gas properties such as pressure, temperature, and volume. Thetnodynamics thus plays a key role in technology, since almost all the raw energy available for our use is liberated in the form of heat. In this chapter, we shall study the bebaviour of gases and laws of thermodynamics, their significance and applications.

### 6.1 ASSUMPTIONS OF THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES

The kinetic theory of gases is a fundamental theory in physics and chemistry that explains the behaviour of gases based on the motion of their constituent particles. This theory provides a macroscopic understanding of gas properties such as pressure, temperature, and volume. Here are the key assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases.

## 1. Gas Particles are in Constant, Random Motion

Gas molecules are in perpetual, random motion. They move in straight lines until they collide with either another molecule or the walls of the container.

## 2. Negligible Volume of Gas Particles

The volume of the individual gas molecules is negligible as compared to the total volume of the gas. This means that the particles are considered point masses with no significant volume.

## 3. No Intermolecular Forces

There are no attractive or repulsive forces between the gas molecules. The particles do not exert any force on each other except during collisions.

## 4. Elastic Collisions

The collisions between gas molecules, and with the walls of the container are perfectly elastic. This means that there is no net loss of kinetic energy during collisions. The total kinetic energy is conserved.

## 5. Large Number of Particles

A gas contains a large number of particles. This large number allows for the use of statistical methods to describe the properties of the gas.

## 6. Average Kinetic Energy is Proportional to Temperature

The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. This implies that as the temperature increases, the speed of the gas particles also increases.

## 7. Pressure due to Particle Collisions

The pressure exerted by a gas on the walls of its container is due to the collisions of gas

particles with the walls. The force exerted by the particles during collisions generates pressure.

# 8. Time of Collisions is Negligible

The time interval of a collision between gas particles is extremely short compared to the time between collisions. This assumption simplifies the analysis of particle dynamics.

## Limitations of Kinetic Molecular Theory

## Real Gases

The assumptions of the kinetic theory hold true for ideal gases, but real gases exhibit deviations due to intermolecular forces and finite molecular volume, especially at high pressures and low temperatures.
In summary, the kinetic theory of gases provides a macroscopic view of gas behaviour, linking macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature to the motion of gas particles, and serves as a foundational concept in understanding thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

## Equation of State for an Ideal Gas

A gas that obeys kinetic theory of gases is termed as an ideal gas. Ideal gas equation is given by

$$
P V=n R T \quad \ldots(6.1)
$$

Here $P$ represents pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is number of moles of the gas, $R$ is universal gas constant ( $R=8.3145 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}$ ) and $T$ is the absolute temperature.
Equation (6.1) implies that product of pressure and volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature for an ideal gas.

## Real Gas to Behays Like an Ideal Gas

According to kinetic theory of gases, a gas has no intermolecular interaction and molecules are far apart from each other. For a real gas to behave like an ideal gas, some conditions must be satisfied. P.E. of the gas molecules is negligible and this have only K.E.

Number of moles ' $n$ 'can be given by

$$
n=\frac{\text { Mass of gas }}{\text { Molar mass of gas }}=\frac{m}{M}
$$

So, Eq. (6.1) becomes: $P V=\frac{m}{M} R T \quad$ or $\quad P M=\left(\frac{m}{V}\right) R T$
We know that density; $\rho=\frac{m}{V}, \quad$ So, $\quad \rho=\frac{P M}{R T}$ as $\frac{M}{R}$ is constant $\therefore \rho \propto \frac{P}{T}$
The density of a gas will be low at low pressure and high temperature due to which molecules of the gas will be at large distance from each other and the intermolecular

forces will be negligible. So, the real gas behaves like an ideal gas at low pressure and high temperature.

# Ideal Gas Equation in Terms of Boltzmann Constant

From ideal gas equation:

$$
P V=n R T
$$

A mole can be defined as the number of atoms or molecules per unit Avogadro's number ( $N_{A}=6.02 \times 10^{20}$ ).

## Mathematically;

$$
n=\frac{N}{N_{A}}
$$

(ii) , N is number of atoms or molecules

Substituting Eq. (ii) in Eq. (i), we have

$$
P V=\frac{N}{N_{A}} R T
$$

The term $\frac{R}{N_{A}}$ is termed as Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$, i.e.,

$$
k_{B}=\frac{R}{N_{A}}
$$

(6.2)

For your information
Real gases approach ideal beheviour under:
(i) low pressure
(ii) high temperature

Substituting the values of $R$ and $N_{A}$ we have

$$
k_{B}=1.38 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~J} \cdot \mathrm{~K}^{-1}
$$

Substituting Eq. (6.2) in Eq. (iii),

$$
P V=N k_{B} T
$$

Equation (6.3) gives ideal gas equation in terms of Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$.
(1) Example 6.1 One mole of an ideal gas is at a temperature of 300 K . If the Boltzmann constant is $1.38 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$, calculate the volume of the gas at a pressure of 1 atom. [1atm $=101325 \mathrm{~Pa}]$
Solution We know that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P V=n R T \\
& R=N_{A} \times k_{B} \quad \text { where } k_{B}=\frac{R}{N_{A}} \\
& \text { Here } \quad V=\frac{n N_{A} k_{B} T}{P} \\
& \begin{array}{l}
V=\frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \times 6.02 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \times 300 \mathrm{~K}}{101325 \mathrm{~Pa}} \\
V \approx 0.0245 \mathrm{~m}^{3}
\end{array}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, volume of gas would be $0.0245 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$.

# Gas Laws

There are some variables (state functions) which describe quantity of gas which includes pressure, volume, and temperature ( $P, V$, and $T$ ) with change in one variable, the second variable changes while the third is kept constant. The laws that relate these variables mutually for an ideal gas are termed as gas laws.

## Boyle's Law

This law was introduced by Robert Boyle in 1662, and it provides a relationship between pressure and volume of a gas at constant temperature. It sates that for a fixed mass of an ideal gas, the pressure $P$ exerted by a gas varies inversely with volume $V$ occupied by the gas at constant temperature.
Mathematically;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P \propto \frac{1}{V} \text { at constant } T \\
& P=\text { constant } \frac{1}{V} \text { or } P V=\text { constant }
\end{aligned}
$$

or $\quad P_{1} V_{1}=P_{2} V_{2}$
Graphical representation of Boyle's law is shown in Fig. 6.1.

## Charles' Law

Charles' law relates volume and temperature of an ideal gas for a fixed mass at constant pressure. This law was formulated in 1870 by a French Physicist Jacques Charles. It states that the volume of given mass of gas at constant pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.
Mathematically;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V \propto T \text { atconstant } P \\
& V \\
& T=\text { constant } \\
& \text { or } \\
& \frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Graphically, it can be shown in Fig. 6.2.

## Joseph lussac's Law

Fig. 6.2

It states that for a fixed mass of an ideal gas, the pressure exerted by a gas varies directly with absolute temperature of the gas at constant volume.
Mathematically;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P \propto T \text { at constant } V \\
& P=\text { constant } \times T
\end{aligned}
$$

# Thermal Equilibrium

When two bodies are at the same temperature, the thermal energy (which is related to the kinetic energy of particles) of each body is equal. As a result, there is no driving force for heat transfer between them, and thus they remain in thermal equilibrium.

## Example

When we put a metal spoon into a hot cup of coffee:
(i) initially, the coffee is hotter than the spoon.
(ii) over time, heat flows from the coffee to the spoon.
(iii) eventually, the coffee and spoon reach at the same temperature.

Thermal equilibrium is achieved at this point, there is no net heat flow between the coffee and the spoon, and they are said to be in thermal equilibrium.

### 6.2 INTERNALENERGY

The sum of all forms of molecular energies (kinetic and potential) of a substance is termed as its internal energy. In the study of thermodynamics, usually ideal gas is considered as a working substance. The molecules of an ideal gas are mere mass points which exert no forces on one another. So, the internal energy of an ideal gas system is generally the translational $K . E$. of its molecules. Since the temperature of a system is defined as the average $K . E$ of its molecules, thus for an ideal gas system, the internal energy is directly proportional to its temperature.
According to the kinetic theory of gases, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is given by
$\langle K . E\rangle=\frac{3}{2} k_{a} T$ or $\left\langle\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}\right\rangle=\frac{3}{2} k_{a} T$
where $k_{a}$ is Boltzmann constant.
Therefore, the rise in temperature of an object reflects an increase in the internal kinetic energy of its particles. This increase in internal energy can
Different processes can lead to changes in internal energy and temperature, such as heating (adding heat), adiabatic compression or expansion (no heat exchange), or phase changes (where heat energy changes the state of matter without changing temperature).

occur due to the absorption of heat energy, which raises the average kinetic energy of the particles and thus increases the temperature of the object.

### 6.3 HEAT AND WORK

We know that both heat and work correspond to transfer of energy by some means. The idea was first applied to the steam engine where it was natural to transfer heat in and get work out. Consequently, it made a sense to define both heat in and work out as positive quantities. Hence, work done by the system on its environment is considered positive while work done on the system by the environment is taken as negative. If an amount of heat $Q$ enters the system, it could manifest itself as either an increase in internal energy or as a resulting quantity of work performed by the system on the surrounding or both.
We can express the work in terms of directly measurable variables. Consider the gas enclosed in the cylinder with a moveable, frictionless piston of cross-sectional area $A$ as shown in Fig.6.4(a). In equilibrium, the system occupies volume $V$ and exerts a pressure $P$ on the walls of the cylinder and its piston. The force $F$ exerted by the gas on the piston is $P A$.
We assume that the gas expands through $\Delta V$ very slowly, so that it remains in equilibrium as shown in Fig. 6.4(b). As the piston moves up through a small distance $\Delta y$, the work $W$ done by the gas is:
The work done can also be calculated by area of the curve under $P-V$ graph as shown in Fig. 6.5.

## Chapter 6. Heat and Thermodynamics

Intramal energy is a function of state. Consequently, it does not depend on path but depends on initial and final states of the system. Thus, internal energy is similar to the gravitational P.E. So, like the potential energy, it is the change in internal energy and not its absolute value, which is important.
Fig. 6.4
A gas is sealed in a cylinder by a weightless, frictioneless piston. The constant downward applied force $F$ equals $P A$, and when the piston is displaced, downward work is done on the gas.
Knowing the details of the change in internal energy and the mechanical work done, we are in a position to describe the general principles which deal with heat energy and its transformation into mechanical energy. These principles are known as laws of thermodynamics.

# 6.4 FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

When heat is added to a system there is an increase in the internal energy due to the rise in temperature, an increase in pressure or change in the state. If at the same time, a substance is allowed to do work on its environment by expansion, the heat $Q$ required will be the heat necessary to change the internal energy of the substance from $U_{1}$ in the first state to $U_{2}$ in the second state plus the work $W$ done on the environment.
Thus $\quad Q=\left(U_{2}-U_{1}\right)+W$
or $\quad Q=\Delta U+W$
Thus the change in internal energy $\Delta U=U_{2}-U_{1}$ is defined as $Q-W$. Since it is the same for all processes concerning the state, the first law of thermodynamics, thus can be stated as,

In any thermodynamic process, when heat $Q$ is added to a system, this energy appears as an increase in the internal energy $\Delta U$ stored in the system plus the work $W$ done by the system on its surroundings.

1. Conservation Principle: The underlying principle of the first law of thermodynamics is the conservation of energy. It asserts that while energy can change from one form to another (such as from chemical potential energy to thermal energy), the total energy in an isolated system remains constant over time.
2. Wider Applicability: Beyond mechanical systems, the first law of thermodynamics applies universally to all forms of energy and all types of processes, including chemical reactions, electrical systems, and nuclear reactions. It provides a foundational understanding that allows scientists and engineers to predict and understand energy transformations in various contexts.
The first law of thermodynamics expresses the law of conservation of energy by affirming that energy is a conserved quantity in isolated systems. It provides a framework to understand how energy is transferred and transformed within systems without violating the fundamental principle that energy neither be created nor be destroyed.
A bicycle pump is a good example of first law of thermodynamics. When we pump on the handle rapidly, it becomes hot due to mechanical work done on the gas, raising thereby its internal energy. One such simple arrangement is shown in Fig. 6.6. It consists of a bicycle pump with a blocked outlet.
Fig. 6.6

A thermocouple connected through the blocked outlet allows the air temperature to be monitored. Thermocouple thermometer can detect a minute variation of the temperature. When the piston is rapidly pushed, thermometer shows a temperature rise due to increase of internal energy of the air. The push force does work on the air, thereby, increasing its internal energy, which is shown, by the increase in temperature of the air.
Human metabolism also provides an example of energy conservation. Human beings and other animals do work when they walk, run, or move. Work requires energy. Energy is also needed for growth to make new cells and to replace old cells that have died. Energy transforming processes that occur within an organism are named as metabolism. We can apply the first law of thermodynamics ( $\Delta U=Q-W$ ), to an organism of the human body. Work done will result in the decrease in internal energy of the body. Consequently, the body temperature or in other words internal energy is maintained by the food we eat.

Example 6.2 A gas is enclosed in a container fitted with a piston of cross-sectional area $0.10 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The pressure of the gas is maintained at $8000 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{\infty}$. When heat is slowly transferred, the piston is pushed up through a distance of 4.0 cm . If 42 J heat is transferred to the system during the expansion, what is the change in internal energy of the system?

Solution The work done by the gas is

$$
\begin{aligned}
W=P \Delta V=P A \Delta y & =8000 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{-2} \times 0.10 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \times 4.0 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m} \\
& =32 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}=32 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

The change in internal energy is found from first law of thermodynamics

$$
\Delta U=Q-W=42 \mathrm{~J}-32 \mathrm{~J}=10 \mathrm{~J}
$$

# Isothermal Process

It is a process which is carried out at constant temperature and hence the condition for the application of Boyle's law on the gas is fulfilled. Therefore, when gas expands or compresses isothermally, the product of its pressure and volume during the process remains constant. If $P_{1}, V_{1}$ are initial pressure and volume whereas $P_{2}, V_{2}$ are pressure and volume after the isothermal change takes place (Fig. 6.7-a), respectively, then

$$
P_{1} V_{1}=P_{2} V_{2}
$$

In case of an ideal gas, the P.E. associated with its molecules is zero, hence, the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, which in this case remains constant, therefore, $\Delta U=0$. Hence, the first law of thermodynamics reduces to

$$
Q=W
$$

Thus if gas expands and does external work $W$, an amount of heat $Q$ has to be supplied to the gas in order to produce an isothermal change. Since transfer of heat from one

place to another requires time, hence, to keep the temperature of the gas constant, the expansion or compression must take place slowly. The curve representing an isothermal process is called an isotherm (Fig. 6.7-a).

# Adiabatic Process

An adiabatic process is the one in which no heat enters or leaves the system. Therefore, $\Delta Q=0$ and the first law of thermodynamics gives:

$$
W=-\Delta U
$$

## Brain teacert

Why does the intemal energy of an ideal gas remain constant during isothermal expansion?

Thus, if the gas expands and does external work, it is done at the expense of the internal energy of its molecules and, hence, the temperature of the gas falls. Conversely, an adiabatic compression causes the temperature of the gas to rise becalue of the work done on the gas.
Adiabatic change occurs when the gas expands or comprased rapidly, particularly when the gas is contained in an insulated cylinder. The examples of adiabatic process are:
(i) The rapid escape of air from a burst tyre.
(ii) The rapid expansion and compression of air through which a sound wave is passing.
(iii) Cloud formation in the atmosphere.

As the temperature of the gas does not remain constant, so it has been seen that;

$$
P V^{\prime}=\text { constant }
$$

where $\gamma$ is the ratio of the molar specific heat of the gas at constant pressure to molar specific heat at constant volume ( $\gamma=\frac{C_{v}}{C_{v}}$ ). The curve representing an adiabatic process is called an adiabat (Fig.6.7-b).

### 6.5 REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE PROCESSES

A reversible process is one which can be retraced in exactly reverse order, without producing any change in the surroundings. In the reverse process, the working substance passes through the same stages as in the direct process but thermal and mechanical effects at each stage are exactly reversed. If heat is absorbed in the direct process, it will be given out in the reverse process and if work is done by the substance in the direct process, work will be done on the substance in the reverse process. Hence, the working substance is restored to its original conditions.

A succession of events which brings the system back to its initial condition is called a cycle. A reversible cycle is the one in which all the changes are reversible.

Although no actual change is completely reversible but the processes of liquification and evaporation of a substance, performed slowly, are practically reversible. Similarly the

slow compression of a gas in a cylinder is reversible process as the compression can be changed to expansion by slowly decreasing the pressure on the piston to reverse the operation.

If a process cannot be retraced in the backward direction by reversing the controlling factors, it is an irreversible process.
All changes which occur suddenly or which involve friction or dissipation of energy through conduction, convection or radiation are irreversible. An example of highly irreversible process is an explosion.

# 6.6 HEAT ENGINE

A heat engine converts some thermal energy to mechanical work. Usually, the heat comes from the burning of a fuel. The earliest heat engine was the steam engine. It was developed on the fact that when water is boiled in a vessel covered with a lid, the steam inside tries to push the lid off showing the ability to do work. This observation helped to develop a steam engine.
The working principle of a heat engine is based on the conversion of heat energy into mechanical work through a cyclic process. Here is how a heat engine typically operates. The working principle of a heat engine involves the cyclic transfer of heat energy from a high temperature reservoir to a low temperature reservoir, with the objective of converting as much heat as possible into mechanical work. This process is governed by principles of thermodynamics and is essential in various applications where mechanical energy is required from heat sources.

### 6.7 SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

First law of thermodynamics tells us that heat energy can be converted into equivalent amount of work, but it is silent about the conditions under which this conversion takes place. The second law is concerned with the circumstances in which heat can be converted into work and direction of flow of heat.
Before initiating the discussion on formal statement of the second law of thermodynamics, let us analyze briefly the factual operation of an engine. The engine or the system (Fig. 6.8) absorbs a quantity of heat $Q_{1}$ from the heat source at temperature $T_{1}$. It does work $W$ and expels heat $Q_{2}$ to low temperature reservoir at temperature $T_{3}$. As the
Fig. 6.8
Schematic representation of a heat engine. The engine absorbs heat $Q_{1}$ from the hot reservoir, expels heat $Q_{1}$ to the cold reservoir and does work $W$.

working substance goes through a cyclic process, in which the substance eventually returns to its initial state, the change in internal energy is zero. Hence, from the first law of thermodynamics, net work done should be equal to the net heat absorbed, i.e.,

$$
W=Q_{1}-Q_{2}
$$

In practice, the petrol engine of a motor car extracts heat from the burning fuel and converts a part of this energy to mechanical energy or work and expels the rest to the atmosphere. It has been observed that petrol engines convert roughly $25 \%$ and diesel engines 35 to $40 \%$ available heat energy into work.
The second law of thermodynamics is a formal statement based on these observations. It can be stated in a number of different ways:
According to Lord Kelvin's statement based on the working of a heat engine:
It is impossible to devise a process which may convert heat, extracted from a single reservoir, entirely into work without leaving any change in the working system.
This means that a single heat reservoir, no matter how much energy it contains, cannot be made to perform any work. This is true for oceans and our atmosphere which contain a large amount of heat energy but cannot be converted into useful mechanical work. As a consequence of second law of thermodynamics, two bodies at different temperatures are essential for the conversion of heat into work. Hence, for the working of heat engine there must be a source of heat at a high temperature and a sink at low temperature to which heat may be expelled. The reason for our inability to utilize the heat contents of oceans and atmosphere is that there is no reservoir at a temperature lower than any one of the two.
According to the Kelvin statement of the second law of thermodynamics, the process pictured here is impossible. Heat from a source at a single temperature cannot be converted entirely into work.

# 6.8 GARNOT ENGINE AND CARNOT'S THEOREM

Sadi Carnot in 1824 described an ideal engine using only isothermal and adiabatic processes. He showed that a heat engine operating in an ideal reversible cycle between two heat reservoirs at different temperatures, would be the most efficient engine. A Carnot cycle using an ideal gas as the working substance is shown on PV diagram (Fig. 6.9). It consists of following four steps:

1. The gas is allowed to expand isothermally at temperature $T_{1}$ absorbing heat $Q_{1}$ from the hot
Fig. 6.9

reservoir. The process is represented by the curve $A B$.
2. The gas is then allowed to expand adiabatically until its temperature drops to $T_{2}$. The process is represented by the curve $B C$.
3. The gas at this stage is compressed isothermally at temperature $T_{2}$ rejecting heat $Q_{2}$ to the cold reservoir. The process is represented by the curve CD.
4. Finally the gas is compressed adiabatically to restore its initial state at temperature $T_{1}$. The process is represented by the curve DA.
Thermal and mechanical equilibrium is maintained all the time so that each process is perfectly reversible. As the working substance returns to the initial state, there is no change in its internal energy i.e., $\Delta U=0$.
The net work done during one cycle equals to the area enclosed by the path $A B C D A$ of the $P V$ diagram. It can also be estimated from net heat $\Delta Q$ absorbed in one cycle.

$$
Q=Q_{1}-Q_{2}
$$

From $1^{\text {st }}$ law of thermodynamics:

$$
Q=\Delta U+W
$$

or

$$
W=Q_{1}-Q_{2} \quad(\therefore \Delta U=0)
$$

The efficiency $\eta$ of the heat engine is defined as:

$$
\eta=\frac{\text { Output (Work) }}{\text { Input (Energy) }}
$$

Thus

$$
\eta=\frac{Q_{1}-Q_{2}}{Q_{1}}
$$

The energy transfer in an isothermal expansion or compression turns out to be proportional to kelvin temperature. So $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are proportional to kelvin temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ respectively and hence,

$$
\eta=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}}=1-\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}
$$

The efficiency is usually taken in percentage, in that case:
Percentage efficiency $=\left(1-\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\right) \times 100$
Thus, the efficiency of Carnot engine depends on the temperature of hot and cold reservoirs. It is independent of the nature of working substance. The larger the temperature difference of two reservoirs, the greater is the efficiency. But it can never be one or $100 \%$ unless cold reservoir is at absolute zero temperature ( $T_{2}=0 \mathrm{~K}$ ).
Such reservoirs are not available and hence the maximum efficiency is always less than

one. Nevertheless, the Carnot cycle establishes an upper limit on the efficiency of all heat engines. No practical heat engine can be perfectly reversible and also energy dissipation is inevitable. This fact is stated in Camot's theorem:

No heat engine can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same two temperatures.

The Carnot's theorem can be extended to state that:
All Carnot's engines operating between the same two temperatures have the same efficiency, irrespective of the nature of working substance.
In most practical cases, the cold reservoir is near room temperature. So, the efficiency can only be increased by raising the temperature of hot reservoir. All real heat engines are less efficient than Carnot engine due to friction and other heat losses.

Example 6.3 The turbine in a steam power plant takes steam from a boiler at $427^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and exhausts into a low temperature reservoir at $77^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. What is the maximum possible efficiency?

Solution Maximum efficiency for any engine operating between temperatures $T$ and $T_{2}$ is

$$
\% \eta=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}} \times 100 \% \quad \text { where } \quad T_{1}=427+273=700 \mathrm{~K}
$$

and

$$
T_{2}=77+273=350 \mathrm{~K}
$$

so

$$
\eta=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}}=\frac{700 \mathrm{~K}-350 \mathrm{~K}}{700 \mathrm{~K}}=\frac{350 \mathrm{~K}}{700 \mathrm{~K}}=\frac{1}{2}=0.5 \quad \text { or } \% \eta=0.5 \times 100=50 \%
$$

# 6.9 REFRIGERATOR

Refrigerator is a device which maintains the temperature of a body below that of its surrounding. It operates in a cyclic process but in reverse as that of the heat engine as shown in Fig.6.10. A refrigerator absorbs heat from a cold reservoir and gives it off to a hot reservoir. This shows that in a refrigerator, the work is done on the system while in a heat engine work is done by the system.
A refrigerator works on the basis of Clausius statement of second law of thermodynamics, i.e., a heat engine is operating in reverse. Heat $Q_{0}$ is drawn from Low Temperature Reservoir (LTR) $T_{1}$ by compressor and is thrown into High Temperature Reservoir (HTR) $T_{2}$ with the help of external work done. The heat rejected to HTR $\left(Q_{u}\right)$ is given by
Fig. 6.10
A refrigerator transfers heat from a low-temperature compartment to higher-temperature surroundings with the help of external work. It is a heat engine operating in reverse order.

$$
Q_{c}+W=Q_{N} \text { or } W=Q_{N}-Q_{c}
$$

The main purpose of refrigerator is to extract as much heat $Q_{c}$ as possible from LTR with the expenditure of as little work Was possible.

# Coefficient of Performance of Refrigerator

The ratio of heat removed from LTR $\left(Q_{c}\right)$ to the work done $(W)$ is called coefficient of performance of a refrigerator.
A better refrigerator will remove a greater amount of heat from inside the refrigerator for the expenditure of a smaller mechanical work or electrical energy. The coefficient of performance of a refrigerator can be given by

$$
E=\frac{Q_{c}}{W}=\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{1}-Q_{c}}
$$

The coefficient of performance in terms of temperature, where $Q \neq T$ is:

$$
E=\frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}-T_{1}}
$$

## Example 6.4

A refrigerator has a coefficient of performance $\beta$. If temperature in the freezer is $-23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, then what is the temperature at which it rejects the heat?

## Solution

Coefficient of performance

$$
E=8
$$

Temperature of cold reservoir (freezer) $T_{1}=-23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=-23+273=250 \mathrm{~K}$
Temperature of hotreservoir (room) $T_{c}=$ ?
Coefficient of performance

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}-T_{1}} \\
& 8=\frac{250 \mathrm{~K}}{T_{2}-250 \mathrm{~K}} \\
& 8\left(T_{c}-250 \mathrm{~K}\right)=250 \mathrm{~K} \text { or } \quad T_{2}-250 \mathrm{~K}=\frac{250 \mathrm{~K}}{8} \\
& T_{2}=31.25 \mathrm{~K}+250 \mathrm{~K}=281.25 \mathrm{~K}=8.25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\end{aligned}

### 6.10 ENTROPY

The concept of entropy was introduced into the study of thermodynamics by Rudolph Clausius in 1856 to give a quantitative basis for the second law. It provides another variable to describe the state of a system to go along with pressure, volume, temperature and internal energy. If a system undergoes a reversible process during which itabsorbs a quantity of heat $\Delta Q$ at absolute temperature $T$, then the increase in the state variable called entropy $S$ of the system is given by

$$
\Delta S=\frac{\Delta Q}{T}
$$

Like potential energy or internal energy, it is the change in entropy of the system which is important.
The change in entropy is positive when heat is added and negative when heat is removed from the system. Suppose an amount of heat $Q$ flows from a reservoir at temperature $T_{1}$ through a conducting rod to a reservoir at temperature $T_{2}$ when $T_{1}>T_{2}$. The change in entropy of the reservoir, at temperature $T_{1}$, which loses heat, decreases by $Q / T_{1}$ and of the reservoir at temperature $T_{2}$, which gains heat, increases by $Q / T_{2}$. As $T_{1}>T_{2}$, so $Q / T_{2}$ will be greater than $Q / T_{1}$, i.e. $Q / T_{2}>Q / T_{1}$.
Hence, net change in entropy $\left(\frac{Q}{T_{2}}-\frac{Q}{T_{1}}\right)$ is positive.
It follows that in all natural processes where heat flows from one system to another, there is always a net increase in entropy. This is another statement of $2^{\text {nd }}$ law of thermodynamics. It states that;

If a system undergoes a natural process, it will go in the direction that causes the entropy of the system plus the environment to increase.
It is observed that a natural process tends to proceed towards a state of greater disorder. Thus, there is a relation between entropy and molecular disorder. For example, an irreversible heat flow from a hot to a cold substance of a system increases disorder because the molecules are initially sorted out in hotter and cooler regions. This order is lost when the system comes to thermal equilibrium. Addition of heat to a system increases its disorder because of increase in average molecular speeds and therefore, the randomness of molecular motion. Similarly, free expansion of gas increases its disorder because the molecules have greater randomness of position after expansion than before. Thus, in both examples, entropy is said to be increased.
We can conclude that only those processes are probable for which entropy of the system increases or remains constant. The process for which entropy remains constant is a reversible process; whereas for all irreversible processes, entropy of the system increases.
Every time entropy increases, the opportunity to convert some heat into work is lost. For example, there is an increase in entropy when hot and cold waters are mixed. Finally, the warm water cannot be separated into a hot layer and a cold layer. There has been no loss of energy but some of the energy is no longer available for conversion into work. Therefore, increase in entropy means degradation of energy from a higher level where more work can be extracted to a lower level at which less or no useful work can be done. The energy in a sense is degraded, going from more orderly form to less orderly form, eventually ending up as thermal energy.
In all real processes where heat transfer occurs, the energy available for doing useful

work decreases, eventually, the entropy increases. Even if the temperature of some system decreases, thereby decreasing the entropy, it is at the expense of net increase in entropy for some other system. When all the systems are taken together as the universe, the entropy of the universe always increases.

Example 6.5 Calculate the entropy change when 1.0 kg ice at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ melts into water at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Latent heat of fusion of ice $L_{f}=3.36 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~kg}^{-1}$.

Solution $m=1 \mathrm{~kg}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
T & =0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=273 \mathrm{~K} \\
L_{f} & =3.36 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~kg}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

As

$$
\Delta S=\frac{\Delta Q}{T}
$$

where

$$
\Delta Q=m L_{f}
$$

So

$$
\Delta S=\frac{m L_{f}}{T}
$$

Substituting the values

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta S=\frac{1.00 \mathrm{~kg} \times 3.36 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~kg}}{273 \mathrm{~K}} \\
& \Delta S=1.23 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, entropy increases as it changes to water. The increase in entropy in this case is a measure of increase in the disorder of water molecules that change from solid to liquid state.
