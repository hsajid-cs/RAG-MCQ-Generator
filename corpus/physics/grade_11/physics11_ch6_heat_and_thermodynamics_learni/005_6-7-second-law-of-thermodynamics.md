### 6.7 SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

First law of thermodynamics tells us that heat energy can be converted into equivalent amount of work, but it is silent about the conditions under which this conversion takes place. The second law is concerned with the circumstances in which heat can be converted into work and direction of flow of heat.
Before initiating the discussion on formal statement of the second law of thermodynamics, let us analyze briefly the factual operation of an engine. The engine or the system (Fig. 6.8) absorbs a quantity of heat $Q_{1}$ from the heat source at temperature $T_{1}$. It does work $W$ and expels heat $Q_{2}$ to low temperature reservoir at temperature $T_{3}$. As the

working substance goes through a cyclic process, in which the substance eventually returns to its initial state, the change in internal energy is zero. Hence, from the first law of thermodynamics, net work done should be equal to the net heat absorbed, i.e.,

$$
W=Q_{1}-Q_{2}
$$

In practice, the petrol engine of a motor car extracts heat from the burning fuel and converts a part of this energy to mechanical energy or work and expels the rest to the atmosphere. It has been observed that petrol engines convert roughly $25 \%$ and diesel engines 35 to $40 \%$ available heat energy into work.
The second law of thermodynamics is a formal statement based on these observations. It can be stated in a number of different ways:
According to Lord Kelvin's statement based on the working of a heat engine:
It is impossible to devise a process which may convert heat, extracted from a single reservoir, entirely into work without leaving any change in the working system.
This means that a single heat reservoir, no matter how much energy it contains, cannot be made to perform any work. This is true for oceans and our atmosphere which contain a large amount of heat energy but cannot be converted into useful mechanical work. As a consequence of second law of thermodynamics, two bodies at different temperatures are essential for the conversion of heat into work. Hence, for the working of heat engine there must be a source of heat at a high temperature and a sink at low temperature to which heat may be expelled. The reason for our inability to utilize the heat contents of oceans and atmosphere is that there is no reservoir at a temperature lower than any one of the two.
According to the Kelvin statement of the second law of thermodynamics, the process pictured here is impossible. Heat from a source at a single temperature cannot be converted entirely into work.

# 6.8 GARNOT ENGINE AND CARNOT'S THEOREM

Sadi Carnot in 1824 described an ideal engine using only isothermal and adiabatic processes. He showed that a heat engine operating in an ideal reversible cycle between two heat reservoirs at different temperatures, would be the most efficient engine. A Carnot cycle using an ideal gas as the working substance is shown on PV diagram (Fig. 6.9). It consists of following four steps:

1. The gas is allowed to expand isothermally at temperature $T_{1}$ absorbing heat $Q_{1}$ from the hot
Fig. 6.9

reservoir. The process is represented by the curve $A B$.
2. The gas is then allowed to expand adiabatically until its temperature drops to $T_{2}$. The process is represented by the curve $B C$.
3. The gas at this stage is compressed isothermally at temperature $T_{2}$ rejecting heat $Q_{2}$ to the cold reservoir. The process is represented by the curve CD.
4. Finally the gas is compressed adiabatically to restore its initial state at temperature $T_{1}$. The process is represented by the curve DA.
Thermal and mechanical equilibrium is maintained all the time so that each process is perfectly reversible. As the working substance returns to the initial state, there is no change in its internal energy i.e., $\Delta U=0$.
The net work done during one cycle equals to the area enclosed by the path $A B C D A$ of the $P V$ diagram. It can also be estimated from net heat $\Delta Q$ absorbed in one cycle.

$$
Q=Q_{1}-Q_{2}
$$

From $1^{\text {st }}$ law of thermodynamics:

$$
Q=\Delta U+W
$$

or

$$
W=Q_{1}-Q_{2} \quad(\therefore \Delta U=0)
$$

The efficiency $\eta$ of the heat engine is defined as:

$$
\eta=\frac{\text { Output (Work) }}{\text { Input (Energy) }}
$$

Thus

$$
\eta=\frac{Q_{1}-Q_{2}}{Q_{1}}
$$

The energy transfer in an isothermal expansion or compression turns out to be proportional to kelvin temperature. So $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are proportional to kelvin temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ respectively and hence,

$$
\eta=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}}=1-\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}
$$

The efficiency is usually taken in percentage, in that case:
Percentage efficiency $=\left(1-\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\right) \times 100$
Thus, the efficiency of Carnot engine depends on the temperature of hot and cold reservoirs. It is independent of the nature of working substance. The larger the temperature difference of two reservoirs, the greater is the efficiency. But it can never be one or $100 \%$ unless cold reservoir is at absolute zero temperature ( $T_{2}=0 \mathrm{~K}$ ).
Such reservoirs are not available and hence the maximum efficiency is always less than

one. Nevertheless, the Carnot cycle establishes an upper limit on the efficiency of all heat engines. No practical heat engine can be perfectly reversible and also energy dissipation is inevitable. This fact is stated in Camot's theorem:

No heat engine can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same two temperatures.

The Carnot's theorem can be extended to state that:
All Carnot's engines operating between the same two temperatures have the same efficiency, irrespective of the nature of working substance.
In most practical cases, the cold reservoir is near room temperature. So, the efficiency can only be increased by raising the temperature of hot reservoir. All real heat engines are less efficient than Carnot engine due to friction and other heat losses.

Example 6.3 The turbine in a steam power plant takes steam from a boiler at $427^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and exhausts into a low temperature reservoir at $77^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. What is the maximum possible efficiency?

Solution Maximum efficiency for any engine operating between temperatures $T$ and $T_{2}$ is

$$
\% \eta=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}} \times 100 \% \quad \text { where } \quad T_{1}=427+273=700 \mathrm{~K}
$$

and

$$
T_{2}=77+273=350 \mathrm{~K}
$$

so

$$
\eta=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}}=\frac{700 \mathrm{~K}-350 \mathrm{~K}}{700 \mathrm{~K}}=\frac{350 \mathrm{~K}}{700 \mathrm{~K}}=\frac{1}{2}=0.5 \quad \text { or } \% \eta=0.5 \times 100=50 \%
$$

# 6.9 REFRIGERATOR

Refrigerator is a device which maintains the temperature of a body below that of its surrounding. It operates in a cyclic process but in reverse as that of the heat engine as shown in Fig.6.10. A refrigerator absorbs heat from a cold reservoir and gives it off to a hot reservoir. This shows that in a refrigerator, the work is done on the system while in a heat engine work is done by the system.
A refrigerator works on the basis of Clausius statement of second law of thermodynamics, i.e., a heat engine is operating in reverse. Heat $Q_{0}$ is drawn from Low Temperature Reservoir (LTR) $T_{1}$ by compressor and is thrown into High Temperature Reservoir (HTR) $T_{2}$ with the help of external work done. The heat rejected to HTR $\left(Q_{u}\right)$ is given by
Fig. 6.10
A refrigerator transfers heat from a low-temperature compartment to higher-temperature surroundings with the help of external work. It is a heat engine operating in reverse order.

$$
Q_{c}+W=Q_{N} \text { or } W=Q_{N}-Q_{c}
$$

The main purpose of refrigerator is to extract as much heat $Q_{c}$ as possible from LTR with the expenditure of as little work Was possible.

# Coefficient of Performance of Refrigerator

The ratio of heat removed from LTR $\left(Q_{c}\right)$ to the work done $(W)$ is called coefficient of performance of a refrigerator.
A better refrigerator will remove a greater amount of heat from inside the refrigerator for the expenditure of a smaller mechanical work or electrical energy. The coefficient of performance of a refrigerator can be given by

$$
E=\frac{Q_{c}}{W}=\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{1}-Q_{c}}
$$

The coefficient of performance in terms of temperature, where $Q \neq T$ is:

$$
E=\frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}-T_{1}}
$$

## Example 6.4

A refrigerator has a coefficient of performance $\beta$. If temperature in the freezer is $-23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, then what is the temperature at which it rejects the heat?

## Solution

Coefficient of performance

$$
E=8
$$

Temperature of cold reservoir (freezer) $T_{1}=-23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=-23+273=250 \mathrm{~K}$
Temperature of hotreservoir (room) $T_{c}=$ ?
Coefficient of performance

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}-T_{1}} \\
& 8=\frac{250 \mathrm{~K}}{T_{2}-250 \mathrm{~K}} \\
& 8\left(T_{c}-250 \mathrm{~K}\right)=250 \mathrm{~K} \text { or } \quad T_{2}-250 \mathrm{~K}=\frac{250 \mathrm{~K}}{8} \\
& T_{2}=31.25 \mathrm{~K}+250 \mathrm{~K}=281.25 \mathrm{~K}=8.25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\end{aligned}
$$
