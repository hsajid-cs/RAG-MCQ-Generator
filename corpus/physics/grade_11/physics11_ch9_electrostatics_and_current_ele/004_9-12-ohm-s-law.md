### 9.12 OHM'S LAW

When a potential difference $V$ is applied across the ends of a conductor, a current / starts flowing through it. The Ohm'slaw states that:

The current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference applied across the conductor, provided there is no charge in the physical state of the conductor.
Mathematically,

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
& I \propto V & \text { or } \quad V \propto I \\
\text { or } & V=I R & (9.34)
\end{array}
$$

where $R$ is a constant of proportionality known as resistance of the conductor. The SI unit of resistance is ohm denoted by the Greek capital letter omega ( $\Omega$ ), and is defined as:

The resistance of a conductor is 1 ohm if a current of 1 ampere flows through it when a potential difference of 1 volt is applied across its ends.
