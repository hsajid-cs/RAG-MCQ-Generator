### 9.13 RESISTIVITY AND ITS DEPENDENCE UPON TEMPERATURE

It has been experimentally seen that the resistance $R$ of a wire is directly proportional to

its length $L$ and inversely proportional to its cross sectional area $A$. Mathematically,

$$
R \propto \frac{L}{A}
$$

$$
R=\rho \frac{L}{A}
$$

where $p$ (rho) is a constant of proportionality known as resistivity or specific resistance of the material of the wire. It may be noted that resistance is the characteristic of a particular wire whereas the resistivity is the property of the material of which the wire is made. From Eq. 9.35, we have

$$
\rho=\frac{R A}{L}
$$

The above equation gives the definition of resistivity as the resistance of a metre cube of a material. The SI unit of resistivity is ohm-metre ( $\Omega \mathrm{m}$ )
Conductance is another quantity used to describe the electrical properties of materials. In fact, conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, i.e.

$$
\text { Conductance }=\frac{1}{\text { Resistance }}, G=\frac{1}{R}, G \text { is the conductance. }
$$

Mathematically, conductivity, $\sigma$ (sigma) is the reciprocal of resistivity ( $\rho$ ), i.e.

$$
\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}
$$

The SI unit of conductivity is ohm " $m$ " or mho m". Resistivity of various materials is given in Table 9.2. It may be noted from Table 9.2 that silver and copper are two best conductors. That is the reason, most of electric wires are made of copper.
The resistivity of a substance depends upon the temperature also. It can be explained by recalling that the resistance offered by a conductor to the flow of electric current is due to collisions, which the free electrons encounter with atoms of the lattice. As the temperature of the conductor rises, the amplitude of vibration of the atoms in the lattice increases and hence, the probability of their collision with free electrons also increases. One may say that the atoms then offer a bigger target, that is the collision cross-section of the atoms increases with temperature. This makes the collisions between free electrons and the atoms in the lattice more frequent and hence, the resistance of the conductor increases.

# Physica II

Experimentally, the change in resistance of a metallic conductor with temperature is found to be nearly linear over a considerable range of temperature above and below $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (Fig.9.23). Over such a range the fractional change in resistance per kelvin is known as the temperature coefficient ( $\alpha$ ) of resistance, i.e.

$$
\alpha=\frac{R_{i}-R_{0}}{R_{0} t}
$$

where $R_{0}$ and $R_{i}$ are resistances at temperatures $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $t^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ respectively. As resistivity $\rho$ depends upon the temperature, Eq. 9.35 gives

$$
R_{i}=\eta \frac{L}{A} \text { and } R_{0}=\eta \frac{L}{A}
$$

Substituting the values of $R_{i}$ and $R_{0}$ in Eq. 9.39, we have

$$
\alpha=\frac{\eta-\rho_{0}}{\rho_{0} t}
$$

where $\rho_{0}$ is the resistivity of a conductor at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $\rho_{i}$ is the resistivity at $t^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Values of temperature coefficients of resistance of some substances are also listed in Table 9.2. There are some substances like germanium, silicon, etc. whose resistance decreases with increase in temperature, these substances have negative temperature coefficients.

## Inspectors can easily check the reliability of a concrete bridge made with carbon fibers. The fibers conduct electricity. If sensors show that electrical resistance is increasing over time the fibers are separating because of cracks.

Example 9.8 0.75 A current flows through an iron wire when a battery of 1.5 V is connected across its ends. The length of the wire is 5.0 m and its cross-sectional area is $2.5 \times 10^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Compute the resistivity of iron.

## Solution

The resistance $R$ of the wire can be calculated by Eq. 9.34 i.e.,

$$
R=\frac{V}{i}=\frac{1.5 \mathrm{~V}}{0.75 \mathrm{~A}}=2.0 \mathrm{VA}^{\prime}=2.0 \Omega
$$

The resistivity $\rho$ of iron of which the wire is made of is given by

$$
\rho=R \frac{A}{L}=\frac{2.0 \Omega \times 2.5 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{2}}{5.0 \mathrm{~m}}=1.0 \times 10^{-1} \Omega \mathrm{~m}
$$

Example 9.9 A platinum wire has resistance of $10 \Omega$ at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $20 \Omega$ at $193^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Find the value of temperature coefficient of resistance of platinum.

$$
R_{0}=10 \Omega, R_{i}=20 \Omega, t=466 \mathrm{~K}-273 \mathrm{~K}=193 \mathrm{~K}
$$

Temperature coefficient of resistance can be found by

$$
\alpha=\frac{R_{f}-R_{0}}{R_{0} t}=\frac{20 \Omega-10 \Omega}{10 \Omega \times 193 \mathrm{~K}}=\frac{1}{193 \mathrm{~K}}=5.18 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}
$$

# 9.14 ELECTRICAL POWER

Consider a circuit consisting of a battery of emf $\varepsilon$ connected in series with a resistance $R$ (Fig. 9.24). A steady current flows through the circuit and a steady potential difference $V$ exists between the terminals $A$ and $B$ of the resistor $R$. Terminal $A$, connected to the positive pole of the battery, is at a higher potential than the terminal B. In this circuit the battery is continuously lifting charge uphill through the potential difference $V$. Using the meaning of potential difference, the work done in moving a charge $Q$ up through the potential difference $V$ is given by

$$
\text { Work done }=W=V \times Q \text {. } \\
\text { This is the energy supplied by the battery. }
$$

The rate at which the battery is supplying electrical energy is the power output or electrical power of the battery. Using the definition of power, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Electrical power } & =\frac{\text { Energy supplied }}{\text { Time taken }}=V \frac{Q}{t} \\
\text { Since } \quad I & =\frac{Q}{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

The above equation can also be written as:
Fig. 9.24: The power of a battery appears as the power dissipated in the resistance $R$.

Electrical power $=V I$
Equation 9.42 is a general relation for power delivered from a source of current $I$ operating on a voltage $V$. In the circuit shown in Fig. 9.24 the power supplied by the battery is expended or dissipated in the resistor $R$. The principle of conservation of energy tells us that the power dissipated in the resistor is also given by Eq. 9.42.

Power dissipated $P=V I$
Alternative equation for calculating power can be found by substituting $V=I R, I=V / R$ in turn in Eq. 9.42.
or

$$
P=V I=(I R) I=I^{2} R
$$

$$
P=V I=V(V / R)=V^{2} / R
$$

Thus, we have three equations for calculating the power dissipated in a resistor.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P=V I, \quad P=I^{2} R \\
& P=V^{2} / R
\end{aligned}
$$

If $V$ Is expressed in volts and $I$ in amperes, the power is expressed in watts.
