### 9.3 ELECTRIC FLUX

When we place an element of area in an electric field, some of the lines of force pass through it (Fig. 9.11). The number of the field lines passing through a certain element of area is known as electric flux through that area. It is usually denoted by Greek letter $\phi_{0}$. For example, the electric flux $\phi_{0}$ through the area $A$ is 4 while the flux through B is 2 .
In order to give a quantitative meaning to flux, the field

lines are drawn such that the number of field lines passing through a unit area held perpendicular to field lines at a point represent the intensity $E$ of the field at that point.
Usually, the element of area is represented by a vector area $A$ whose magnitude is equal to the surface area $A$ of the element and direction is along normal to the area.
In Fig.9.12 (a), area $A$ is held perpendicular to the field lines, then EA lines pass through it. The flux $\phi_{n}$ in this case is:

$$
\phi_{n}=E A
$$

In Figure 9.12 (b), area $A$ is held parallel to field lines and, as is obvious no lines cross this area, so that flux $\phi_{n}$ in this case is:

$$
\phi_{n}=E A=0
$$

Figure 9.12(c) shows the case when $A$ is neither perpendicular nor parallel to field lines but is inclined at an angle $\theta$ with the field $E$. In this case, we have to find the projection of the area which is perpendicular to the field lines. The area of this projection (Fig. 9.12-c) is $A \cos \theta$. The flux $\phi_{n}$ in this case is:

$$
\phi_{n}=E A \cos \theta
$$

The electric flux $\phi_{n}$ through a patch of flat surface in terms of $E$ and $A$ is then given by

$$
\phi_{n}=E A \cos \theta=E \cdot A
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the field lines and the normal to the area. Electric flux being a scalar product, is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit is $\mathrm{Nm}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{4}$.

# Electric Flux Through a Surface Enclosing a Charge

Let us calculate the electric flux through a closed surface, in shape of a sphere of radius $r$ due to a point charge $q$ placed at the centre of sphere as shown in Fig. 9.13. To apply the formula $\phi_{n}=E . A$ for the computation of eleotric flux, the surface area should be flat. For this reason the total surface area of the
Fig.9.12(a): Maximum
Fig.9.12(b): Minimum
Fig.9.13: The total electric flux through the surface of the sphere due to a charge $q$ at its centre is $q \delta_{0}$.

sphere is divided into $n$ small patches with areas of magnitudes $\Delta A_{1}, \Delta A_{2}, \Delta A_{3}, \ldots \ldots$ $\Delta A_{n}$, respectively as shown in Fig. 9.13. The direction of each vector area is along perpendicular drawn outward to the corresponding patch. The electric intensities at the centres of vector areas $\Delta A_{1}, \Delta A_{2}, \Delta A_{3}, \ldots \ldots, \Delta A_{n}$ are $E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}, \ldots \ldots, E_{n}$ respectively.
According to Eq. 9.13, the total flux passing through the closed surface is:

$$
Q_{n}=E_{1} \cdot \Delta A_{1}+E_{2} \cdot \Delta A_{2}+E_{3} \cdot \Delta A_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+E_{n} \cdot \Delta A_{n}
$$

The direction of electric intensity and vector area is the same at each patch. Moreover,

$$
\left|E_{1}\right|=\left|E_{2}\right|=\left|E_{3}\right|=\ldots \ldots \ldots=\left|E_{n}=E=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{n}} \frac{q}{r^{2}}\right.
$$

Since $E$ is parallel to vector area $A_{1}$ therefore, $\theta=0^{\circ}$ (Fig. 9.13) so for each $E . \Delta A=E A \cos 0$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =E A \cos 0^{\circ}=E A \quad\left(\because \cos 0^{\circ}=1\right) \\
& \phi_{0}-E \Delta A_{1}+E \Delta A_{2}+E \Delta A_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+E \Delta A_{n} \\
& -E\left(\Delta A_{1}+\Delta A_{2}+\Delta A_{3}-\ldots \ldots+\Delta A_{n}\right) \\
& -E \text { (Total spherical surface area) } \\
& =\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{n}} \frac{q}{r^{2}} \times 4 \pi r^{2} \\
& \phi_{0}=\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{n}} \\
& \text { (9.16) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Now Imagine that a closed surface $S$ is enclosing this sphere. It can be seen in Fig 9.14 that the flux through
Fig: 9.14
the closed surface $S$ is the same as that through the sphere. So, we can conclude that total flux through a closed surface does not depend upon the shape or geometry of the closed surface. It depends upon the medium and the charge enclosed.

# 9.4 GAUSS'S LAW

Suppose point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, \ldots \ldots, q_{n}$ are arbitrarily distributed within an arbitrarily shaped closed surface, as shown in Fig. 9.15. Since $\phi_{n}=q / \varepsilon_{n}$, so the electric flux passing through the closed surface is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \phi_{0}=\frac{q_{1}}{\varepsilon_{n}}\left|\frac{q_{2}}{\varepsilon_{n}}\right| \frac{q_{3}}{\varepsilon_{n}} \mid \ldots \ldots \cdot \frac{q_{n}}{\varepsilon_{n}} \\
& \phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n}} \times\left(q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+q_{n}\right) \\
& \phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n}} \times \text { (Total charge enclosed by closed surface) } \\
& \phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n}} \times Q
\end{aligned}
$$

Fig: 9.15

$$
\phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n}} \times Q
$$

where $Q=q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+q_{n}$ is the total charge enclosed by closed surface. Equation 9.17 is mathematical expression of Gauss's law which can be slated as:

The total electric flux through any closed surface is $1 / k_{0}$ times the total charge enclosed in it.

# Applications of Gauss's Law

Gauss's law can be applied to calculate the electric intensity due to different charge configurations. In all such cases, an imaginary closed surface is considered which passes through the point at which the electric intensity is to be evaluated. This closed surface is known as Gaussian surface. Its choice is such that the flux through it can be easily evaluated.
As an example, let us find the electric field at any point outside a sphere on which a charge $q$ is placed.

## The Field of a Charged Conducting Sphere

Consider a conducting sphere of radius $R$ containing a charge $q$. We know that all the charge is distributed uniformly over the surface of sphere as shown in Fig. 9.16. We can also conclude from the spherical symmetry that the electric field is radial everywhere and that its magnitude depends only on the distance $r$ from the centre of the sphere. Thus, the magnitude $E$ is uniform over a spherical surface with any radius $r$ concentric with the spherical conductor. Therefore, we take our Gaussian surface as an imaginary sphere with radius $r$ greater than the radius $R$ of the conducting sphere.
The area of the Gaussian sphere is $4 \pi r^{2}$, and because $E$ is uniform over the sphere, the total flux through the whole surface will be:
Electric flux

$$
\phi_{2}=E A=E \times 4 \pi r^{2}
$$

By Gauss's law, total flux is:

Therefore

$$
E \times 4 \pi r^{2}=\frac{q}{E}
$$

or

$$
E=\frac{q}{E_{1}} \frac{1}{4 \pi r^{2}}
$$

or

$$
E=\frac{1}{4 \pi E_{1}} \times \frac{q}{r^{2}}
$$

Fig: 9.16

This shows that the field at any point outside the sphere is the same as though the entire charge were concentrated at its centre. Just outside of the sphere, where $r=R$, i.e.,

$$
E=\frac{1}{4 \pi E_{1}} \frac{q}{R^{2}}
$$

In vector form;

$$
\mathbf{E}=\frac{1}{4 \pi E_{1}} \frac{q}{R^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the direction of $\mathbf{E}$.

# 9.5 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

Figure 9.17 shows two oppositely charged parallel plated which produce a uniform electric field.
Let us consider a positive charge $q$ which is allowed to move in this uniform electric field. The positive charge will move from plate $B$ to $A$ and will gain $K . E$. If it is to be moved from $A$ to $B$, an external force is needed to make the charge move against the electric field and will gain P.E. Let us impose a condition that as the charge is moved from $A$ to $B$, it is moved keeping electrostatic equilibrium, i.e., it moves with uniform velocity. This
Fig 9.17
condition could be achieved by applying a force $F$ equal and opposite to $q E$ at every point along its path. The work done by the external force against the electric field increases electrical potential energy of the charge that is moved.
Let $W_{\text {Aa }}$ be the work done by the force in carrying the positive charge $q$ from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium. The change in its potential energy $\Delta U=W_{\text {Aa }}$.
or $\quad U_{0}-U_{A}=W_{A B}$
where $U_{A}$ and $U_{0}$, are defined to be the potential energies at points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
To describe electric field, we introduce the idea of electric potential difference. The potential difference between two points $A$ and $B$ in an electric field is defined as the work done in carrying a unit positive charge from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium, i.e.,

$$
\Delta V=V_{B}-V_{A}=\frac{W_{A B}}{q}=\frac{\Delta U}{q}
$$

where $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ are defined as electric potentials at points $A$ and $B$ respectively. Electric potential energy difference and electric potential difference between the points $A$ and $B$ are related as:

$$
\Delta U=q \Delta V
$$

Thus, the potential difference between the two points can be defined as the difference of the potential energy per unit charge.
An ECG records the "voltage" between points on human skin generated by electrical process in the heart. This ECG is made in running position providing information about the heart's performance under stress.

As the unit of P.E. is joule, Eq. 9.20 shows that the unit of potential difference is joule per coulomb. It is called volt such that,

$$
1 \text { volt }=\frac{1 \text { joule }}{1 \text { coulomb }}
$$

That is, a potential difference of 1 volt exists between two points if work done in moving a 1 coulomb positive charge from one point to the other, keeping electrostatic equilibrium, is one joule.
In order to give a concept of electric potential at a point in an electric field, we must have a reference to which we assign zero electric potential. This point is usually taken at infinity. Thus, in Eq. 9.20, if we take point $A$ to be at infinity and choose $V_{0}=0$, the electric potential at $B$ will be $V_{0}=\frac{W_{0}}{q}$. Generally,

$$
V=\frac{W}{q}
$$

Why is it advised to wear rubber soled shoes while handing electricappliances?
which states that the electric potential at any point in an electric field is equal to the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point keeping it in electrostatic equilibrium. So, the potential at a point is always relative to potential at infinity. Both potential and potential differences are scalar quantities because both $W$ and $q$ are scalars.

# Electric Field as Potential Gradient

In this section, we will establish a relation between electric intensity and potential difference. Let us consider the situation shown in Fig. 9.17. The electric field between the two charged plates is uniform and its value is $E$. The potential difference between $A$ and $B$ is given by the equation:

$$
V_{A}-V_{A}=\frac{W_{A B}}{q}
$$

where $W_{A B}=F d=-q E d$ (the negative sign is needed because $F$ must be applied opposite to $q E$ so as to keep it in equilibrium). With this, Eq. 9.24 becomes:

$$
V_{A}-V_{A}=\frac{-q E d}{q}=-E d
$$

or $E=\frac{\left(V_{A}-V_{A}\right)}{d}=-\frac{\Delta V}{d}$
If the plates $A$ and $B$ are separated by infinitesimally small distance $\Delta d$, the Eq. 9.25 is modified as:

$$
E=-\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}
$$

The quantity $\Delta V / \Delta d$ gives the maximum value of the rate of change of potential with distance because the charge has been moved along a field line in which the

distance $\Delta d$ between the two plates is minimum. It is known as potential gradient. Thus, the electric field intensity is equal to the negative of the gradient of electric potential. The negative sign indicates that the direction of $E$ is along the decreasing potential.
The unit of electric intensity from Eq.9.26 is volt/metre $\left(\mathrm{V} \mathrm{m}^{-1}\right)$ which is equal to $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$ as given below:

$$
1 \frac{\text { volt }}{\text { metre }}=1 \frac{\text { joule/coulomb }}{\text { metre }}=1 \frac{\text { newton } \times \text { metre }}{\text { metre } \times \text { coulomb }}=1 \frac{\text { newton }}{\text { coulomb }}=1 \mathrm{NC}^{-1}
$$

Example 9.4 Two parallel metal plates are 1.0 cm apart. These are connected to a battery of 12 volts. Find the magnitude of electric field intensity between them.

## Solution

Using the equation $\quad E=\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}$
Substituting the values,

$$
E=\frac{12 \mathrm{~V}}{1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}}=1200 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}
$$

Example 9.5 Two horizontal parallel metal plates are connected to a 12 volt battery. An electron is released from the negative plate. Determine its velocity as it reaches the positive plate. Mass of electron $=9.1 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~kg}$ and charge $=q=e=1.6 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{C}$.

## Solution

The electron is repelled by the negative plate and attracted by the positive plate. It will be accelerated towards positive plate. Therefore, its P.E. will be lost that will be converted into its K.E.
