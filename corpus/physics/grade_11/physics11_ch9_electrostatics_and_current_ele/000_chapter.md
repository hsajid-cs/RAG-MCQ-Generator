We know that magnitude of the charge on an electron is equal to that of a proton. The charge on a proton is $e^{\prime}$ and that on an electron is $e^{\prime \prime}$. Its value is; $e=1.6 \times 10^{-3}$ C where C (coulomb) is the SI unit of charge. This charge (e) is the smallest amount of free charge that has been discovered. Charges of larger magnitude are built up on an object by adding or removing electrons. It is the minimum amount of charge that any

# (1)

particle may contain. Thus, any amount of charge $q$ is an integer multiple of $e$, i.e.,

$$
q=N e \quad \text { where } N \text { is an integer }
$$

Electrostatics is the study of phenomena and properties of electric charges at rest. When charges are in motion, we call it as an electric current.

## Charles de Coulomb (1736-1806)

Coulomb's major contribution to science was in the field of electrostatics and magnetism. During his lifetime, he also investigated the strengths of material and determined the forces that effect on beams, thereby, contributing to the field of structural mechanics. In the field of ergonomics, his research provided a fundamental understanding of the ways in which people can best do work.

### 9.1 COULOMB'S LAW

Coulomb's law is a fundamental principle in electrostatics that quantifies the force between two charged objects. The first measurement of the force between electric charges was made by a French Physicist Charles de Coulomb in 1874. Coulomb's law is essential in understanding the behaviour of charged particles and the interactions that govern many electrical phenomena. On the basis of these measurements, he deduced a law known as Coulomb's law. It states that:
The force between two-point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. It is mathematically expressed as
Fig. 9.1
(a) Repulsive forces between like charges and
(b) attractive forces between unlike charges.

$$
F \propto \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \text { or } \quad F=k \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$

where $F$ is the magnitude of the mutual force that acts on each of the two point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}$, and $r$ is the distance between them. The force $F$ always acts along the line joining the two point charges (Fig. 9.1), $k$ is the constant of proportionality. Its value depends upon the nature of medium between the two charges and system of units in which $F, q$ and $r$ are measured. If the medium between the two point charges is free space and the system of units is SI, then $k$ is represented as

$$
k=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}
$$

where $\varepsilon_{0}$ is an electrical constant, known as permittivity of free space. In SI units, its value is $8.85 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{C}^{2} \mathrm{~N}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Substituting the value of $\varepsilon_{0}$ the constant

$$
k-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}-9 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{2}
$$

Thus, Coulomb's force in free space is

$$
F=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$

## Point to ponder?

Does an electrostatic force exist between a charged and an uncharged?

As stated earlier, Coulombs' force is mutual force, it means that if $q_{1}$ exerts a force on $q_{2}$, then $q_{2}$ also exerts an equal and opposite force on $q_{1}$ if we denote the force exerted on $q_{2}$ by $q_{1}$ as $F_{21}$ and that on charge $q_{1}$ due to $q_{2}$ as $F_{12}$ then

$$
F_{12}=-F_{21}
$$

The magnitude of both these two forces is the same and is given by Eq. 9.3. To represent the direction of these forces, we introduce unit vectors. If $\hat{r}_{21}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{1}$ to $q_{2}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{2}$ to $q_{1}$ then

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F_{21}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21} \\
& F_{12}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

The forces $F_{21}$ and $F_{12}$ are shown in Fig. 9.2 (a and b). It can be seen that $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21}=-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}$, so Eqs. 9.5 and 9.6 show that;

$$
\mathbf{F}_{21}=-\mathbf{F}_{12}
$$

The sign of the charges in Eqs. 9.5 and 9.6 determine whether the forces are attractive or repulsive.
We shall now consider the effect of medium between the two charges upon the Coulomb's force. If the medium is an insulator, it is usually referred as dielectric. It has been found that the presence of a dielectric always reduces the electrostatic force as compared with that in free space by a certain factor which is a constant for the given dielectric. This constant is known as relative permittivity and is represented by $\varepsilon$. The values of relative permittivity of different dielectrics are given in Table 9.1.
Thus, the Coulomb's force in a medium of relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{r}$ is given by

$$
F_{r}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{r}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$

It can be seen in the table that $\varepsilon_{r}$, for air is 1.0006 . This value is so close to one that with negligible error, the Eq. 9.3 gives the electric force in air.

Example 9.3 Three point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}$ and $q_{3}$ are lying in the same plane as shown in Fig. 9.3(a). Find the magnitude and direction of the net fore acting on $q_{1}$.

## Solution

Force on $q_{1}$ exerted by $q_{2}$ is attractive. Let it be $F_{12}$. Its magnitude is given by
Fig. 9.3(a)

$$
F_{12}=k \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r_{2}^{2}}=\frac{\left(9 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{2}\right)\left(40 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(60 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)}{(0.15 \mathrm{~m})^{2}}=960 \mathrm{~N}
$$

Force on $q_{1}$ exerted by $q_{2}$ is also attractive. Let it be $F_{12}$. Its magnitude is given by

$$
F_{12}-k \frac{q_{1} q_{3}}{r_{3}^{2}}-\frac{\left(9 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{Nm}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{2}\right)\left(40 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(50 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)}{\left(0.12 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)}-1250 \mathrm{~N}
$$

To find the resultant of $F_{12}$ and $F_{13}$, let us make free-body diagram, resolving $F_{13}$ into its rectangular components, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F_{13 x}=F_{13} \cos 60^{\circ}=1250 \mathrm{~N} \times 0.5=625 \mathrm{~N} \\
& F_{13 y}=F_{13} \sin 60^{\circ}=1250 \mathrm{~N} \times 0.86=1075 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

The $x$-component of resultant $F$ is

$$
F_{x}=F_{12}+F_{13} \cos 60^{\circ}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F_{x}=960 \mathrm{~N}+625 \mathrm{~N} \\
& F_{x}=1585 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

$y$-component of $F$ is:

$$
F_{y}-F_{12} \sin 60^{\circ}-1075 \mathrm{~N}
$$

Magnitude of $F$ is given by

$$
F=\sqrt{F_{x}^{2}+F_{y}^{2}}=1975 \mathrm{~N}
$$

For direction of $F$ :

$$
\tan 9=\frac{F_{y}}{F_{x}}=\frac{1075}{1585}=0.68
$$

A Van de Graaff generator is an electrostatic generator which uses a moving belt to accumulate electric charge on a hollow metal globe on the top of an insulated column, creating very high voltage direct current (DC) at low current levels. It was invented by an American physicist Robert J. Van de Graff in 1920.
The potential difference achieved in modern Van de Graaff generators can reach 5 megavolts. A tabletop version can produce of the order of 100,000 volts and can produce enough energy to produce a visible spark.
A pulley drives an inauiting belt by a sharply pointed metal comb which has been given a positive charge by a power supply. Electrons are removed from the belt, leaving it positively charged. A similar comb at the top allows the net positive charge to spread to the dome.
Why do the hairs lift when VAN DE GRAAFF GENERATOR is touched?

Therefore, $B=34^{\circ}$ with the line joining $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$.

# 9.2 ELECTRIC FIELD STRENGTH

We have learnt that a charge experiences an electrostatic force in the presence of other charges. Let us consider a positively charged object $Q$. If we place a small charge $+q$ at point $A$, it will experience an electrostatic force $F$ due to the charge $Q$. Thus, an electric field is said to exist at point $A$. Coulomb's law suggests that the field gets stronger as the point $A$ gets closer to $Q$ as represented in Fig. 9.4. The strength of the field at a position is known as its intensity at that point.
Fig. 9.4

The electric intensity of the field or simply electric field at any point is defined as the force experienced by a unit positive charge placed at that point.
Electric intensity is a force, so it is a vector quantity and is usually denoted by $E$. It can be obtained by the relation:

# Physics II

$$
E=\frac{F}{q}
$$

As

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q Q}{r^{2}} \quad \therefore \quad E-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^{2}} \\
& \text { In vector form: } \\
& E=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^{2}} \hat{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

From Eq. 9.8, the unit of electric intensity is newton per coulomb $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$. The direction of $E$ is the same as that of $F$. The Eq. 9.5 can also be written as:

$$
F=q E
$$

(9.9)

Example 9.2 Two positive point charges $q_{1}=16.0 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and $q_{2}=4.0 \mu \mathrm{C}$ are separated by a distance of 3.0 m , as shown in Fig.9.5. Find the spot on the line joining the two charges where electric field is zero.
Fig. 9.5

Solution Between the two charges, the fields contributed by them have opposite directions, and electric field would be zero at a point $P$, where the magnitude of $E_{1}$ equals to $E_{2}$. In Fig. 9.5, let the distance of $P$ from $q_{1}$ be $d$. At $P_{1} E_{2}=E_{2}$ which implies that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1}}{(3.0-d)^{2}}-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{2}}{d^{2}} \\
& \text { or } \quad \frac{16.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}}{9.0+d^{2}-6 d}=\frac{4.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}}{d^{2}} \text { or } d^{2}+2 d-3=0 \text {, which gives } d=+1 \mathrm{~m},-3 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

There are two values of $d$, the negative value corresponds to a location off to the right of both the charges where magnitudes of $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are equal but directions are same. In this case $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ do not cancel at this spot. The positive value corresponds to the location shown in the figure and is the zero filed location, hence, $d=+1.0 \mathrm{~m}$.

Example 9.3 A proton experiences an electrostatic force equal to its weight at a particular point in an electric field. What is the field intensity at that point?
Mass of proton $=1.67 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg}$ and charge, $e=1.6 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{C}$
Using

$$
E=\frac{F}{q}=\frac{m g}{e}
$$

Substituting the values,

$$
E=\frac{1.67 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}}{1.6 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{C}}=1.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{NC}^{-1}
$$

## Electric Field Lines

A visual representation of the electric field can be obtained in terms of electric field lines, an idea proposed by Michael Faraday. Electric field lines can be considered as a visual map used to represent the direction and strength of an electric field around a charged object. As electric field lines provide information about the electric force exerted on a

charged object, these lines are commonly called "electric lines of force".
To introduce electric field lines, we place positive test charges $+q_{0}$ each of magnitude $q_{0}$ at different places but at equal distances from a positive charge $+q$ as shown in the Fig. 9.6. Each test charge will experience a repulsive force, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 9.6(a). Therefore, the electric field created by the charge $+q$ is directed radially outward. Figure 9.6(b) shows corresponding field lines which show the field
Fig 9.6
(a) A positive test charge $+q_{0}$ placed anywhere in the vicinity of a positive point charge $+q$ experiences a repulsive force directed radially outward.
(b) The electric field lines are directed radially outward from the positive point charge $+q$.
direction. Figure 9.7 shows the electric field lines in the vicinity of a negative charge $-q$. In this case the lines are directed radially "inward", because the force on a positive test charge is now of attraction, indicating the electric field points inward.
Figures 9.6 and 9.7 represent two dimensional pictures of the field lines. However, electric field lines emerge from the charges in three dimensions, and an infinite number of lines could be drawn.
The electric field lines "map" also provides information about the strength of the electric field. As we notice in Figs. 9.6 and 9.7 that field lines are closer to each other near the charges where the field is strong while they continuously spread out indicating a continuous decrease in the field strength.

The number of lines per unit area passing perpendicularly through it is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field.
The electric field lines are curved in case of two identical separated charges. Figure 9.8 shows the pattern of lines associated with two identical positive point charges of
Fig 9.7: The electric field lines are directed radially inward towards a negative point charge $-q$.
Fig.9.8: The electric field lines for two identical opposite point charges.

equal magnitude. It reveals that the lines in the region between two like charges seem to repel each other. The behaviour of two identical negatively charges will be exactly the same. The middle region shows the presence of a zero field spot or neutral zone.
Figure 9.9 shows the electric field pattern of two opposite charges of equal magnitudes. The field lines start from positive charge and end on a negative charge. The electric field at points such as $1,2,3$ is the resultant of fields created by the two charges at these points. The directions of the resultant intensities is given by the tangents drawn to the field lines at these points.
In the regions where the field lines are parallel and equally spaced, the same number of lines pass per unit area and therefore, field is uniform on all points. Figure 9.10 shows the field lines between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor. The field is uniform in the middle region where field lines are equally spaced.
We are now in a position to summarize the properties of electric field lines.

1. Electric field lines originate from positive charges and end on negative charges.
2. The tangent to a field line at any point gives the direction of the electric field at that point.
3. The lines are closer where the field is strong and the lines are farther apart where the field is weak.
4. No two lines cross each other. This is because E hes only one direction at any given point. If the lines cross E could have more than one direction.

### 9.3 ELECTRIC FLUX

When we place an element of area in an electric field, some of the lines of force pass through it (Fig. 9.11). The number of the field lines passing through a certain element of area is known as electric flux through that area. It is usually denoted by Greek letter $\phi_{0}$. For example, the electric flux $\phi_{0}$ through the area $A$ is 4 while the flux through B is 2 .
In order to give a quantitative meaning to flux, the field
Fig 9.9: The electric field lines are directed radially in ward towards a negative point charge -c.
Fig 9.10: In the central region of a parallel plate capacitor, the electric field lines are parallel and evenly spaced, indicating that the electric field there has the same magnitude and direction at points.

Do you know?
There is no electric field inside the conductor.
Fig.9.11: Electric flux through a surface normal to E.

lines are drawn such that the number of field lines passing through a unit area held perpendicular to field lines at a point represent the intensity $E$ of the field at that point.
Usually, the element of area is represented by a vector area $A$ whose magnitude is equal to the surface area $A$ of the element and direction is along normal to the area.
In Fig.9.12 (a), area $A$ is held perpendicular to the field lines, then EA lines pass through it. The flux $\phi_{n}$ in this case is:

$$
\phi_{n}=E A
$$

In Figure 9.12 (b), area $A$ is held parallel to field lines and, as is obvious no lines cross this area, so that flux $\phi_{n}$ in this case is:

$$
\phi_{n}=E A=0
$$

Figure 9.12(c) shows the case when $A$ is neither perpendicular nor parallel to field lines but is inclined at an angle $\theta$ with the field $E$. In this case, we have to find the projection of the area which is perpendicular to the field lines. The area of this projection (Fig. 9.12-c) is $A \cos \theta$. The flux $\phi_{n}$ in this case is:

$$
\phi_{n}=E A \cos \theta
$$

The electric flux $\phi_{n}$ through a patch of flat surface in terms of $E$ and $A$ is then given by

$$
\phi_{n}=E A \cos \theta=E \cdot A
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the field lines and the normal to the area. Electric flux being a scalar product, is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit is $\mathrm{Nm}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{4}$.

# Electric Flux Through a Surface Enclosing a Charge

Let us calculate the electric flux through a closed surface, in shape of a sphere of radius $r$ due to a point charge $q$ placed at the centre of sphere as shown in Fig. 9.13. To apply the formula $\phi_{n}=E . A$ for the computation of eleotric flux, the surface area should be flat. For this reason the total surface area of the
Fig.9.12(a): Maximum
Fig.9.12(b): Minimum
Fig.9.13: The total electric flux through the surface of the sphere due to a charge $q$ at its centre is $q \delta_{0}$.

sphere is divided into $n$ small patches with areas of magnitudes $\Delta A_{1}, \Delta A_{2}, \Delta A_{3}, \ldots \ldots$ $\Delta A_{n}$, respectively as shown in Fig. 9.13. The direction of each vector area is along perpendicular drawn outward to the corresponding patch. The electric intensities at the centres of vector areas $\Delta A_{1}, \Delta A_{2}, \Delta A_{3}, \ldots \ldots, \Delta A_{n}$ are $E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}, \ldots \ldots, E_{n}$ respectively.
According to Eq. 9.13, the total flux passing through the closed surface is:

$$
Q_{n}=E_{1} \cdot \Delta A_{1}+E_{2} \cdot \Delta A_{2}+E_{3} \cdot \Delta A_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+E_{n} \cdot \Delta A_{n}
$$

The direction of electric intensity and vector area is the same at each patch. Moreover,

$$
\left|E_{1}\right|=\left|E_{2}\right|=\left|E_{3}\right|=\ldots \ldots \ldots=\left|E_{n}=E=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{n}} \frac{q}{r^{2}}\right.
$$

Since $E$ is parallel to vector area $A_{1}$ therefore, $\theta=0^{\circ}$ (Fig. 9.13) so for each $E . \Delta A=E A \cos 0$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =E A \cos 0^{\circ}=E A \quad\left(\because \cos 0^{\circ}=1\right) \\
& \phi_{0}-E \Delta A_{1}+E \Delta A_{2}+E \Delta A_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+E \Delta A_{n} \\
& -E\left(\Delta A_{1}+\Delta A_{2}+\Delta A_{3}-\ldots \ldots+\Delta A_{n}\right) \\
& -E \text { (Total spherical surface area) } \\
& =\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{n}} \frac{q}{r^{2}} \times 4 \pi r^{2} \\
& \phi_{0}=\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{n}} \\
& \text { (9.16) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Now Imagine that a closed surface $S$ is enclosing this sphere. It can be seen in Fig 9.14 that the flux through
Fig: 9.14
the closed surface $S$ is the same as that through the sphere. So, we can conclude that total flux through a closed surface does not depend upon the shape or geometry of the closed surface. It depends upon the medium and the charge enclosed.

# 9.4 GAUSS'S LAW

Suppose point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, \ldots \ldots, q_{n}$ are arbitrarily distributed within an arbitrarily shaped closed surface, as shown in Fig. 9.15. Since $\phi_{n}=q / \varepsilon_{n}$, so the electric flux passing through the closed surface is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \phi_{0}=\frac{q_{1}}{\varepsilon_{n}}\left|\frac{q_{2}}{\varepsilon_{n}}\right| \frac{q_{3}}{\varepsilon_{n}} \mid \ldots \ldots \cdot \frac{q_{n}}{\varepsilon_{n}} \\
& \phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n}} \times\left(q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+q_{n}\right) \\
& \phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n}} \times \text { (Total charge enclosed by closed surface) } \\
& \phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n}} \times Q
\end{aligned}
$$

Fig: 9.15

$$
\phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n}} \times Q
$$

where $Q=q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+q_{n}$ is the total charge enclosed by closed surface. Equation 9.17 is mathematical expression of Gauss's law which can be slated as:

The total electric flux through any closed surface is $1 / k_{0}$ times the total charge enclosed in it.

# Applications of Gauss's Law

Gauss's law can be applied to calculate the electric intensity due to different charge configurations. In all such cases, an imaginary closed surface is considered which passes through the point at which the electric intensity is to be evaluated. This closed surface is known as Gaussian surface. Its choice is such that the flux through it can be easily evaluated.
As an example, let us find the electric field at any point outside a sphere on which a charge $q$ is placed.

## The Field of a Charged Conducting Sphere

Consider a conducting sphere of radius $R$ containing a charge $q$. We know that all the charge is distributed uniformly over the surface of sphere as shown in Fig. 9.16. We can also conclude from the spherical symmetry that the electric field is radial everywhere and that its magnitude depends only on the distance $r$ from the centre of the sphere. Thus, the magnitude $E$ is uniform over a spherical surface with any radius $r$ concentric with the spherical conductor. Therefore, we take our Gaussian surface as an imaginary sphere with radius $r$ greater than the radius $R$ of the conducting sphere.
The area of the Gaussian sphere is $4 \pi r^{2}$, and because $E$ is uniform over the sphere, the total flux through the whole surface will be:
Electric flux

$$
\phi_{2}=E A=E \times 4 \pi r^{2}
$$

By Gauss's law, total flux is:

Therefore

$$
E \times 4 \pi r^{2}=\frac{q}{E}
$$

or

$$
E=\frac{q}{E_{1}} \frac{1}{4 \pi r^{2}}
$$

or

$$
E=\frac{1}{4 \pi E_{1}} \times \frac{q}{r^{2}}
$$

Fig: 9.16

This shows that the field at any point outside the sphere is the same as though the entire charge were concentrated at its centre. Just outside of the sphere, where $r=R$, i.e.,

$$
E=\frac{1}{4 \pi E_{1}} \frac{q}{R^{2}}
$$

In vector form;

$$
\mathbf{E}=\frac{1}{4 \pi E_{1}} \frac{q}{R^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the direction of $\mathbf{E}$.

# 9.5 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

Figure 9.17 shows two oppositely charged parallel plated which produce a uniform electric field.
Let us consider a positive charge $q$ which is allowed to move in this uniform electric field. The positive charge will move from plate $B$ to $A$ and will gain $K . E$. If it is to be moved from $A$ to $B$, an external force is needed to make the charge move against the electric field and will gain P.E. Let us impose a condition that as the charge is moved from $A$ to $B$, it is moved keeping electrostatic equilibrium, i.e., it moves with uniform velocity. This
Fig 9.17
condition could be achieved by applying a force $F$ equal and opposite to $q E$ at every point along its path. The work done by the external force against the electric field increases electrical potential energy of the charge that is moved.
Let $W_{\text {Aa }}$ be the work done by the force in carrying the positive charge $q$ from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium. The change in its potential energy $\Delta U=W_{\text {Aa }}$.
or $\quad U_{0}-U_{A}=W_{A B}$
where $U_{A}$ and $U_{0}$, are defined to be the potential energies at points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
To describe electric field, we introduce the idea of electric potential difference. The potential difference between two points $A$ and $B$ in an electric field is defined as the work done in carrying a unit positive charge from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium, i.e.,

$$
\Delta V=V_{B}-V_{A}=\frac{W_{A B}}{q}=\frac{\Delta U}{q}
$$

where $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ are defined as electric potentials at points $A$ and $B$ respectively. Electric potential energy difference and electric potential difference between the points $A$ and $B$ are related as:

$$
\Delta U=q \Delta V
$$

Thus, the potential difference between the two points can be defined as the difference of the potential energy per unit charge.
An ECG records the "voltage" between points on human skin generated by electrical process in the heart. This ECG is made in running position providing information about the heart's performance under stress.

As the unit of P.E. is joule, Eq. 9.20 shows that the unit of potential difference is joule per coulomb. It is called volt such that,

$$
1 \text { volt }=\frac{1 \text { joule }}{1 \text { coulomb }}
$$

That is, a potential difference of 1 volt exists between two points if work done in moving a 1 coulomb positive charge from one point to the other, keeping electrostatic equilibrium, is one joule.
In order to give a concept of electric potential at a point in an electric field, we must have a reference to which we assign zero electric potential. This point is usually taken at infinity. Thus, in Eq. 9.20, if we take point $A$ to be at infinity and choose $V_{0}=0$, the electric potential at $B$ will be $V_{0}=\frac{W_{0}}{q}$. Generally,

$$
V=\frac{W}{q}
$$

Why is it advised to wear rubber soled shoes while handing electricappliances?
which states that the electric potential at any point in an electric field is equal to the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point keeping it in electrostatic equilibrium. So, the potential at a point is always relative to potential at infinity. Both potential and potential differences are scalar quantities because both $W$ and $q$ are scalars.

# Electric Field as Potential Gradient

In this section, we will establish a relation between electric intensity and potential difference. Let us consider the situation shown in Fig. 9.17. The electric field between the two charged plates is uniform and its value is $E$. The potential difference between $A$ and $B$ is given by the equation:

$$
V_{A}-V_{A}=\frac{W_{A B}}{q}
$$

where $W_{A B}=F d=-q E d$ (the negative sign is needed because $F$ must be applied opposite to $q E$ so as to keep it in equilibrium). With this, Eq. 9.24 becomes:

$$
V_{A}-V_{A}=\frac{-q E d}{q}=-E d
$$

or $E=\frac{\left(V_{A}-V_{A}\right)}{d}=-\frac{\Delta V}{d}$
If the plates $A$ and $B$ are separated by infinitesimally small distance $\Delta d$, the Eq. 9.25 is modified as:

$$
E=-\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}
$$

The quantity $\Delta V / \Delta d$ gives the maximum value of the rate of change of potential with distance because the charge has been moved along a field line in which the

# Physics II

distance $\Delta d$ between the two plates is minimum. It is known as potential gradient. Thus, the electric field intensity is equal to the negative of the gradient of electric potential. The negative sign indicates that the direction of $E$ is along the decreasing potential.
The unit of electric intensity from Eq.9.26 is volt/metre $\left(\mathrm{V} \mathrm{m}^{-1}\right)$ which is equal to $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$ as given below:

$$
1 \frac{\text { volt }}{\text { metre }}=1 \frac{\text { joule/coulomb }}{\text { metre }}=1 \frac{\text { newton } \times \text { metre }}{\text { metre } \times \text { coulomb }}=1 \frac{\text { newton }}{\text { coulomb }}=1 \mathrm{NC}^{-1}
$$

Example 9.4 Two parallel metal plates are 1.0 cm apart. These are connected to a battery of 12 volts. Find the magnitude of electric field intensity between them.

## Solution

Hera, $\Lambda V=12 \mathrm{~V}, \Lambda d=1.0 \mathrm{~cm}=1 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}, E=$ ?
Using the equation $\quad E=\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}$
Substituting the values,

$$
E=\frac{12 \mathrm{~V}}{1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}}=1200 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}
$$

Example 9.5 Two horizontal parallel metal plates are connected to a 12 volt battery. An electron is released from the negative plate. Determine its velocity as it reaches the positive plate. Mass of electron $=9.1 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~kg}$ and charge $=q=e=1.6 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{C}$.

## Solution

The electron is repelled by the negative plate and attracted by the positive plate. It will be accelerated towards positive plate. Therefore, its P.E. will be lost that will be converted into its K.E.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Loss of } P . E & =\text { Gain in } K . E \\
\Delta V \times e & =\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Submitting the values,

$$
\begin{aligned}
12 \mathrm{~V} \times 1.6 \times 10^{19} \mathrm{C} & =\frac{1}{2} \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg} \times v^{2} \\
v^{2} & =4.2 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
v & =2.1 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

### 9.6 ELECTRON VOLT

We know that when a particle of charge $q$ moves from point $A$ at potential $V_{A}$ to a point $B$ at potential $V_{B}$ keeping electrostatic equilibrium, the change in potential energy $\Lambda U$ of particle is:

$$
\Delta U=q\left(V_{B}-V_{A}\right)=q \Delta V
$$

If no external force acts on the charge to maintain equilibrium, this change in P.E. appears in the form of change in $K . E$.
Suppose charge carried by the particle is $q=e=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$.
Thus, in this case, the energy acquired by the charge will be:

$$
\Delta K . E .-q \Delta V-e \Delta V-\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right)(\Delta V)
$$

Moreover, assume that $\Delta V=1$ volt, hence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta K . E .=q \Delta V=\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right) \times(1 \mathrm{volt}) \\
& \Delta K . E .=\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right) \times(\mathrm{CxV})=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

The amount of energy equal to $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}$ is called one electron-volt and is denoted by 1 eV . It is defined as "the amount of energy acquired or lost by an electron as it traverses a potential difference of one volt". Thus,

$$
1 \mathrm{eV}=1.6 \times 10^{19} \mathrm{~J}
$$

Example 9.6 A particle carrying a charge of $2 e$ falls through a potential difference of 3.0 V . Calculate the energy required by it.

$$
\text { Solution } \quad q=2 e, \Delta V=3.0 \mathrm{~V}
$$

The energy acquired by the particle is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta U=q \Delta V & =(2 e)(3.0 \mathrm{~V})=6.0 \mathrm{eV} \\
\Delta U & =6.0 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}=9.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 9.7 MOTION OF CHAROED PARTICLES IN A UNIFORM ELECTRIC FIELD

Two oppositely charged parallel metal plates produce uniform electric field between them. The direction of electricfieid is from positive to negative plate. A positive charge $+q$ placed in the field will move in the direction of electric field whereas a negative charge $-q$ will move opposite to the electric field. The magnitude of electric force acting on a charge qis represented in Fig 9.18 given by

$$
F=q E
$$

where $E$ is the electric intensity of the uniform electric field. If $V$ is the potential difference between the plates and $d$ is the separation of plates, then

$$
E=\frac{V}{d}
$$

Fig. 9.18

To understand the effect of uniform electric field on the motion of charged particles, let us consider an electron placed between the two plates. The electron accelerates towards the positive plate due to a force $F$ acting on it.

For example, let $V=20 \mathrm{~V}, d=2.0 \mathrm{~cm}=2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}$, the magnitude of $E$ will be:

$$
E=\frac{V}{d}=\frac{20 \mathrm{~V}}{2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}}=1000 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{C}^{-1}
$$

The acceleration for the electron will be given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=m a \\
& a=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{q E}{m}
\end{aligned}
$$

The charge on an electron $q=e=1.6 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{C}$ and mass of electron $m=9.1 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{~kg}$. So,

$$
a=\frac{1.6 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{C} \times 1000 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{C}^{-1}}{9.1 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{~kg}}=1.76 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2}
$$

If the electron is released from the negative plate, the velocity gained by it when it reaches positive plate can be found by the third equation of mation.

$$
2 a S=v_{f}^{2}-v_{f}^{2}
$$

Here

$$
S=d=2 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~m}, v_{1}=0, v_{2}=v=?
$$

Putting the values in the above equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 \times 1.76 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \times 2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}=v^{2} \\
& v^{2}=7.04 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
& v=2.65 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 9.8 PATH OF A CHARGED PARTICLE

The path of a charged particle is determined by the electric field in the region. The path is typically straight if the field is uniform and the charged particle is moving along the field. However, if a charged particle enters perpendicularly to the uniform field between the oppositely charged parallel plates with a certain velocity as shown in Fig. 9.19, it will not go straight. Its path will be parabolic just like a projectile thrown horizontally in the gravitational field. The horizontal component of the velocity of the charged particle remains constant whereas vertical component is accelerated due to the electric force.
Figure 9.19 shows that a positivity charged particle is attracted towards the negatively charged plate and thus undergoes deflection in that direction.
(a)
(b)

Fig. 9.19

On the other hand, a negatively charged particle is attracted towards the positively charged plate and experiences deflection in that direction.

# 9.9 SHIELDING FROM EXTERNAL ELECTRIC FIELD

An English scientist Michael Faraday invented a structure in 1836, called Faraday cage or Faraday shield. Faraday cage is an enclosure that blocks the external electric fields in conductive materials. It acts like a hollow conductor where devices or objects can be put for protection from electrical external fields. Any electrical shock received by the cage runs through its outer surface without causing any harm inside. The electric field inside the hollow conductor remains zero.
To understand the working of Faraday cage, suppose that a piece of conductor (say copper) carries a number of free electrons. Each electron will experience a force of repulsion because of the electric field of its neighbouring electrons. As a consequence, all the electrons rush to the surface of the conductor. Once static equilibrium is established with all of the excess charges on the surface, no further movement of charge occurs. If some electrons shift from the conductor to another object due to friction etc., a net positive charge appears on the surface of the conductor. We can say,

At equilibrium under electrostatic conditions, any
excess charge resides on the surface of a conductor.
Now consider the interior of the hollow conductor. The excess charges arrange themselves on the conductor's surface precisely in the manner that the total field within the interior becomes zero. In other words,
The conductor shields any charge within it from electric fields outside the conductor.
To eliminate the interference of external fields, circuits are often enclosed within metal boxes that provide shielding from such fields.
Figure 9.20 shows another aspect of how conductors alter the electric field lines created by external charges.
Fig. 9.20

The lines are altered because the electric field just outside the surface of a conductor is perpendicular to the surface at equilibrium under electrostatic conditions. If the field were not perpendicular, there would be a component of the field parallel to the surface. Since the free electrons on the surface of the conductor can move, they would do so under the force exerted by the parallel component. But in reality, no electron flow occurs at equilibrium. Therefore, there can be no parallel component, and the electric field is perpendicular to the surface.
The principle of Faraday cage demands a material that contains a lot of free electrons that can move freely to the surface of the material. Only the conductors have free

electrons whereas insulators do not contain free electron, so the insulators can not be used to construct Faraday cage.
A good example of Faraday cage in our daily life is that of cars. The chassis and bodies of cars protect people inside due to its metal framed structure during the thunderstorms. The electrical charge travels over the metal surface of the vehicle into the ground and prevent the passengers inside.
A metal body of the microwave oven acts as a Faraday cage. Thus, they prevent the microwaves in an oven from expanding into the environment. Metal frame of an airplane also acts as a Faraday cage. When lightning strikes an airplane, electricity is distributed along its metal frame surface that keeps passengers and all devices inside the airplane safe.

# 9.10 ELECTRIC CURRENT

Usually, it is said that electric current is the flow of charge. Let us see what actually flows in a conductor. The charge carriers are the free electrons. When the ends of a conductor are connected to a battery or some other source of potential, an electric field is set up at every point within the conductor. The free electrons experience a force in the direction of -E and they start moving. As the free electrons are bumping among the atoms, so they are not accelerated in a straight line under this force. They keep on colliding with the atoms of the conductor. The overall effect of these collisions is to transfer the energy of accelerated eletrons to the lattice with the result that the electrons acquire an average velocity, called the drift velocity in the direction of -E . The drift velocity is of the order of $10^{-4} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This drift velocity of electrons forms the electric current. The slow drift velocity does not mean that it takes long time for an electric current to set up. We know that as soon as we switch ON a bulb, itlitup immediately.
The reason is that on turning the switch ON, all the free electrons in the circuit start drifting. They repel the neighbouring ones and the disturbance propagates along the wire almost instantaneously. That is why, the electric current is set up very rapidly.
If a net charge $Q$ passes through any cross-section of a conductor in time $t$, the current $I$ flowing through it is:

$$
I=\frac{Q}{T}
$$

The SI unit of current is ampere (A) and it is the current due to flow of one coulomb charge per second through any cross-section of a conductor. If the charges move around a circuit in the same direction at all times, the current is said to be direct current (D.C). For example, batteries produce direct current. If the charges move first one way and then the opposite way, changing direction in regular intervals, the current is said to be alternating current (A.C). Mostly the electric generators produce A.C. The electricity supplied to our homes, offices, factories etc., by power stations is an A.C.

## Conventional Current

As we now understand, the electric current is due to flow of electrons through the metal

wires, but early scientists believed that electric current was due to flow of positive charges. The scientists have kept the convention and take the direction of current flow to be the direction in which positive charges would move. We call it conventional current.

Conventional current is hypothetical flow of positive charges that would have the same effect in the circuit as the flow of negative charges that actually does occur.

In Fig. 9.21, negative electrons arrive at the positive terminal of the battery. The same effect would have been achieved if an equivalent amount of positive charge has left the positive terminal. Therefore, we can say that the conventional current flows from positive terminal towards the negative terminal of a battery. A conventional current is consistent with our earlier use of a positive test charge for
defining electric fields and potential. The direction of conventional current is always from a point of higher potential towards a point of lower potential that is from the positive terminal towards the negative terminal. Now onward the current / always means the conventional current.

# 9.11 CURRENT THROUGH A CONDUCTOR

Consider a segment of the current carrying conductor having length $L$ and area of crosssection $A$. The volume of the segment is $A L$, as represented in Fig. 9.22. Let $n$ be the number of charge carriers per unit volume, then total number of charge carriers in the segment at any time are $n A L$. If the charge on a charge carrier is $q$, the total change present
Fig. 9.22: Negative charge carriers
inside the segment at any instant is:

$$
Q=n A L q
$$

Usually, the charge carriers in a conductor are free electrons which have negative charge.
Suppose that charge carriers move towards left face of the segment when a potential difference is applied across the conductor. Then electric current is set up in the conductor directed towards right face. Assuming that drift velocity of the charge carries to be $v$, the time taken $t$ by all the charge carriers originally present in the

## Flow of current is directly proportional to the potential difference.
Flow of heat is directly proportional to the temperature difference.
Flow of fluid is directly proportional to the pressure difference.

## For your information?

Current is a flow of charge, pressured into motion by voltage and hampered by resistance.

segment to exit through the left face will be:
By definition of the current

$$
\begin{aligned}
& t=\frac{L}{v} \\
& i=\frac{Q}{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the value of $Q$ and $t$ in the above equation, we have

$$
i=\frac{n A L q}{L_{v}}
$$

or

$$
I=n A v q
$$

(1) Example 9.7 A copper wire has a cross-sectional area of $2 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and carries a current of 3 A . If the number of elections per unit volume is $8.5 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$, calculate the drift velocity of the electrons in the wire. Charge on an electron is $1.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{C}$.

# Solusion

$$
I=3 \mathrm{~A}, \quad A=2 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^{2}, \quad n=8.5 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~m}^{3}, \quad q=1.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{C}, \quad v=?
$$

Using equation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& I=\text { Anvq } \\
& 3=\left(2 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)\left(8.5 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~m}^{3}\right) v\left(1.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{C}\right) \\
& v=1.1 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

### 9.12 OHM'S LAW

When a potential difference $V$ is applied across the ends of a conductor, a current / starts flowing through it. The Ohm'slaw states that:

The current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference applied across the conductor, provided there is no charge in the physical state of the conductor.
Mathematically,

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
& I \propto V & \text { or } \quad V \propto I \\
\text { or } & V=I R & (9.34)
\end{array}
$$

where $R$ is a constant of proportionality known as resistance of the conductor. The SI unit of resistance is ohm denoted by the Greek capital letter omega ( $\Omega$ ), and is defined as:

The resistance of a conductor is 1 ohm if a current of 1 ampere flows through it when a potential difference of 1 volt is applied across its ends.

### 9.13 RESISTIVITY AND ITS DEPENDENCE UPON TEMPERATURE

It has been experimentally seen that the resistance $R$ of a wire is directly proportional to

its length $L$ and inversely proportional to its cross sectional area $A$. Mathematically,

$$
R \propto \frac{L}{A}
$$

$$
R=\rho \frac{L}{A}
$$

where $p$ (rho) is a constant of proportionality known as resistivity or specific resistance of the material of the wire. It may be noted that resistance is the characteristic of a particular wire whereas the resistivity is the property of the material of which the wire is made. From Eq. 9.35, we have

$$
\rho=\frac{R A}{L}
$$

The above equation gives the definition of resistivity as the resistance of a metre cube of a material. The SI unit of resistivity is ohm-metre ( $\Omega \mathrm{m}$ )
Conductance is another quantity used to describe the electrical properties of materials. In fact, conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, i.e.

$$
\text { Conductance }=\frac{1}{\text { Resistance }}, G=\frac{1}{R}, G \text { is the conductance. }
$$

Mathematically, conductivity, $\sigma$ (sigma) is the reciprocal of resistivity ( $\rho$ ), i.e.

$$
\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}
$$

The SI unit of conductivity is ohm " $m$ " or mho m". Resistivity of various materials is given in Table 9.2. It may be noted from Table 9.2 that silver and copper are two best conductors. That is the reason, most of electric wires are made of copper.
The resistivity of a substance depends upon the temperature also. It can be explained by recalling that the resistance offered by a conductor to the flow of electric current is due to collisions, which the free electrons encounter with atoms of the lattice. As the temperature of the conductor rises, the amplitude of vibration of the atoms in the lattice increases and hence, the probability of their collision with free electrons also increases. One may say that the atoms then offer a bigger target, that is the collision cross-section of the atoms increases with temperature. This makes the collisions between free electrons and the atoms in the lattice more frequent and hence, the resistance of the conductor increases.

# Physica II

Experimentally, the change in resistance of a metallic conductor with temperature is found to be nearly linear over a considerable range of temperature above and below $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (Fig.9.23). Over such a range the fractional change in resistance per kelvin is known as the temperature coefficient ( $\alpha$ ) of resistance, i.e.

$$
\alpha=\frac{R_{i}-R_{0}}{R_{0} t}
$$

where $R_{0}$ and $R_{i}$ are resistances at temperatures $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $t^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ respectively. As resistivity $\rho$ depends upon the temperature, Eq. 9.35 gives

$$
R_{i}=\eta \frac{L}{A} \text { and } R_{0}=\eta \frac{L}{A}
$$

Substituting the values of $R_{i}$ and $R_{0}$ in Eq. 9.39, we have

$$
\alpha=\frac{\eta-\rho_{0}}{\rho_{0} t}
$$

where $\rho_{0}$ is the resistivity of a conductor at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $\rho_{i}$ is the resistivity at $t^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Values of temperature coefficients of resistance of some substances are also listed in Table 9.2. There are some substances like germanium, silicon, etc. whose resistance decreases with increase in temperature, these substances have negative temperature coefficients.

## Inspectors can easily check the reliability of a concrete bridge made with carbon fibers. The fibers conduct electricity. If sensors show that electrical resistance is increasing over time the fibers are separating because of cracks.

Example 9.8 0.75 A current flows through an iron wire when a battery of 1.5 V is connected across its ends. The length of the wire is 5.0 m and its cross-sectional area is $2.5 \times 10^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Compute the resistivity of iron.

## Solution

The resistance $R$ of the wire can be calculated by Eq. 9.34 i.e.,

$$
R=\frac{V}{i}=\frac{1.5 \mathrm{~V}}{0.75 \mathrm{~A}}=2.0 \mathrm{VA}^{\prime}=2.0 \Omega
$$

The resistivity $\rho$ of iron of which the wire is made of is given by

$$
\rho=R \frac{A}{L}=\frac{2.0 \Omega \times 2.5 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{2}}{5.0 \mathrm{~m}}=1.0 \times 10^{-1} \Omega \mathrm{~m}
$$

Example 9.9 A platinum wire has resistance of $10 \Omega$ at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $20 \Omega$ at $193^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Find the value of temperature coefficient of resistance of platinum.

$$
R_{0}=10 \Omega, R_{i}=20 \Omega, t=466 \mathrm{~K}-273 \mathrm{~K}=193 \mathrm{~K}
$$

Temperature coefficient of resistance can be found by

$$
\alpha=\frac{R_{f}-R_{0}}{R_{0} t}=\frac{20 \Omega-10 \Omega}{10 \Omega \times 193 \mathrm{~K}}=\frac{1}{193 \mathrm{~K}}=5.18 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}
$$

# 9.14 ELECTRICAL POWER

Consider a circuit consisting of a battery of emf $\varepsilon$ connected in series with a resistance $R$ (Fig. 9.24). A steady current flows through the circuit and a steady potential difference $V$ exists between the terminals $A$ and $B$ of the resistor $R$. Terminal $A$, connected to the positive pole of the battery, is at a higher potential than the terminal B. In this circuit the battery is continuously lifting charge uphill through the potential difference $V$. Using the meaning of potential difference, the work done in moving a charge $Q$ up through the potential difference $V$ is given by

$$
\text { Work done }=W=V \times Q \text {. } \\
\text { This is the energy supplied by the battery. }
$$

The rate at which the battery is supplying electrical energy is the power output or electrical power of the battery. Using the definition of power, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Electrical power } & =\frac{\text { Energy supplied }}{\text { Time taken }}=V \frac{Q}{t} \\
\text { Since } \quad I & =\frac{Q}{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

The above equation can also be written as:
Fig. 9.24: The power of a battery appears as the power dissipated in the resistance $R$.

Electrical power $=V I$
Equation 9.42 is a general relation for power delivered from a source of current $I$ operating on a voltage $V$. In the circuit shown in Fig. 9.24 the power supplied by the battery is expended or dissipated in the resistor $R$. The principle of conservation of energy tells us that the power dissipated in the resistor is also given by Eq. 9.42.

Power dissipated $P=V I$
Alternative equation for calculating power can be found by substituting $V=I R, I=V / R$ in turn in Eq. 9.42.
or

$$
P=V I=(I R) I=I^{2} R
$$

$$
P=V I=V(V / R)=V^{2} / R
$$

Thus, we have three equations for calculating the power dissipated in a resistor.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P=V I, \quad P=I^{2} R \\
& P=V^{2} / R
\end{aligned}
$$

If $V$ Is expressed in volts and $I$ in amperes, the power is expressed in watts.

### 9.15 ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE (EMF) AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE

We know that a source of electrical energy, say a cell or a battery, when connected across a resistance, maintains a steady current through it Fig. 9.25. The cell

continuously supplies energy which is dissipated in the resistance of the circuit. Suppose when a steady current has been established in the circuit, a charge $Q$ passes through any cross-section of the circuit in time $t$. During the course of motion, this charge enters the cell at its low potential end and leaves at its high potential end. The source must supply energy $W$ to the positive charge to compel it to go to the point of high potential. The emf $E$ of the source is defined as the energy supplied to unit charge by the cell.
i.e.,

$$
E=\frac{W}{Q}
$$

Fig. 9.25: Electromotive force of a cell

It may be noted that electromotive force is not a force and we do not measure it in newtons. The unit of emf is joule/coulomb which is volt (V). The energy supplied by the cell to the charge carriers is derived from the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy inside the cell.
Like other components in a circuit, a cell also offers some resistance. This resistance is due to the electrolyte present between the two electrodes of the cell and is called the internal resistance of the cell. Thus, a cell of emf $E$ having an internal resistance $r$ is equivalent to a source of pure emf $E$ with a resistance $r$ in series as shown in Fig. 9.26.
Let us consider the performance of a cell of emf $E$ and internal resistance $r$ as shown in Fig.9.27. A voltmeter of infinite resistance measures the potential difference across the external resistance $R$ or the potential difference $V$ across the terminals of the cell. The current $I$ flowing through the circuit is given by

$$
I=\frac{E}{R+r}
$$

$$
\text { or } E=I R+I r \ldots \ldots \ldots(9.45)
$$

Here $I R=V$ is the terminal potential difference of the cell in the presence of current $I$. When the switch $S$ is open, no current passes through the resistance. In this case, the voltmeter reads the emf $E$ as terminal voltage. Thus, terminal voltage in the presence of the current (switch ON) would be less than the emf Eby Ir.
A voltmeter connected across the terminals of a cell measures: (a) the emf of the cell on open circuit,
(b) the tarminal potential difference on a closed circuit.

Let us interpret the Eq. 9.45 on energy considerations. The left side of this equation is the emf $E$ of the cell which is equal to energy gained by unit charge as it passes through the cell from its negative to positive terminal. The right side of the equation gives an account of the utilization of this energy as the current passes the circuit. It states that, as a unit charge passes through the circuit, a part of this energy equal to irle dissipated into the cell and the rest of the energy is dissipated into the external resistance $R$. It is given by potential drop $I R$. Thus, the emf gives the energy supplied to unit charge by the cell and the potential drop across the various elements account for the dissipation of this energy into other forms as the unit charge passes through these elements.
The emf is the "cause" and potential difference is its "effect". The emf is always present even when no current is drawn through the battery or the cell, but the potential difference across the conductor is zero when no current flows through it.
Example 9.10 The potential difference between the terminals of a battery in open circuit is 2.2 V . When it is connected across a resistance of $5.0 \Omega$, the potential falls to 1.8 V . Calculate the current and the internal resistance of the battery.

Solution

$$
E=2.2 \mathrm{~V}, \quad R=5.0 \Omega, \quad V=1.8 \mathrm{~V}
$$

We have to calculate $I$ and $r$
Using

$$
V=I R \quad \text { or } \quad I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{1.8 \mathrm{~V}}{5.0 \Omega}=0.36 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Internal resistance $r$ can be calculated by using

$$
\begin{aligned}
E & =V+i r \\
2.2 V & =1.8 \mathrm{~V}+0.36 \mathrm{Ax} r
\end{aligned}
$$

or
$r=1.1 \Omega$

# 9.16 KIRCHHOFF'S RULES

Kirchhoff's rules are two fundamental principles in circuit analysis that help to determine the current and voltage in electrical circuits. They are particularly useful for analysing complex circuits that cannot be simplified by Ohm's law and series or parallel combinations.

## Kirchhoff's First Rule

It states that the sum of all the currents meeting at a point in the circuit is zero.
i.e., $\quad 27=0$
It is a convention that a current flowing towards a point is taken as positive and that flowing away from a point is taken as negative.

For your information
A node is a point in an electric circuit which joins the two or more branches.

Consider a situation where four wires meet at a point $A$ (Fig.9.28). The currents flowing into the point $A$ sre $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ and currents flowing away from the point are $I_{3}$ and $I_{4}$.
According to the convention, currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are positive and currents $I_{3}$ and $I_{4}$ are negative. Applying Eq. 9.48 , we have

$$
I_{1}+I_{2}+\left(-I_{3}\right)+\left(-I_{4}\right)=0
$$

or

$$
I_{1}+I_{2}=I_{3}+I_{4}
$$

Using Eq.9.47, Kirchhoff's first rule can be stated in other words as:

The sum of all the currents flowing towards a point is equal to the sum of all the currents flowing away from the point.
Fig. 9.28: According to Kirchhoff's $1^{\text {st }}$ rule $I_{1}+I_{2}=I_{3}+I_{4}$

## Deved know?

The node at which potential is taken as zero is called datum node or reference node.

Kirchhoff's first rule which is also known as Kirchhoff's point rule is a manifestation of law of conservation of charge. If there is no sink or source of charge at a point, the total charge flowing towards the point must be equal to the total charge flowing away from it.

# Kirchhoff's Second Rule

It states that the algebraic sum of voltage changes in a closed circuit or a loop must be equal to zero. Consider a closed circuit shown in Fig. 9.29. The direction of the current / flowing through the circuit depends on the cell having the greater emf. Suppose $E_{1}$ is greater than $E_{2}$, so the current flows in counter clockwise direction. We know that a steady current is equivalent to a continuous flow of positive charges through the circuit. We also know that a voltage change or potential difference is equal to the work done on a unit positive charge or energy gained or lost by it in moving from one point to the other. Thus, when a positive charge $Q$ due to the current $I$ in the closed circuit (Fig.9.29), passes through the cell $E_{1}$ from low (-ve) to high potential ( +ve ), it gains energy because work is done on it. Using Eq. 9.44 the energy gain is $E_{1} Q$. When the current passes through the cell $E_{2}$, it loses energy equal to $-E_{2} Q$ because here the charge passes from high to low potential. In going through the resistor $R_{1}$, the charge $Q$ loses energy equal to $-I R_{1} Q$ where $I R_{1}$ is potential difference across $R_{1}$. The minus sign shows that the charge is passing from high to low potential. Similarly, the loss of energy while passing through the resistor $R_{2}$ is $-I R_{2} Q$. Finally, the charge reaches the negative terminal of the cell $E_{2}$ from where we started. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total change in energy of our system is zero. Therefore, we can write:

$$
E_{1} Q-I R_{1} Q-E_{2} Q-I R_{2} Q=0
$$

or

$$
E_{1}-I R_{1}-E_{2}-I R_{2}=0
$$

Fig. 9.29: According to Kirchhoff's $2^{\text {nd }}$ rule $E_{1}-I R_{1}-E_{2}-I R_{2}=0$

which is Kirchhoff's second rule and it states that:
The algebraic sum of potential changes in a closed circuit is zero.
We have seen that this rule is simply a particular way of stating the law of conservation of energy in electrical problems.
Before applying this rule for the analysis of complex network, it is worthwhile to thoroughly understand the rules for finding the potential changes.
(i) If a source of emf is traversed from positive to negative terminal, the potential change is positive. It is negative in the opposite direction.
(ii) If a resistor is traversed in the direction of current, the change in potential is positive. It is negative in the opposite direction.
Example 9.11 Calculate the currents in the three resistances of the circuit shown in Fig. 9.30.

# Solution

First we select two loops abcda and ebcfe. The choice of loops is quite arbitrary, but it should be such that each resistance is included at least once in the selected loops.
Fig. 9.30

After selecting the loops, suppose a current $I_{1}$ is flowing in the first loop and $I_{2}$ in the second loop, all flowing in the same sense. These currents are called loop currents. The actual currents will be calculated with their help. It should be noted that the sense of the current flowing in all loops should essentially be the same. It may be clockwise or anticlockwise. Here we have assumed it to be clockwise.
We now apply Kirchhoff's second rule to obtain the equations required to calculate the currents through the resistances. We first consider the loop abcda. Starting at point a we follow the loop clockwise. The voltage change while crossing the battery $E_{1}$ is $-E_{1}$ because the current flows through it from positive to negative. The voltage change across $R_{1}$ is $-I_{1} R_{1}$. The resistance $R_{2}$ is common to both the loops $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$, therefore, the currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ simultaneously flow through it. The directions of currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ as flowing through $R_{2}$ are opposite, so we have to decide that which of these currents is to be assigned a positive sign. The convention regarding the sign of the current is that if we are applying the Kirchhoff's second rule in the first loop, then the current of this loop i.e., $I_{1}$ will be assigned a positive sign and all currents flowing opposite to $I_{1}$ have a negative sign. Similarly, while applying Kirchhoff's second rule in the second loop, the current $I_{2}$ will be considered as positive and $I_{1}$ as negative. Using this convention the current

flowing through $R_{2}$ is $\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right)$ and the voltage change across is $-\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) R_{2}$. The voltage change across the battery $E_{2}$ is $E_{2}$. Thus, the Kirchhoff's second rule as applied to the loop abode gives

$$
-E_{1}-I_{1} R_{1}-\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) R_{2}+E_{2}=0
$$

Substituting the values, we have

$$
\begin{gathered}
-40 \mathrm{~V}-I_{1} \times 10 \Omega-\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) \times 30 \Omega+60 \mathrm{~V}=0 \\
20 \mathrm{~V}-10 \Omega \times\left[I_{1}+3\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right)\right]=0 \\
4 I_{1}-3 I_{2}=2 \mathrm{~V} \Omega^{1}=2 \mathrm{~A} \\
4 I_{1}-3 I_{2}=2 \mathrm{~V} \Omega^{1}=2 \mathrm{~A}
\end{gathered}
$$

Similarly, applying Kirchhoff's second rule to the loop ebote, we have

$$
-E_{2}-\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\right) R_{2}-I_{2} R_{2}+E_{2}=0
$$

Substituting the values

$$
\begin{gathered}
-60 \mathrm{~V}-\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\right) \times 30 \Omega-I_{2} \times 15 \Omega+50 \mathrm{~V}=0 \\
-10 \mathrm{~V}-15 \Omega \times\left[I_{2}+2\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\right)\right]=0 \\
6 I_{1}-9 I_{2}=2 \mathrm{~V} \Omega^{1}=2 \mathrm{~A}
\end{gathered}
$$

Solving Eq.(i) and Eq. (ii) for $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$, we have

$$
I_{1}=0.86 \AA \text { and } I_{2}=0.22 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Knowing the value of loop currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ the actual current flowing through each resistance of the circuit can be determined. Fig. 9.29 shows that $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are the actual currents through the resistances $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. The actual current through $R_{2}$ is the difference of $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ and its direction is along the larger current. Thus,
The current through $R_{1}=I_{1}=2 / 3 A=0.66$ A flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from a to d.
The current through $R_{2}=I_{1}-I_{2}=2 / 3 A-2 / 9 A=0.44$ A flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from cto b.
The current through $R_{2}=I_{2}=2 / 9 A=0.22$ A flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from $f$ to e.

# Procedures of Solution of Circuit Problems

After solving the above problem, we are in a position to apply the same procedure to analyse other direct current complex networks. While using Kirchhoff's rules in other problems, it is worthwhile to follow the approach given below:
(i) Draw the circuit diagram.
(ii) The choice of loops should be such that each resistance is included at least once in the selected loops.
(iii) Assume a loop current in each loop. All the loop currents should be in the same sense. It may be either clockwise or anticlockwise.
(iv) Write the loop equations for all the selected loops. For writing each loop equation, the voltage change across any component is positive if traversed from low to high

potential and it is negative if traversed from high to low potential.
(v) Solve these equations for the unknown quantities.

# 9.17 WHEATSTONE BRIDGE

It is an electric circuit. The Wheatstone bridge circuit shown in Fig. 9.31 consists of four resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ connected in such a way so as to form a mesh ABCDA. A battery is connected between points $A$ and $C$. A sensitive galvanometer of resistance $R_{2}$ is connected between points $B$ and $D$. If the switch $S$ is closed, a current will flow through the galvanometer. We have to determine the condition under which no current flows through the galvanometer even after the switch is closed. For this purpose, we analyse this circuit using Kirchhoff's second rule. We consider two loops ABDA and BCDB and assume anticlockwise loop currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ through the loops respectively. The Kirchhoff's second rule as applied to loop ABDA gives:
Fig. 9.31: Wheatstone bridge circuit

$$
-I_{1} R_{1}-\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) R_{2}-I_{1} R_{3}=0
$$

Similarly, by applying the Kirchhoff's second rule to loop BCDB, we have

$$
-I_{2} R_{2}-I_{1} R_{1}-\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\right) R_{2}=0
$$

The current flowing through the galvanometer will be zero if, $I_{1}-I_{2}=0$ or $I_{1}=I_{2}$. With this condition Eq. 9.51 and Eq. 9.52 reduce to:

$$
-I_{2} R_{2}=I_{1} R_{3}
$$

and

$$
-I_{3} R_{2}=I_{1} R_{4}
$$

Dividing Eq. 9.48 by Eq. 9.49, we have

$$
\frac{-I_{1} R_{1}}{-I_{2} R_{2}}=\frac{I_{1} R_{3}}{I_{2} R_{4}}
$$

As $I_{1}=I_{2}$, therefore,

$$
\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{4}}
$$

## Point to ponder!

Why is a three pin plug used in some electric appliances?

Thus, whenever the condition of Eq. 9.54 is satisfied, no current flows through the galvanometer and it shows no deflection, or conversely when the galvanometer in the Wheatstone bridge circuit shows no deflection, Eq. 9.54 is satisfied. If we connect three

resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ of known adjustable values and a fourth resistance $R_{4}$ of unknown value and the resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ are so adjusted that the galvanometer shows no deflection, then from the known resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$, the unknown resistance $R_{4}$ can be determined by using Eq. 9.54.

# 9.18 POTENTIOMETER

A potentiometer is mainly used to compare potential differences and to find the value of an unknown resistance. It works on the principle of Wheatslone Bridge.

## Working of Potentiometer

Potential difference is usually measured by an instrument called a voltmeter. The voltmeter is connected across the two points in a circuit between which potential difference is to be measured. It is necessary that the resistance of the voltmeter be large compared to the circuit resistance across which the voltmeter is connected. Otherwise, an appreciable current will flow through the voltmeter which will alter the circuit current and the potential difference to be measured. Thus, the voltmeter can read the correct potential difference only when it does not draw any current from the circuit across which it is connected. An ideal voltmeter would have an infinite resistance.
However, there are some potential measuring instruments such as digital voltmeter and cathode-ray oscilloscope which practically do not draw any current from the circuit because of their large resistance and are thus very accurate potential measuring instruments. But these instruments are very expensive. A very simple instrument which can measure and compare potential differences accurately is a potentiometer.
A potentiometer consists of a resistor $R$ in the form of a wire on which a terminal $C$ can slide (Fig. 9.32-a). The resistance between $A$ and $C$ can be varied from 0 to $R$ as the sliding contact $C$ is moved from $A$ to $B$. If a battery of emf $E$ is connected across $R$ (Fig. 9.32-b) the current flowing through it is $I=E / R$. If we represent the resistance between $A$ and $C$ by $r$, the potential drop between these points will be $r I=r E / R$. Thus, as $C$ is moved from $A$ to $B, r$ varies from 0 to $R$ and the potential drop between $A$ and $C$ changes from 0 to $E$.
Such an arrangement also known as potential divider can be used to measure the unknown emf of a source by using the circuit shown in Fig. 9.33. Here $R$ is in the form of a straight wire of uniform area of cross-section. A source of potential, say a cell whose emf $E_{x}$ is to be
Fig. 9.32

measured, is connected between $A$ and the sliding contact $C$ through a galvanometer $G$. It should be noted that the positive terminal of $E_{x}$ and that of the potential divider are connected to the same point $A$. If, in the loop AGCA, the point $C$ and the negative terminal of $E_{x}$ are at the same potential, then the two terminals of the galvanometer will be at the same potential and no current will flow through the galvanometer. Therefore, to measure the potential $E_{x}$, the position of $C$ is so adjusted that the galvanometer shows no deflection. Under this
Fig. 9.33
condition, the emf $E_{x}$, of the cell is equal to the potential difference between $A$ and $C$ whose value $E_{x} / R$ is known. In case of a wire of uniform cross-section, the resistance is proportional to the length of the wire. Therefore, the unknown emf is also given by

$$
E_{x}=E \frac{\ell}{R}=E \frac{\ell}{L}
$$

where $L$ is the total length of the wire $A B$ and $\ell$ is its length from $A$ to $C$, after $C$ has been adjusted for no deflection. As the maximum potential that can be obtained between $A$ and $C$ is $E$, so the unknown emf $E_{x}$ should not exceed this value, otherwise the null condition will not be obtained. It can be seen that the unknown emf $E_{x}$ is determined when no current is drawn from it and therefore, potentiometer is one of the most accurate methods for measuring potential.
The method for measuring the emf of a cell as described above can be used to compare the emfs $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ of two cells. The balancing lengths $\ell$, and $\ell_{2}$ are found separately for the two cells. Then,

$$
E_{1}=E \frac{\ell_{1}}{L} \text { and } E_{2}=E \frac{\ell_{2}}{L}
$$

Dividing these two equations, we have

$$
\frac{E_{1}}{E_{2}}=\frac{\ell}{\ell_{2}}
$$

So, the ratio of the emfs is equal to ratio of the balancing lengths.

# 9.19 USE OF A GALVANOMETER

A galvanometer is an instrument for detecting a current. We are not going to discuss its internal structure and how does it work. We focus only on its use. It is often used in null methods to achieve precise measurements in electrical circuits. The null method involves adjusting the circuit until the galvanometer shows no deflection i.e., a zero reading. This indicates that certain required conditions are met in the circuit. In this state, the electric potentials at both ends of the galvanometer are the same. Although a galvanometer has its own resistance, but at the null reading, its resistance does not

come into play. The reason is that, in this condition no current is passing through it. The null method is widely used in bridge circuits such as Wheatstone and potentiometer setups.
As we have studied in the previous section, the null method is used to measure an unknown resistance in the Wheatstone bridge circuits. The galvanometer is connected between the mid-points of opposite sides. The variable resistance is adjusted until the galvanometer shows no deflection. At this point, the bridge is balanced and the unknown resistance can be calculated using the ratio of the known resistances.
In a potentiometer, null method is used to measure an unknown voltage by comparison with a known reference voltage applied across the resistance wire of the potentiometer. A galvanometer and a jockey are used to make contact along the wire. At null point, the potential difference between the jockey and the end of the wire equals the unknown voltage. The position of the jockey gives the measure of the unknown voltage.
There are some advantages of using a galvanometer in null method.

1. Null method, eliminates the effect of the galvanometer's internal resistance on the measurement resulting in more accurate readings.
2. Galvanometers are highly sensitive and can detect very small currents of the order of $10^{4}$ ampere.
3. "No deflection" indicates a direct and clear condition of balance making it easier to identify the null point.

# 9.20 THERMISTORS

A thermistor is a heat sensitive resistor. Most thermistors have negative temperature coefficient of resistance, i.e., the resistance of such thermistors decreases when their temperature is increased. Thermistors with positive temperature coefficient are also available.
In the thermistors, resistance decreases as temperature increases. This is because increasing temperature provides more energy to the charge carriers (electrons or holes), enabling them to move more freely and thus reducing resistance.
Thermistors are made by heating under high pressure semiconductor ceramic made from mixtures of metallic oxides of manganese, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron, etc. These are pressed into desired shapes and
Fig. 9.34: Thermistors syambols
Fig. 9.35: Types of thermistors

then baked at high temperature. Different types of thermistors are shown in Fig. 9.34. They may be in the form of beads, rods or washers.

# Applications of Thermistors

## Temperature Measurement

Thermistors are used in thermometers, and electric devices such as air conditioners, refrigerators, heaters, microwave ovens, incubators, etc.to monitor temperature.
Thermistors with high negative temperature coefficient are very accurate for measuring low temperatures especially near 10 K . The higher resistance at low temperature enables more accurate measurement possible.
Thermistors have wide applications as temperature sensors, i.e. they convert changes of temperature into electrical voltage which is duly processed. For example, these are used in coolant temperature sensors in automobile engines to prevent the engine overheating and in digital thermometers.

## Temperature Compensation

Thermistors are used in circuits where temperature changes could affect performance. Such as in oscillators, battery charging circuits and power systems.

## Inrush Current Limiting

Thermistors are used to limit the initial flow of current when a device is first turned on.

## Voltage Divider

Thermistors are widely used as voltage divider. As shown in Fig. 9.36 when temperature of a thermistor increases, its resistance decreases. This decreases the voltage drop across the thermistor. As a result, the potential at point B increases that can be used to trigger a circuit connected to it. In case of a fire alarm, the use of a thermistor turns the NOT gate low when it
gets heated. The output of NOT gate goes high and
turns the siren ON

### 9.21 LIGHT DEPENDENT RESISTOR

Light dependent resistor (LDR) is a resistor whose resistance decreases with increasing light intensity. Due to this property, it is also known as photo resistor. The LDRs are typically made from semiconductor material like cadmium sulphide. The material is deposited in a special pattern on an insulating plate.

## Working Principle

The principle used in an LDR is the increase in the conductivity of the material on exposing it to light. In darkness, the semiconductor material has a few free electrons (charge carriers) resulting in high resistance. When light photons hit the material, they

transfer energy to electrons in the outer orbits, thus, making them free to conduct electricity. This decreases the resistance of LDR. The amount of light hitting the LDR's surface determines the number of free elections. Conversely, less light results in lowering the free elections, thus, making higher resistance. This change in resistance can be measured and used in circuits to sense light levels.

# Applications of LDRs

## Light Sensors

LDRs are commonly used in light sensing circuits such as automatic lighting systems in homes and street lights. An LDR works just like a switch that turns ON at dusk and OFF at dawn.

## Camera Exposure Control

LDRs help in adjusting the exposure time in cameras based on the amount of available light.

## Voltage Divider

In a typical circuit, an LDR can be a part of voltage divider, that converts the resistance change into measurable voltage change. This voltage can then be read by a microcontroller or other control circuitry to perform actions based on light levels. A circuit is shown in Fig. 9.37 in which an LDR is used as voltage divider. In the dark, the LDR has a very high resistance as compared to the standard resistance ( 100 kD ) in the circuit. Therefore the voltage drop across the LDR is very large as registered by a voltmeter. When the LDR is exposed to light, the resistance of LDR decreases to very low. Now, the voltmeter registers a lower reading. Hence, the change in light intensity gives rise to change in voltage. Therefore, by connecting mid-point B to a NOT gate, LDR can be used as a switch.

## Reliability of A Concrete Bridge

Inspectors can easily check the reliability of concrete bridge with the help of carbon fibers embedded in its slab. This is possible because of the conducting property of the carbon fibers. Let us know step by step how does it work?

1. First step is to know the electrical properties of carbon fibers. Carbon fibers are known to be good conductors of electricity due to their high carbon content.
2. Secondly, we can embed the carbon fibers within the slab of the concrete bridge during its construction.
Fig. 9.37
Fig. 9.38: Carbon fibre sheets

Then we can connect them to form a conductors network.
3. Inspectors can check the reliability of the concrete bridge by applying small electric current to the carbon fiber network. They can determine the integrity of the concrete structure by measuring the resistance of the network.
4. The sensor installed into the network can show whether the electric resistance is changing or not. If the resistance remains the same over time, it indicates that the concrete bridge is maintaining its structural integrity. However, if the resistance increases, it means that the concrete is deteriorating or that the carbon fibers are being damaged.
Some other methods are also used to check the strength of the concrete bridge. For example, a type of sensors continuously monitor strain, vibration and temperature. Internal flaws, such as cracks or voids are detected by using ultrasound waves.
