### 9.21 LIGHT DEPENDENT RESISTOR

Light dependent resistor (LDR) is a resistor whose resistance decreases with increasing light intensity. Due to this property, it is also known as photo resistor. The LDRs are typically made from semiconductor material like cadmium sulphide. The material is deposited in a special pattern on an insulating plate.

## Working Principle

The principle used in an LDR is the increase in the conductivity of the material on exposing it to light. In darkness, the semiconductor material has a few free electrons (charge carriers) resulting in high resistance. When light photons hit the material, they

transfer energy to electrons in the outer orbits, thus, making them free to conduct electricity. This decreases the resistance of LDR. The amount of light hitting the LDR's surface determines the number of free elections. Conversely, less light results in lowering the free elections, thus, making higher resistance. This change in resistance can be measured and used in circuits to sense light levels.

# Applications of LDRs

## Light Sensors

LDRs are commonly used in light sensing circuits such as automatic lighting systems in homes and street lights. An LDR works just like a switch that turns ON at dusk and OFF at dawn.

## Camera Exposure Control

LDRs help in adjusting the exposure time in cameras based on the amount of available light.

## Voltage Divider

In a typical circuit, an LDR can be a part of voltage divider, that converts the resistance change into measurable voltage change. This voltage can then be read by a microcontroller or other control circuitry to perform actions based on light levels. A circuit is shown in Fig. 9.37 in which an LDR is used as voltage divider. In the dark, the LDR has a very high resistance as compared to the standard resistance ( 100 kD ) in the circuit. Therefore the voltage drop across the LDR is very large as registered by a voltmeter. When the LDR is exposed to light, the resistance of LDR decreases to very low. Now, the voltmeter registers a lower reading. Hence, the change in light intensity gives rise to change in voltage. Therefore, by connecting mid-point B to a NOT gate, LDR can be used as a switch.

## Reliability of A Concrete Bridge

Inspectors can easily check the reliability of concrete bridge with the help of carbon fibers embedded in its slab. This is possible because of the conducting property of the carbon fibers. Let us know step by step how does it work?

1. First step is to know the electrical properties of carbon fibers. Carbon fibers are known to be good conductors of electricity due to their high carbon content.
2. Secondly, we can embed the carbon fibers within the slab of the concrete bridge during its construction.
Fig. 9.37
Fig. 9.38: Carbon fibre sheets

Then we can connect them to form a conductors network.
3. Inspectors can check the reliability of the concrete bridge by applying small electric current to the carbon fiber network. They can determine the integrity of the concrete structure by measuring the resistance of the network.
4. The sensor installed into the network can show whether the electric resistance is changing or not. If the resistance remains the same over time, it indicates that the concrete bridge is maintaining its structural integrity. However, if the resistance increases, it means that the concrete is deteriorating or that the carbon fibers are being damaged.
Some other methods are also used to check the strength of the concrete bridge. For example, a type of sensors continuously monitor strain, vibration and temperature. Internal flaws, such as cracks or voids are detected by using ultrasound waves.
