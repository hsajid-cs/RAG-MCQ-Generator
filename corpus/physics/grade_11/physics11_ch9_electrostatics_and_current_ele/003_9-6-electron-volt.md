### 9.6 ELECTRON VOLT

We know that when a particle of charge $q$ moves from point $A$ at potential $V_{A}$ to a point $B$ at potential $V_{B}$ keeping electrostatic equilibrium, the change in potential energy $\Lambda U$ of particle is:

$$
\Delta U=q\left(V_{B}-V_{A}\right)=q \Delta V
$$

If no external force acts on the charge to maintain equilibrium, this change in P.E. appears in the form of change in $K . E$.
Suppose charge carried by the particle is $q=e=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$.
Thus, in this case, the energy acquired by the charge will be:

$$
\Delta K . E .-q \Delta V-e \Delta V-\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right)(\Delta V)
$$

Moreover, assume that $\Delta V=1$ volt, hence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta K . E .=q \Delta V=\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right) \times(1 \mathrm{volt}) \\
& \Delta K . E .=\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right) \times(\mathrm{CxV})=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

The amount of energy equal to $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}$ is called one electron-volt and is denoted by 1 eV . It is defined as "the amount of energy acquired or lost by an electron as it traverses a potential difference of one volt". Thus,

$$
1 \mathrm{eV}=1.6 \times 10^{19} \mathrm{~J}
$$

Example 9.6 A particle carrying a charge of $2 e$ falls through a potential difference of 3.0 V . Calculate the energy required by it.

$$
\text { Solution } \quad q=2 e, \Delta V=3.0 \mathrm{~V}
$$

The energy acquired by the particle is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta U=q \Delta V & =(2 e)(3.0 \mathrm{~V})=6.0 \mathrm{eV} \\
\Delta U & =6.0 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}=9.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 9.7 MOTION OF CHAROED PARTICLES IN A UNIFORM ELECTRIC FIELD

Two oppositely charged parallel metal plates produce uniform electric field between them. The direction of electricfieid is from positive to negative plate. A positive charge $+q$ placed in the field will move in the direction of electric field whereas a negative charge $-q$ will move opposite to the electric field. The magnitude of electric force acting on a charge qis represented in Fig 9.18 given by

$$
F=q E
$$

where $E$ is the electric intensity of the uniform electric field. If $V$ is the potential difference between the plates and $d$ is the separation of plates, then

$$
E=\frac{V}{d}
$$

Fig. 9.18

To understand the effect of uniform electric field on the motion of charged particles, let us consider an electron placed between the two plates. The electron accelerates towards the positive plate due to a force $F$ acting on it.

For example, let $V=20 \mathrm{~V}, d=2.0 \mathrm{~cm}=2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}$, the magnitude of $E$ will be:

$$
E=\frac{V}{d}=\frac{20 \mathrm{~V}}{2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}}=1000 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{C}^{-1}
$$

The acceleration for the electron will be given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=m a \\
& a=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{q E}{m}
\end{aligned}
$$

The charge on an electron $q=e=1.6 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{C}$ and mass of electron $m=9.1 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{~kg}$. So,

$$
a=\frac{1.6 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{C} \times 1000 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{C}^{-1}}{9.1 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{~kg}}=1.76 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2}
$$

If the electron is released from the negative plate, the velocity gained by it when it reaches positive plate can be found by the third equation of mation.

$$
2 a S=v_{f}^{2}-v_{f}^{2}
$$

Here

$$
S=d=2 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~m}, v_{1}=0, v_{2}=v=?
$$

Putting the values in the above equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 \times 1.76 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \times 2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}=v^{2} \\
& v^{2}=7.04 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
& v=2.65 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 9.8 PATH OF A CHARGED PARTICLE

The path of a charged particle is determined by the electric field in the region. The path is typically straight if the field is uniform and the charged particle is moving along the field. However, if a charged particle enters perpendicularly to the uniform field between the oppositely charged parallel plates with a certain velocity as shown in Fig. 9.19, it will not go straight. Its path will be parabolic just like a projectile thrown horizontally in the gravitational field. The horizontal component of the velocity of the charged particle remains constant whereas vertical component is accelerated due to the electric force.
Figure 9.19 shows that a positivity charged particle is attracted towards the negatively charged plate and thus undergoes deflection in that direction.

On the other hand, a negatively charged particle is attracted towards the positively charged plate and experiences deflection in that direction.

# 9.9 SHIELDING FROM EXTERNAL ELECTRIC FIELD

An English scientist Michael Faraday invented a structure in 1836, called Faraday cage or Faraday shield. Faraday cage is an enclosure that blocks the external electric fields in conductive materials. It acts like a hollow conductor where devices or objects can be put for protection from electrical external fields. Any electrical shock received by the cage runs through its outer surface without causing any harm inside. The electric field inside the hollow conductor remains zero.
To understand the working of Faraday cage, suppose that a piece of conductor (say copper) carries a number of free electrons. Each electron will experience a force of repulsion because of the electric field of its neighbouring electrons. As a consequence, all the electrons rush to the surface of the conductor. Once static equilibrium is established with all of the excess charges on the surface, no further movement of charge occurs. If some electrons shift from the conductor to another object due to friction etc., a net positive charge appears on the surface of the conductor. We can say,

At equilibrium under electrostatic conditions, any
excess charge resides on the surface of a conductor.
Now consider the interior of the hollow conductor. The excess charges arrange themselves on the conductor's surface precisely in the manner that the total field within the interior becomes zero. In other words,
The conductor shields any charge within it from electric fields outside the conductor.
To eliminate the interference of external fields, circuits are often enclosed within metal boxes that provide shielding from such fields.
Figure 9.20 shows another aspect of how conductors alter the electric field lines created by external charges.
Fig. 9.20

The lines are altered because the electric field just outside the surface of a conductor is perpendicular to the surface at equilibrium under electrostatic conditions. If the field were not perpendicular, there would be a component of the field parallel to the surface. Since the free electrons on the surface of the conductor can move, they would do so under the force exerted by the parallel component. But in reality, no electron flow occurs at equilibrium. Therefore, there can be no parallel component, and the electric field is perpendicular to the surface.
The principle of Faraday cage demands a material that contains a lot of free electrons that can move freely to the surface of the material. Only the conductors have free

electrons whereas insulators do not contain free electron, so the insulators can not be used to construct Faraday cage.
A good example of Faraday cage in our daily life is that of cars. The chassis and bodies of cars protect people inside due to its metal framed structure during the thunderstorms. The electrical charge travels over the metal surface of the vehicle into the ground and prevent the passengers inside.
A metal body of the microwave oven acts as a Faraday cage. Thus, they prevent the microwaves in an oven from expanding into the environment. Metal frame of an airplane also acts as a Faraday cage. When lightning strikes an airplane, electricity is distributed along its metal frame surface that keeps passengers and all devices inside the airplane safe.

# 9.10 ELECTRIC CURRENT

Usually, it is said that electric current is the flow of charge. Let us see what actually flows in a conductor. The charge carriers are the free electrons. When the ends of a conductor are connected to a battery or some other source of potential, an electric field is set up at every point within the conductor. The free electrons experience a force in the direction of -E and they start moving. As the free electrons are bumping among the atoms, so they are not accelerated in a straight line under this force. They keep on colliding with the atoms of the conductor. The overall effect of these collisions is to transfer the energy of accelerated eletrons to the lattice with the result that the electrons acquire an average velocity, called the drift velocity in the direction of -E . The drift velocity is of the order of $10^{-4} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This drift velocity of electrons forms the electric current. The slow drift velocity does not mean that it takes long time for an electric current to set up. We know that as soon as we switch ON a bulb, itlitup immediately.
The reason is that on turning the switch ON, all the free electrons in the circuit start drifting. They repel the neighbouring ones and the disturbance propagates along the wire almost instantaneously. That is why, the electric current is set up very rapidly.
If a net charge $Q$ passes through any cross-section of a conductor in time $t$, the current $I$ flowing through it is:

$$
I=\frac{Q}{T}
$$

The SI unit of current is ampere (A) and it is the current due to flow of one coulomb charge per second through any cross-section of a conductor. If the charges move around a circuit in the same direction at all times, the current is said to be direct current (D.C). For example, batteries produce direct current. If the charges move first one way and then the opposite way, changing direction in regular intervals, the current is said to be alternating current (A.C). Mostly the electric generators produce A.C. The electricity supplied to our homes, offices, factories etc., by power stations is an A.C.

## Conventional Current

As we now understand, the electric current is due to flow of electrons through the metal

wires, but early scientists believed that electric current was due to flow of positive charges. The scientists have kept the convention and take the direction of current flow to be the direction in which positive charges would move. We call it conventional current.

Conventional current is hypothetical flow of positive charges that would have the same effect in the circuit as the flow of negative charges that actually does occur.

In Fig. 9.21, negative electrons arrive at the positive terminal of the battery. The same effect would have been achieved if an equivalent amount of positive charge has left the positive terminal. Therefore, we can say that the conventional current flows from positive terminal towards the negative terminal of a battery. A conventional current is consistent with our earlier use of a positive test charge for
defining electric fields and potential. The direction of conventional current is always from a point of higher potential towards a point of lower potential that is from the positive terminal towards the negative terminal. Now onward the current / always means the conventional current.

# 9.11 CURRENT THROUGH A CONDUCTOR

Consider a segment of the current carrying conductor having length $L$ and area of crosssection $A$. The volume of the segment is $A L$, as represented in Fig. 9.22. Let $n$ be the number of charge carriers per unit volume, then total number of charge carriers in the segment at any time are $n A L$. If the charge on a charge carrier is $q$, the total change present
Fig. 9.22: Negative charge carriers
inside the segment at any instant is:

$$
Q=n A L q
$$

Usually, the charge carriers in a conductor are free electrons which have negative charge.
Suppose that charge carriers move towards left face of the segment when a potential difference is applied across the conductor. Then electric current is set up in the conductor directed towards right face. Assuming that drift velocity of the charge carries to be $v$, the time taken $t$ by all the charge carriers originally present in the

## Flow of current is directly proportional to the potential difference.
Flow of heat is directly proportional to the temperature difference.
Flow of fluid is directly proportional to the pressure difference.

## For your information?

Current is a flow of charge, pressured into motion by voltage and hampered by resistance.

segment to exit through the left face will be:
By definition of the current

$$
\begin{aligned}
& t=\frac{L}{v} \\
& i=\frac{Q}{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the value of $Q$ and $t$ in the above equation, we have

$$
i=\frac{n A L q}{L_{v}}
$$

or

$$
I=n A v q
$$

(1) Example 9.7 A copper wire has a cross-sectional area of $2 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and carries a current of 3 A . If the number of elections per unit volume is $8.5 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$, calculate the drift velocity of the electrons in the wire. Charge on an electron is $1.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{C}$.
