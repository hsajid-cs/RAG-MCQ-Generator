### 9.1 COULOMB'S LAW

Coulomb's law is a fundamental principle in electrostatics that quantifies the force between two charged objects. The first measurement of the force between electric charges was made by a French Physicist Charles de Coulomb in 1874. Coulomb's law is essential in understanding the behaviour of charged particles and the interactions that govern many electrical phenomena. On the basis of these measurements, he deduced a law known as Coulomb's law. It states that:
The force between two-point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. It is mathematically expressed as
Fig. 9.1
(a) Repulsive forces between like charges and
(b) attractive forces between unlike charges.

$$
F \propto \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \text { or } \quad F=k \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$

where $F$ is the magnitude of the mutual force that acts on each of the two point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}$, and $r$ is the distance between them. The force $F$ always acts along the line joining the two point charges (Fig. 9.1), $k$ is the constant of proportionality. Its value depends upon the nature of medium between the two charges and system of units in which $F, q$ and $r$ are measured. If the medium between the two point charges is free space and the system of units is SI, then $k$ is represented as

$$
k=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}
$$

where $\varepsilon_{0}$ is an electrical constant, known as permittivity of free space. In SI units, its value is $8.85 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{C}^{2} \mathrm{~N}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Substituting the value of $\varepsilon_{0}$ the constant

$$
k-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}-9 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{2}
$$

Thus, Coulomb's force in free space is

$$
F=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$

## Point to ponder?

Does an electrostatic force exist between a charged and an uncharged?

As stated earlier, Coulombs' force is mutual force, it means that if $q_{1}$ exerts a force on $q_{2}$, then $q_{2}$ also exerts an equal and opposite force on $q_{1}$ if we denote the force exerted on $q_{2}$ by $q_{1}$ as $F_{21}$ and that on charge $q_{1}$ due to $q_{2}$ as $F_{12}$ then

$$
F_{12}=-F_{21}
$$

The magnitude of both these two forces is the same and is given by Eq. 9.3. To represent the direction of these forces, we introduce unit vectors. If $\hat{r}_{21}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{1}$ to $q_{2}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{2}$ to $q_{1}$ then

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F_{21}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21} \\
& F_{12}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

The forces $F_{21}$ and $F_{12}$ are shown in Fig. 9.2 (a and b). It can be seen that $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21}=-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}$, so Eqs. 9.5 and 9.6 show that;

$$
\mathbf{F}_{21}=-\mathbf{F}_{12}
$$

The sign of the charges in Eqs. 9.5 and 9.6 determine whether the forces are attractive or repulsive.
We shall now consider the effect of medium between the two charges upon the Coulomb's force. If the medium is an insulator, it is usually referred as dielectric. It has been found that the presence of a dielectric always reduces the electrostatic force as compared with that in free space by a certain factor which is a constant for the given dielectric. This constant is known as relative permittivity and is represented by $\varepsilon$. The values of relative permittivity of different dielectrics are given in Table 9.1.
Thus, the Coulomb's force in a medium of relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{r}$ is given by

$$
F_{r}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{r}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$

It can be seen in the table that $\varepsilon_{r}$, for air is 1.0006 . This value is so close to one that with negligible error, the Eq. 9.3 gives the electric force in air.

Example 9.3 Three point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}$ and $q_{3}$ are lying in the same plane as shown in Fig. 9.3(a). Find the magnitude and direction of the net fore acting on $q_{1}$.

## Solution

Force on $q_{1}$ exerted by $q_{2}$ is attractive. Let it be $F_{12}$. Its magnitude is given by
Fig. 9.3(a)

$$
F_{12}=k \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r_{2}^{2}}=\frac{\left(9 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{2}\right)\left(40 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(60 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)}{(0.15 \mathrm{~m})^{2}}=960 \mathrm{~N}
$$

Force on $q_{1}$ exerted by $q_{2}$ is also attractive. Let it be $F_{12}$. Its magnitude is given by

$$
F_{12}-k \frac{q_{1} q_{3}}{r_{3}^{2}}-\frac{\left(9 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{Nm}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{2}\right)\left(40 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(50 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)}{\left(0.12 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)}-1250 \mathrm{~N}
$$

To find the resultant of $F_{12}$ and $F_{13}$, let us make free-body diagram, resolving $F_{13}$ into its rectangular components, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F_{13 x}=F_{13} \cos 60^{\circ}=1250 \mathrm{~N} \times 0.5=625 \mathrm{~N} \\
& F_{13 y}=F_{13} \sin 60^{\circ}=1250 \mathrm{~N} \times 0.86=1075 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

The $x$-component of resultant $F$ is

$$
F_{x}=F_{12}+F_{13} \cos 60^{\circ}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F_{x}=960 \mathrm{~N}+625 \mathrm{~N} \\
& F_{x}=1585 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

$y$-component of $F$ is:

$$
F_{y}-F_{12} \sin 60^{\circ}-1075 \mathrm{~N}
$$

Magnitude of $F$ is given by

$$
F=\sqrt{F_{x}^{2}+F_{y}^{2}}=1975 \mathrm{~N}
$$

For direction of $F$ :

$$
\tan 9=\frac{F_{y}}{F_{x}}=\frac{1075}{1585}=0.68
$$

A Van de Graaff generator is an electrostatic generator which uses a moving belt to accumulate electric charge on a hollow metal globe on the top of an insulated column, creating very high voltage direct current (DC) at low current levels. It was invented by an American physicist Robert J. Van de Graff in 1920.
The potential difference achieved in modern Van de Graaff generators can reach 5 megavolts. A tabletop version can produce of the order of 100,000 volts and can produce enough energy to produce a visible spark.
A pulley drives an inauiting belt by a sharply pointed metal comb which has been given a positive charge by a power supply. Electrons are removed from the belt, leaving it positively charged. A similar comb at the top allows the net positive charge to spread to the dome.
Why do the hairs lift when VAN DE GRAAFF GENERATOR is touched?

Therefore, $B=34^{\circ}$ with the line joining $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$.

# 9.2 ELECTRIC FIELD STRENGTH

We have learnt that a charge experiences an electrostatic force in the presence of other charges. Let us consider a positively charged object $Q$. If we place a small charge $+q$ at point $A$, it will experience an electrostatic force $F$ due to the charge $Q$. Thus, an electric field is said to exist at point $A$. Coulomb's law suggests that the field gets stronger as the point $A$ gets closer to $Q$ as represented in Fig. 9.4. The strength of the field at a position is known as its intensity at that point.
Fig. 9.4

The electric intensity of the field or simply electric field at any point is defined as the force experienced by a unit positive charge placed at that point.
Electric intensity is a force, so it is a vector quantity and is usually denoted by $E$. It can be obtained by the relation:

# Physics II

$$
E=\frac{F}{q}
$$

As

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q Q}{r^{2}} \quad \therefore \quad E-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^{2}} \\
& \text { In vector form: } \\
& E=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^{2}} \hat{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

From Eq. 9.8, the unit of electric intensity is newton per coulomb $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$. The direction of $E$ is the same as that of $F$. The Eq. 9.5 can also be written as:

$$
F=q E
$$

Example 9.2 Two positive point charges $q_{1}=16.0 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and $q_{2}=4.0 \mu \mathrm{C}$ are separated by a distance of 3.0 m , as shown in Fig.9.5. Find the spot on the line joining the two charges where electric field is zero.
Fig. 9.5

Solution Between the two charges, the fields contributed by them have opposite directions, and electric field would be zero at a point $P$, where the magnitude of $E_{1}$ equals to $E_{2}$. In Fig. 9.5, let the distance of $P$ from $q_{1}$ be $d$. At $P_{1} E_{2}=E_{2}$ which implies that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1}}{(3.0-d)^{2}}-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{2}}{d^{2}} \\
& \text { or } \quad \frac{16.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}}{9.0+d^{2}-6 d}=\frac{4.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}}{d^{2}} \text { or } d^{2}+2 d-3=0 \text {, which gives } d=+1 \mathrm{~m},-3 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

There are two values of $d$, the negative value corresponds to a location off to the right of both the charges where magnitudes of $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are equal but directions are same. In this case $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ do not cancel at this spot. The positive value corresponds to the location shown in the figure and is the zero filed location, hence, $d=+1.0 \mathrm{~m}$.

Example 9.3 A proton experiences an electrostatic force equal to its weight at a particular point in an electric field. What is the field intensity at that point?
Mass of proton $=1.67 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg}$ and charge, $e=1.6 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{C}$
Using

$$
E=\frac{F}{q}=\frac{m g}{e}
$$

Substituting the values,

$$
E=\frac{1.67 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}}{1.6 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{C}}=1.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{NC}^{-1}
$$

## Electric Field Lines

A visual representation of the electric field can be obtained in terms of electric field lines, an idea proposed by Michael Faraday. Electric field lines can be considered as a visual map used to represent the direction and strength of an electric field around a charged object. As electric field lines provide information about the electric force exerted on a

charged object, these lines are commonly called "electric lines of force".
To introduce electric field lines, we place positive test charges $+q_{0}$ each of magnitude $q_{0}$ at different places but at equal distances from a positive charge $+q$ as shown in the Fig. 9.6. Each test charge will experience a repulsive force, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 9.6(a). Therefore, the electric field created by the charge $+q$ is directed radially outward. Figure 9.6(b) shows corresponding field lines which show the field
Fig 9.6
(a) A positive test charge $+q_{0}$ placed anywhere in the vicinity of a positive point charge $+q$ experiences a repulsive force directed radially outward.
(b) The electric field lines are directed radially outward from the positive point charge $+q$.
direction. Figure 9.7 shows the electric field lines in the vicinity of a negative charge $-q$. In this case the lines are directed radially "inward", because the force on a positive test charge is now of attraction, indicating the electric field points inward.
Figures 9.6 and 9.7 represent two dimensional pictures of the field lines. However, electric field lines emerge from the charges in three dimensions, and an infinite number of lines could be drawn.
The electric field lines "map" also provides information about the strength of the electric field. As we notice in Figs. 9.6 and 9.7 that field lines are closer to each other near the charges where the field is strong while they continuously spread out indicating a continuous decrease in the field strength.

The number of lines per unit area passing perpendicularly through it is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field.
The electric field lines are curved in case of two identical separated charges. Figure 9.8 shows the pattern of lines associated with two identical positive point charges of
Fig 9.7: The electric field lines are directed radially inward towards a negative point charge $-q$.
Fig.9.8: The electric field lines for two identical opposite point charges.

equal magnitude. It reveals that the lines in the region between two like charges seem to repel each other. The behaviour of two identical negatively charges will be exactly the same. The middle region shows the presence of a zero field spot or neutral zone.
Figure 9.9 shows the electric field pattern of two opposite charges of equal magnitudes. The field lines start from positive charge and end on a negative charge. The electric field at points such as $1,2,3$ is the resultant of fields created by the two charges at these points. The directions of the resultant intensities is given by the tangents drawn to the field lines at these points.
In the regions where the field lines are parallel and equally spaced, the same number of lines pass per unit area and therefore, field is uniform on all points. Figure 9.10 shows the field lines between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor. The field is uniform in the middle region where field lines are equally spaced.
We are now in a position to summarize the properties of electric field lines.

1. Electric field lines originate from positive charges and end on negative charges.
2. The tangent to a field line at any point gives the direction of the electric field at that point.
3. The lines are closer where the field is strong and the lines are farther apart where the field is weak.
4. No two lines cross each other. This is because E hes only one direction at any given point. If the lines cross E could have more than one direction.
