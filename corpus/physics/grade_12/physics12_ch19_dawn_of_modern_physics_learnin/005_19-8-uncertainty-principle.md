### 19.8 UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE

Position and momentum of a particle cannot both be measured simultaneously with perfect accuracy. There is always a fundamental uncertainty associated with any measurement. This uncertainty is not associated with the measuring instrument. It is a consequence of the wave particle duality of matter and radiation. This was first proposed by Werner Heisenberg in 1927 and hence is known as Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This fundamental uncertainty is completely negligible for measurements of position and momentum of macroscopic objects but is a predominant fact of life in the atomic domain. For example, a stream of light photons scattering from a flying tennis ball

hardly affects its path, but one photon striking an electron drastically alters the electron's motion. Since light has also wave properties, we would expect to be able to determine the position of the electron only to within one wavelength of the light being used. Hence, in order to observe the position of an electron with less uncertainty and also for minimizing diffraction effect, we must use light of short wavelength. But it will alter the motion drastically making momentum measurement less precise. If light of wavelength $\lambda$ is used to locate a micro particle moving along $x$-axis, the uncertainty in its position measurement is

$$
\Delta x \approx \lambda
$$

At most, the photon of light can transfer all its momentum $\left(\frac{\mathrm{h}}{\lambda}\right)$ to the micro particle whose own momentum will then be uncertain by an amount

$$
\Delta p \approx \frac{\mathrm{~h}}{\lambda}
$$

Multiplying these two uncertainties gives

$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \approx \lambda\left(\frac{\mathrm{~h}}{\lambda}\right) \approx \mathrm{h}
$$

The equation 19.19 is the mathematical form of uncertainty principle. It states that the product of the uncertainty $\Delta x$ in the position of a particle at some instant and the uncertainty $\Delta p$ in the $x$-component of its momentum at the same instant approximately equals Planck's constant $h$.
There is another form of uncertainty principle which relates the energy of a particle and the time at which it had the energy. If the $\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in our knowledge of the energy of our particle and if the time interval during which
the particle had the energy $E \pm \frac{\Delta E}{2}$ is $t_{0} \pm \frac{\Delta t}{2}$, then

$$
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx h
$$

Thus more accurately we determined the energy of a particle, the more uncertain we will be of the time during which it has that energy.
According to Heisenberg's more careful calculations, he found that at the very best

For Your Information
You can never accurately describe all aspects of a subatomic particle at once.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \hbar \\
& \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \hbar
\end{aligned}
$$

where

$$
\hbar=\frac{\hbar}{2 \pi}=1.05 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}
$$

Wener Karl Heisenberg received Nobel Prize for physics in 1932 for the development of quantum mechanics.

Example 19.10: The life time of an electron in an excited state is about $10^{-8} \mathrm{~s}$. What is its uncertainty in energy during this time?

# Solution:

Using uncertainty principle

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar \\
& \Delta E=\frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}=\frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}}{10^{-8} \mathrm{~s}} \\
& \Delta E=1.05 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 19.11: An electron is to be confined to a box of the size of the nucleus $\left(1.0 \times 10^{-14} \mathrm{~m}\right)$. What would the speed of the electron be if it were so confined?

## Solution:

Maximum uncertainty in the location of electron equals the size of the box itself that is $\Delta x=1.0 \times 10^{-14} \mathrm{~m}$. The minimum uncertainty in the velocity of electron is found from Heisenberg uncertainty principle

$$
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta x}
$$

or

$$
m \Delta V \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta x}
$$

$\Delta V \approx \frac{\hbar}{\mathrm{~m} \Delta \mathrm{x}}=\frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}}{9.1 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg} \times 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \mathrm{~m}}=1.15 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$
For confinement In the box, the speed should be greater than the speed of light. Because this is not possible, we must conclude that an electron can never be found inside the nucleus.

# SUMMARY

- An inertial frame of reference is defined as a coordinate system in which the law of inertia is valid. A frame of reference that is not accelerating is an inertial frame of reference.
- The special theory of relatively treats problems involving inertial or non-accelerating frames of reference. It is based upon two postulates.
(i) The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.
(ii) The speed of light in free space has the same value for all observers, regardless of their state of motion.
$E=m c$ is an important result of special theory of relativity
- A black body is a solid block having a hollow cavity within it. It has small hole and the radiation can enter or escape only through this hole.
- Stephen Boltzmann law states that total energy radiated over all wave length at a particular temperature is directly proportional to the fourth power of that Kelvin temperature.
- The emission of electrons from a metal surface when exposed to ultraviolet light is called photoelectric effect. The emitted electrons are known as photoelectrons.
- When X-rays are scattered by loosely bound electrons from a graphite target, it is known as Compton effect.
- The change of very high energy photon into an electron, positron pair is called pair production.
- When a positron comes close to an electron, they annihilate and produce two photons in the $\gamma$-rays range. It is called annihilation of matter.
- Position and momentum of a particle cannot both be measured simultaneously with perfect accuracy. There is always a fundamental uncertainty associated with any measurement. It is a consequence of the wave particle duality of matter and radiation. It is known as Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
