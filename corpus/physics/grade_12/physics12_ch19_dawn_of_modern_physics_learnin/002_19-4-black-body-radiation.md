### 19.4 BLACK BODY RADIATION

When a body is heated, it emits radiation. The nature of radiation depends upon the temperature. At low temperature, a body emits radiation which is principally of long wavelengths in the invisible infrared region. At high temperature, the proportion of shorter wavelength radiation increases. Furthermore, the amount of emitted radiation is different for different wavelengths. It is of interest to see how the energy is distributed among different wavelengths at various temperatures. For example, when platinum wire is heated, it appears dull red at about $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, changes to cherry red at $900^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, becomes orange red at $1100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, yellow at $1300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and finally white at about $1600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This shows that as the temperature is increased, the radiation becomes richer in shorter wavelengths.
In order to understand the distribution of radiation emitted from a hot body, we consider a non-reflecting object such as a solid
(a) Absorption of radiation

Fig. 19.1

that has a hollow cavity within it. It has a small hole and the radiation can enter or escape only through this hole. The inside is blackened with soot to make it as good an absorber and as bad a reflector as possible. The small hole appears black because the radiation that enters is reflected from the inside walls many times and is partly absorbed at each reflection until none remains. Such a body is termed as black body and has the property to absorb all the radiation entering it. A black body is both an ideal absorber (Fig. 19.1 a) and an ideal radiator (Fig. 19.1 b).

# Intensity Distribution Diagram

Lummer and Pringsheim measured the intensity of emitted energy with wavelength radiated from a black body at different temperatures by the apparatus shown in Fig.19.2. The amount of radiation emitted with different wavelengths is shown in the form of energy distribution curves for each temperature in the Fig.19.3.
These curves reveal the following interesting facts.

1. At a given temperature, the energy is not uniformly distributed in the radiation spectrum of the body.
2. At a given temperature $T$, the emitted energy has maximum value for a certain wavelength $\lambda_{\text {max }}$ and the product $\lambda_{\text {max }} \times$ T remains constant .

$$
\lambda_{\max } \times T=\text { Constant }
$$

The value of the constant known as Wien's constant is about $2.9 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~K}$. This equation means that as $T$

increases, $\lambda_{\text {max }}$ shifts to shorter wavelength.
3. For all wavelengths, an increase in temperature causes an increase in energy emission. The radiation intensity increases with increase in wavelengths and at a particular wavelength $\lambda_{\text {max }}$, it has a maximum value. With further increase in wavelength, the intensity decreases.
4 The area under each curve represents the total energy $(E)$ radiated per second per square metre over all wavelengths at a particular temperature. It is found that area is directly proportional to the fourth power of kelvin temperature $T$. Thus

$$
E \propto T^{4} \quad \text { or } \quad E=\sigma_{T}^{4}
$$

where $\sigma$ is called Stefen's constant. Its value is $5.67 \times 10^{-6}$ $\mathrm{Wm}^{-2} \mathrm{~K}^{+}$and the above relation is known as StefenBoltzmann law.

# Planck's Assumption

Electromagnetic wave theory of radiation cannot explain the energy distribution along the intensity-wavelengths curves. The successful attempts to explain the shape of energy distribution curves gave rise to a new and non-classical view of electromagnetic radiation. In 1900, Max Planck founded a mathematical model resulting in an equation that describes the shape of observed curves exactly. He suggested that energy is radiated or absorbed in discrete packets, called quanta rather than as a continuous wave. Each quantum is associated with radiation of a single frequency. The energy $E$ of each quantum is proportional to its frequency $f$, and

$$
E=\mathrm{hf}
$$

where $h$ is Planck's constant. Its value is $6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}$. This fundamental constant is as important in physics as the constant $c$, the speed of light in vacuum.
Max Planck received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1918 for his discovery of energy quanta.

## The Photon

Planck suggested that as matter is not continuous but consists of a large number of tiny particles, so is the radiation energy from a source. He assumed that granular nature of

radiation from hot bodies was due to some property of the atoms producing it. Einstein extended his idea and postulated that packets or tiny bundles of energy are integral part of all electromagnetic radiation and that they could not be subdivided. These indivisible tiny bundles of energy he called photons. The beam of light with wavelength $\lambda$ consists of stream of photons travelling at speed $c$ and carries energy hf. From the theory of relativity momentum $p$ of the photon is related to energy as

$$
E=p c
$$

Thus $p c=\mathrm{hf} \quad$ or $\quad p=\frac{\mathrm{hf}}{c}=\frac{\mathrm{h}}{\lambda}$
The table 19.1 relates the quanta emitted in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum with energy. At the high end, $\gamma$ - radiation with energy $\sim 1 \mathrm{MeV}$ is easily detected as quanta by a radiation detector and counter. At the other end, the energy of photon of radio waves is only about $10^{-10} \mathrm{eV}$. So millions of photons are needed to detect a signal and hence wave properties of radio waves predominate. The quanta are

Table: 19.1 Electromagnetic spectrum
so close together in energy value that radio waves are detected as continuous radiation.

The emission or absorption of energy in steps may be extended to include any system such as a mass oscillating on a spring. However, the energy steps are far too small to be detected and so any granular nature is invisible. Quantum effects are only important when observing atomic sized objects, where $h$ is a significant factor in any detectable energy change.
Example 19.4: Assuming you radiate as does a blackbody at your body temperature about $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, at what wavelength do you emit the most energy?

# Solution:

$$
\begin{gathered}
T=37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=310 \mathrm{~K} \\
\text { Wien's constant }=2.9 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{mK} \\
\lambda_{\max }=? \\
\text { Using } \quad \lambda_{\max } \times T=\text { Constant } \\
\lambda_{\max }=\frac{2.9 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{mK}}{310 \mathrm{~K}}=9.35 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}=9.35 \mu \mathrm{~m}
\end{gathered}
$$

The radiation lies in the invisible infrared region and is independent of skin colour.
Example 19.5: What is the energy of a photon in a beam of infrared radiation of wavelength 1240 nm ?

## Solution:

$$
\lambda=1240 \mathrm{~nm} \quad E=?
$$

Using $\quad E=\mathrm{h} f=\frac{\mathrm{hc}}{\lambda}$

$$
E=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js} \times 3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{1240 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}}=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}
$$

or $\quad E=1.0 \mathrm{eV}$
