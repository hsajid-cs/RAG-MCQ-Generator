### 19.6 ANNIHILATION OF MATTER

It is converse of pair production when a positron comes close to an electron they annihilate or destroy each other. The matter of two particles changes into electromagnetic energy producing two photons in the $\gamma$-rays range.

$$
e^{-}+e^{+} \longrightarrow \gamma+\gamma
$$

The two photons are produced travelling in opposite directions (Fig. 19.11) so that momentum is conserved. Each

photon has energy 0.51 MeV equivalent to rest mass energy of a particle.

The existence of positron was predicted by Dirac in 1928 and it was discovered in the cosmic radiation in 1932 by Carl Anderson. It gradually became clear that every particle has a corresponding antiparticle with the same mass and charge (if it is a charged particle) but of opposite sign. Particles and antiparticles also differ in the signs of other quantum numbers that we have not yet discussed. A particle and its antiparticle cannot exist together at one place. Whenever they meet, they annihilate each other. That is, the particles disappear, their combined rest energies appear in other forms. Proton and antiproton annihilation has also been observed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.

# 19.7 WAVE NATURE OF PARTICLES

It has been observed that light displays a dual nature, it acts as a wave and it acts as a particle. Assuming symmetry in nature, the French physicist, Louis de Broglie proposed in 1924 that particles should also possess wavelike properties. As momentum $p$ of photon is given by equation 19.11.

$$
p=\frac{\mathrm{h}}{\lambda}
$$

de Broglie suggested that momentum of a material particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ should be given by the same expression. Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
& p=\frac{\mathrm{h}}{\lambda}=m v \\
& \lambda=\frac{\mathrm{h}}{p}=\frac{\mathrm{h}}{m v}
\end{aligned}
$$

## where $\lambda$ is the wavelength associated with particle waves. Hence an electron can be considered to be a particle and it can also be considered to be a wave. The equation 19.17 is called de Broglie relation.
An object of large mass and ordinary speed has such a small wavelength that its wave effects such as interference and diffraction are negligible. For example, a rifle bullet of mass 20 g and flying with speed $330 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ will have a wavelength $\lambda$ given by

$$
\lambda=\frac{\mathrm{h}}{m v}=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}}{2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~kg} \times 330 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}=1 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~m}
$$

Light is, in short, the most refined form of matter (Louis de Broglie 1892-1987).

This wavelength is so small that it is not measurable or detectable by any of its effects.
On the other hand for an electron moving with a speed of $1 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$,

$$
\lambda=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}}{9.1 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg} \times 1 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}=7 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}
$$

This wavelength is in the X-rays range. Thus, diffraction effects for electrons are measurable whereas diffraction or interference effects for bullets are not.

# Davisson and Germer Experiment

A convincing evidence of the wave nature of electrons was provided by Clinton J. Davisson and Laster H. Germer. They showed that electrons are diffracted from metal crystals in exactly the same manner as X-rays or any other wave. The apparatus used by them is shown in Fig. 19.12, in which electrons from heated filament are accelerated by an adjustable applied voltage $V$. The electron beam of energy Ve is made incident on a nickel crystal. The beam diffracted from crystal surface enters a detector and is recorded as a current $I$. The gain in $K . E$. of the electron as it is accelerated by a potential $V$ in the electron gun is
given by

$$
\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=V e
$$

or

$$
m v^{2}=2 \mathrm{Ve} ; \quad m^{2} v^{2}=2 \mathrm{mVe}
$$

or

$$
m v=\sqrt{2 m V e}
$$

From de Broglie equation

$$
\lambda=\frac{h}{m v}
$$

Thus

$$
\lambda=\frac{h}{\sqrt{2 m V e}}
$$

In one of the experiments, the accelerating voltage $V$ was 54 volts, hence

$$
\begin{gathered}
\lambda=\frac{h}{\sqrt{2 m V e}}=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}}{\sqrt{2 \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg} \times 54 \mathrm{JC}^{-1} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}}} \\
\lambda=1.66 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}
\end{gathered}
$$

This beam of electrons diffracted from crystal surface was obtained for a glancing angle of $65^{\circ}$. According to Bragg's
Fig. 19.12 Experimental arrangement of Davisson and Germer for electron diffraction.

equation

$$
2 d \sin \theta=m \lambda
$$

For 1st order diffraction $m=1$
For nickel

$$
d=0.91 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}
$$

Thus

$$
2 \times 0.91 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m} \times \sin 65^{\circ}=\lambda
$$

which gives $\lambda=1.65 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}$
Thus, experimentally observed wavelength is in excellent agreement with theoretically predicted wavelength.

(a) If electrons behaved as discrete particles with no wave properties they would pass through one or the other of the two slits and strike the screen causing it to glow and produce exact images of the slits (b) In reality the screen reveals a pattern of bright and dark fringes similar to light is used and interference occurs between the light waves coming from each slit.
diffraction patterns have also been observed with protons, neutrons, hydrogen atoms and helium atoms thereby giving substantial evidence for the wave nature of particles.

For his work on the dual nature of particles, Prince Louis Victor de Broglie received the 1929 Nobel Prize in physics. Clinton Joseph Davisson and George Paget Thomson shared the Nobel Prize in 1937 for their experimental confirmation of the wave nature of particles.

## Wave Particle Duality

Interference and diffraction of light confirm its wave nature, while photoelectric effect proves the particle nature of light. Similarly, the experiments of Davisson and Germer and G. P. Thomson reveal wave like nature of electrons and in the experiment of J. J. Thomson to find e/m we had to assume particle like nature of the electron. In the same way we are forced to assume both wavelike and particle like properties for all matter: electrons, protons, neutrons, molecules etc. and also light, X-rays, $\gamma$-rays etc. have to be included in this. In other words, matter and radiation have a dual 'waveparticle' nature and this new concept is known as wave particle duality. Niels Bohr pointed out in stating his principle of complementarity that both wave and particle aspects are required for the complete description of both radiation and matter. Both aspects are always present and either may be revealed by an experiment. However, both aspects cannot be revealed simultaneously in a single experiment, which aspect is revealed is determined by the nature of the experiment being done. If you put a diffraction grating in the path of a light beam, you reveal it as a wave. If you allow the light beam to hit a metal surface, you need to regard the beam as a stream of particles to explain your observations. There is no simple experiment that you can carry out with the

beam that will require you to interpret it as a wave and as a particle at the same time. Light behaves as a stream of photons when it interacts with matter and behaves as a wave in traveling from a source to the place where it is detected. In effect, all micro-particles (electrons, protons, photons, atoms etc.) propagate as if they were waves and exchange energies as if they were particles - that is the wave particle duality.
Example 19.8: A particle of mass 5.0 mg moves with speed of $8.0 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$. Calculate its de Broglie wavelength.

# Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
m & =5.0 \mathrm{mg}=5.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~kg} \\
v & =8.0 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
\mathrm{~h} & =6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using $\quad \lambda=\frac{\mathrm{h}}{m c}=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}}{5.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~kg} \times 8.0 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}=1.66 \times 10^{-29} \mathrm{~m}$
Example 19.9: An electron is accelerated through a Potential Difference of 50 V . Calculate its de Broglie wavelength.

## Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
m & =9.1 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg}, \quad V_{a}=50 \mathrm{~V} \\
\lambda & =?, \quad e=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C} \\
\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} & =V_{a} e \\
p & =m v=\sqrt{2 m V_{a} e}
\end{aligned}
$$

then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda= & \frac{\mathrm{h}}{p}=\frac{\mathrm{h}}{\sqrt{2 m V_{a} e}} \\
& =\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}}{\sqrt{2 \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg} \times 50 \mathrm{JC}^{-1} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}}} \\
\lambda & =1.74 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Uses of Wave Nature of Particles

The fact that energetic particles have extremely short de Broglie wavelengths has been put to practical use in many ultra-modern devices of immense importance such as electron microscope.

## In the subatomic world few things can be predicted with $100 \%$ precision.

## Electron Microscope

Electron microscope makes practical use of the wave nature of electrons which is thousands of time shorter than visible light which enables the electron microscope to distinguish details not visible with optical microscope. In an electron microscope, electric and magnetic fields rather than optical lenses are used to focus electrons by means of electromagnetic forces that are exerted on moving charges. The resulting deflections of the electrons beams are similar to the refraction effects produced by glass lenses used to focus light in optical microscope. The electrons are accelerated to high energies by applying voltage from 30 kV to several megavolts. Such high voltages give extremely short wavelength and also give the electron sufficient energy to penetrate specimen of reasonable thickness. A resolution of 0.5 to 1 nm is possible with a 50 kV microscope as compared to best optical resolution of $0.2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. A schematic diagram of the electron microscope is shown in the Figure 19.13. The magnetic conducting lens concentrates the beam from an electron gun on to the specimen. Electrons are scattered out of the beam from the thicker parts of the specimen. The transmitted beam therefore has spatial differences in density that correspond to the features of the specimen. The objective and intermediate lenses produce a real intermediate image and projection lens forms the final image which can be viewed on a fluorescent screen or photographed on special film known as electron micrograph. A three dimensional image of remarkable quality can be achieved by modern versions called scanning electron microscopes.
