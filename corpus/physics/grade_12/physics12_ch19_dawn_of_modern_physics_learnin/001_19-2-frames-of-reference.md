### 19.2 FRAMES OF REFERENCE

We have discussed the most commonly used Cartesian coordinate system. In effect, a frame of reference is any coordinate system relative to which measurements are taken. The position of a table in a room can be located relative to the walls of the room. The room is then the frame of reference. For measurements taken in the college laboratory, the laboratory is the reference frame. If the same experiment is performed in a moving train, the train becomes a frame of reference. The position of a spaceship can be described relative to the positions of the distant stars. A coordinate system based on these stars is then the frame of reference.
An inertial frame of reference is defined as a coordinate system in which the law of inertia is valid. That is, a body at

rest remains at rest unless an unbalanced force produces acceleration in it. Other laws of nature also apply in such a system. If we place a body upon Earth it remains at rest unless an unbalanced force is applied upon it. This observation shows that Earth may be considered as an inertial frame of reference. A body placed in a car moving with a uniform velocity with respect to Earth also remains at rest, so that car is also an inertial frame of reference. Thus any frame of reference which is moving with uniform velocity relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame.
When the moving car is suddenly stopped, the body placed in it, no longer remains at rest. So is the case when the car is suddenly accelerated. In such a situation, the car is not an inertial frame of reference. Thus an accelerated frame is a non-inertial frame of reference. Earth is rotating and revolving and hence strictly speaking, the Earth is not an inertial frame. But it can often be treated as an inertial frame without serious error because of very small acceleration.

# 19.3 SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY

The theory of relativity is concerned with the way in which observers who are in a state of relative motion describe physical phenomena. The special theory of relativity treats problems involving inertial or non-accelerating frames of reference. There is another theory called general theory of relativity which treats problems involving frames of reference accelerating with respect to one another. The special theory of relativity is based upon two postulates, which can be stated as follows:

1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.
2. The speed of light in free space has the same value for all observers, regardless of their state of motion.
The first postulate is the generalization of the fact that all physical laws are the same in frames of reference moving with uniform velocity with respect to one another. If the laws of physics were different for different observers in relative motion, the observer could determine from this difference that which of them were stationary in a space and which were moving. But such a distinction does not exist, so this postulate implies that there is no way to detect absolute uniform motion. The second postulate states an experimental fact that speed of light in free space is the universal constant ' $c$ ' ( $c=3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ ). These simple postulates have far-reaching consequences. These

include such phenomena as the slowing down of clocks and contraction of lengths in moving reference frames as measured by a stationary observer. Some interesting results of the special theory of relativity can be summarized as follows without going into their mathematical derivations.

# Time Dilation

According to special theory of relativity, time is not absolute quantity. It depends upon the motion of the frame of reference.

Suppose an observer is stationary in an inertial frame. He measures the time interval between two events in this frame. Let it be $t_{v}$. This is known as proper time. If the observer is moving with respect to frame of events with velocity $v$ or if the frame of events is moving with respect to observer with a uniform velocity $v$, the time measured by the observer would not be $t_{v}$, but it would be $t$ given by

$$
t=\frac{t_{v}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
$$

As the quantity $\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}$ is always less than one, so $t$ is greater than $t_{v}$ i.e., time has dilated or stretched due to relative motion of the observer and the frame of reference of events. This astonishing result applies to all timing processes - physical, chemical and biological. Even aging process of the human body is slowed by motion at very high speeds.

## Length Contraction

The distance from Earth to a star measured by an observer in a moving spaceship would seem smaller than the distance measured by an observer on Earth. That is, if you are in motion relative to two points that are a fixed distance apart, the distance between the two points appears shorter than if you were at rest relative to them. This effect is known as length contraction. The length contraction happens only along the direction of motion. No such contraction would be observed perpendicular to the direction of motion. The length of an object or distance between two points measured by an observer who is relatively at rest is called proper length ' $l_{v}$ '. If an object and an observer are in relative motion with speed $v$, then the contracted length ' $l$ ' is given by

$$
\ell=\ell_{0} \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}
$$

# Mass Variation

According to special theory of relativity, mass of an object is a varying quantity and depends upon the speed of the object. An object whose mass when measured at rest is $m_{n}$ will have an increased mass $m$ when observed to be moving at speed $v$. They are related by

$$
m=\frac{m_{n}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
$$

The increase in mass indicates the increase in inertia the object has at high speeds. As $v$ approaches $c$, it requires a larger and larger force to change the speed of the object.
As $\quad v \rightarrow c, \frac{v}{c} \rightarrow 1 \quad$ therefore $\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \rightarrow 0$
Thus

$$
m \rightarrow \infty
$$

An infinite mass would require an infinite force to accelerate it. Because infinite forces are not available, hence, an object cannot be accelerated to the speed of light' $c^{\prime}$ in free space.
In our everyday life, we deal with extremely small speeds, compared to the speed of light. Even the Earth's orbital speed is only $30 \mathrm{kms}^{-1}$. On the other hand, the speed of light in free space is $300,000 \mathrm{kms}^{-1}$. This is the reason why Newton's laws are valid in everyday situations. However, when experimenting with atomic particles moving with velocities approaching speed of light, the relativistic effects are very prominent, and experimental results cannot be explained without taking Einstein's equations into account.

## Energy $\cdot$ Mass Relation

According to special theory of relativity, mass and energy are different entities but are interconvertible. The total energy $E$ and mass $m$ of an object are related by the expression

$$
E=m c^{2}
$$

where $m$ depends on the speed of the object. At rest, the energy equivalent of an object's mass $m_{n}$ is called rest mass energy $E_{n}$.

$$
E_{n}=m_{n} c^{2}
$$

As $m c^{2}$ is greater than $m_{n} c^{2}$, the difference of energy $\left(m c^{2}-m_{n} c^{2}\right)$ is due to motion, as such it represents the kinetic energy of the mass. Hence

$$
K . E_{1}=\left(m-m_{n}\right) c^{2}
$$

From equation 19.4 above, the change in mass $m$ due to change in energy $\Delta E$ is given by

$$
\Delta m=\frac{\Delta E}{c^{2}}
$$

Because $c^{2}$ is a very large quantity, this implies that small changes in mass require very large changes in energy. In our everyday world, energy changes are too small to provide measurable mass changes. However, energy and mass changes in nuclear reactions are found to be exactly in accordance with the above mentioned equations.

# NAVSTAR Navigation System

The results of special theory of relativity are put to practical use even in everyday life by a modern system of navigation satellites called NAVSTAR. The location and speed anywhere on Earth can now be determined to an accuracy of about $2 \mathrm{cms}^{-1}$. However, if relativity effects are not taken into account, speed could not be determined any closer than about $20 \mathrm{cms}^{-1}$. Using these results the location of an aircraft after an hour's flight can be predicted to about 50 m as compared to about 760 m determined by without using relativistic effects.

Example 19.1: The period of a pendulum is measured to be 3.0 s in the inertial reference frame of the pendulum. What is its period measured by an observer moving at a speed of 0.95 c with respect to the pendulum?

## Solution:

$$
t_{n}=3.0 \mathrm{~s}, \quad v=0.95 c, t=\text { ? }
$$

Using

$$
t=\frac{t_{0}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}
$$

$t=\frac{3.0 \mathrm{~s}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.95 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}}=\frac{3.0 \mathrm{~s}}{\sqrt{1-(0.95)^{2}}}=9.6 \mathrm{~s}$

Example 19.2: A bar 1.0 m in length and located along $x$-axis moves with a speed of 0.75 c with respect to a stationary observer. What is the length of the bar as measured by the stationary observer?

# Solution:

$$
\ell_{0}=1.0 \mathrm{~m}, \quad v=0.75 \mathrm{c}, \quad \ell=\text { ? }
$$

Using

$$
\ell=\ell_{0} \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}
$$

$$
\ell=1.0 \mathrm{~m} \times \sqrt{1-\frac{(0.75 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}=1.0 \mathrm{~m} \times \sqrt{1-(0.75)^{2}}=0.66 \mathrm{~m}
$$

Example 19.3: Find the mass $m$ of a moving object with speed 0.8 c .

## Solution:

Using

$$
m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
$$

or

$$
m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.8 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}}=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-(0.8)^{2}}}=1.67 m_{0}
$$

or

$$
m=1.67 m_{0}
$$
