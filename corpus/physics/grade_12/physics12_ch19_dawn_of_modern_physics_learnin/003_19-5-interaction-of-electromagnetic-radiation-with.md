## Photoelectric Effect ${ }^{2} \cdot 7$

The emission of electrons from a metal surface when exposed to light of suitable frequency is called the photoelectric effect. The emitted electrons are known as photoelectrons.

The photoelectric effect is demonstrated by the apparatus shown in Fig. 19.4. An evacuated glass tube $X$ contains two electrodes. The electrode A connected to the positive terminal of the battery is known as anode. The electrode $C$ connected to negative terminal is known as cathode. When monochromatic light is allowed to shine on cathode, it begins to emit electrons. These photoelectrons are attracted by the positive anode and the resulting current is measured by an ammeter. The current stops when light is cut off, which proves, that the current flows because of incident light. This current is, hence, called photoelectric current. The maximum energy of the photoelectrons can be determined by reversing the connection of the battery in the circuit i.e., now the anode A is negative and cathode C is at positive potential. In this condition the photoelectrons are repelled by the anode and the photoelectric current decreases. If this potential is made more and more negative, at a certain value, called stopping potential $V_{0}$, the current becomes zero. Even the electrons of maximum energy are not able to reach collector plate. The maximum energy of photoelectrons is thus

$$
\frac{1}{2} m v_{\max }^{2}=V_{0} e
$$

where $m$ is mass, $v$ is velocity and $e$ is the charge on electron. If the experiment is repeated with light beam of higher intensity, the amount of current increases but the current stops for the same value of $V_{0}$. The Fig. 19.5 shows two curves of photoelectric current as a function of potential $V$ where $I_{2}>I_{1}$. If, however, the intensity is kept constant and experiment is performed with different frequencies of incident light, we obtain the curves shown in Fig.19.6. The current is same but stopping potential is different for each frequency of incident light, which indicates the proportionality of maximum kinetic energy with frequency of light $f$.

The important results of the experiments are

1. The electrons are emitted with different energies. The maximum energy of photoelectrons depends on the particular metal surface and the frequency of incident light.
2. There is a minimum frequency below which no electrons are emitted, however intense the light may be. This threshold frequency $f_{0}$ varies from metal to metal.
3. Electrons are emitted instantaneously, the intensity of light determines only their number.
These results could not be explained on the basis of electromagnetic wave theory of light. According to this theory, increasing the intensity of incident light should increase the K.E. of emitted electrons which contradicts the experimental result. The classical theory cannot also explain the threshold frequency of light.

## Explanation on the Basis of Quantum Theory

Einstein extended the idea of quantization of energy proposed by Max Planck that light is emitted or absorbed in quanta, known as photons. The energy of each photon of frequency $f$ as given by quantum theory is

$$
E=h f
$$

A photon could be absorbed by a single electron in the metal surface. The electron needs a certain minimum energy called the work function ' $\Phi$ ' to escape from the metal surface. If the energy of incident photon is sufficient, the electron is ejected instantaneously from the metal surface. A part of the photon energy (work function) is used by the electron to break away from the metal and the rest appears as the kinetic energy of the electron. That is,
Incident photon energy - Work function = Max. K.E. of photoelectron
or

$$
h f-\Phi=\frac{1}{2} m v_{\max }^{2}
$$

This is known as Einstein's photoelectric equation.
When $K . E_{\text {max }}$ of the photoelectron is zero, the frequency $f$ is equal to threshold frequency $f_{0}$, hence the Eq. 19.12 becomes

$$
h f_{0}-\Phi=0 \quad \text { or } \quad \Phi=h f_{0}
$$

Hence, we can also write Einstein's photoelectric equation as

It is to be noted that all the emitted electrons do not possess the maximum kinetic energy, some electrons come straight out of the metal surface and some lose energy in atomic collisions before coming out. The equation 19.14 holds good only for those electrons which come out with full surplus energy.

Albert Einstein was awarded Nobel Prize in physics in 1921 for his explanation of photoelectric effect.

Note that the phenomenon of photoelectric effect cannot be explained if we assume that light consists of waves and energy is uniformly distributed over its wavefront. It can only be explained by assuming light consists of corpuscles of energy known as photon. Thus it shows the corpuscular nature of light.

## Photocell

A photocell is based on photoelectric effect. A simple photocell is shown in Fig. 19.7. It consists of an evacuated glass bulb with a thin anode rod and a cathode of an appropriate metal surface. The material of the cathode is selected to suit to the frequency range of incident radiation over which the cell is operated. For example sodium or potassium cathode emits electrons for visible light, cesium coated oxidized silver emits electrons for infrared light and some other metals respond to ultraviolet radiation. When photo-emissive surface is exposed to appropriate light (Fig.19.8 a), electrons are emitted and a current flows in the external circuit which increases with the increase in light intensity. The current stops when the light beam is interrupted. The cell has wide range of applications. Some of these are to operate:

1. Security systems
2. Counting systems
3. Automatic door systems
4. Automatic street lighting
5. Exposure meter for photography
6. Sound track of movies (Fig. 19.8 b)

Example 19.6: A sodium surface is illuminated with light of wavelength 300 nm . The work function of sodium metal

is 2.46 eV .
(a) Find the maximum $K . E$. of the ejected electron.
(b) Determine the cut off wavelength for sodium.

# Solution:

$$
\lambda=300 \mathrm{~nm}, \quad \Phi=2.46 \mathrm{eV}
$$

(a) Energy of incident photon $E=\mathrm{h} f=\frac{\mathrm{hc}}{\lambda}$
or $E=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js} \times 3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{300 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}}=6.63 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}$

$$
E=4.14 \mathrm{eV}
$$

Now $K . E_{\max }=\mathrm{h} f-\Phi=4.14 \mathrm{eV}-2.46 \mathrm{eV}=1.68 \mathrm{eV}$
(b) $\Phi=2.46 \mathrm{eV}=3.94 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}$

Using

$$
\Phi=\mathrm{h} f_{0}=\frac{\mathrm{hc}}{\lambda_{0}}
$$

or $\lambda_{0}=\frac{h c}{\Phi}=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js} \times 3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{3.94 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}}=5.05 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~m}$

$$
\lambda_{0}=505 \mathrm{~nm}
$$

The cut off wavelength is in the green region of the visible spectrum

## Compton Effect

Arthur Holly Compton at Washington University in 1923 studied the scattering of X-rays by loosely bound electrons from a graphite target (Fig.19.9 a). He measured the wavelength of X-rays scattered at an angel $\theta$ with the original direction. He found that wavelength $\lambda_{0}$ of the scattered $X$-rays is larger than the wavelength $\lambda_{c}$ of the incident $X$-rays. This is known as Compton effect. The increase in wavelength of scattered $X$-rays could not be explained on the basis of classical wave theory. Compton suggested that X-rays consist of photons and in the process of scattering the photons suffer collision with electrons like billiard balls (Fig. 19.9 b \& c). In this collision, a part of incident photon energy and momentum is transferred to an electron. Applying energy and momentum conservation laws to the process, he derived an expression for the change in wavelength $\Delta \lambda$ known as Compton shift for scattering angle $\theta$ as
(a)

Fig. 19.9 (a) Compton's scattering experiment

(b)
(c)
(b) A photon collides with an electron and (c) Both are scattered

$$
\Delta \lambda=\frac{h}{m_{0} c}(1-\cos \theta)
$$

where $m_{0}$ is the rest mass of the electron. The factor $\frac{h}{m_{0} c}$ has dimensions of length and is called Compton wavelength and has the numerical value

$$
\frac{h}{m_{0} c}=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}}{9.1 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg} \times 3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}=2.43 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~m}
$$

If the scattered X-ray photons are observed at $\theta=90^{\circ}$, the Compton shift $\Delta \lambda$ equals the Compton wavelength. The Eq.19.15 was found to be in complete agreement with Compton's experimental result, which again is a striking confirmation of particle like interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter.

Arthur Holly Compton was awarded Nobel Prize in physics in 1927 for his discovery of the effect named after him.

Example 19.7: A 50 keV photon is Compton scattered by a quasi-free electron. If the scattered photon comes off at $45^{\circ}$, what is its wavelength?

# Solution:

$$
E=50 \mathrm{keV}=50 \times 10^{3} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}
$$

Using

$$
E=\mathrm{hf}=\frac{\mathrm{hc}}{\lambda} \quad \text { or } \quad \lambda=\frac{\mathrm{hc}}{E}
$$

$$
\lambda=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js} \times 3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{50 \times 10^{3} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}}=0.0248 \mathrm{~nm}
$$

Now

$$
\begin{gathered}
\lambda^{\prime}-\lambda=\frac{h}{m c}\left(1-\cos 45^{\circ}\right) \\
\lambda^{\prime}-\lambda=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}}{9.1 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg} \times 3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}(1-0.707) \\
=0.2429 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~m} \times 0.293 \\
\lambda^{\prime}-\lambda=0.0007 \mathrm{~nm} \\
\lambda^{\prime}=\lambda+0.0007 \mathrm{~nm} \\
\lambda^{\prime}=0.0248 \mathrm{~nm}+0.0007 \mathrm{~nm}=0.0255 \mathrm{~nm}
\end{gathered}
$$

# Pair Production

In the previous sections you have studied that a low energy photon interacting with a metal is usually completely absorbed with the emission of electron (Photoelectric effect) and a high energy photon such as that of X-rays is scattered by an atomic electron transferring a part of its energy to the electron (Compton effect). A third kind of interaction of very high energy photon such as that of $\gamma$-rays with matter is pair production in which photon energy is changed into an electron-positron pair. A positron is a particle having mass and charge equal to that of electron but the charge being of opposite nature i.e. positive. The creation of two particles with equal and opposite charges is essential for charge conservation in the universe. The positron is also known as antiparticle of electron or anti-electron. The interaction usually takes place in the electric field in the vicinity of a heavy nucleus as shown in the Fig. 19.10 so that there is a particle to take up recoil energy and momentum is conserved.
In the process, radiant energy is converted into matter in accordance with Einstein's equation $E=m c^{2}$, and hence, is also known as materialization of energy. For an electron or positron, the rest mass energy $=m_{e} c^{2}=0.51 \mathrm{MeV}$. Thus to create the two particles $2 \times 0.51 \mathrm{MeV}$ or 1.02 MeV energy is required. For photons of energy greater than 1.02 MeV , the probability of pair production occurrence increases as the energy increases and the surplus energy is carried off by the two particles in the form of kinetic energy. The process can be represented by the equation
Energy of photon $=\left[\begin{array}{l}\text { Energy required } \\ \text { for pair production }\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{l}\text { Kinetic energy } \\ \text { of the particles }\end{array}\right]$

$$
\mathrm{h} f=2 m_{0} c^{2}+\mathrm{K} . \mathrm{E} .\left(\mathrm{e}^{-}\right)+\mathrm{K} . \mathrm{E} .\left(\mathrm{e}^{+}\right)
$$
