### 20.4 UNCERTAINTY WITHIN THE ATOM

One of the characteristics of dual nature of matter is a fundamental limitation in the accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle.
Heisenberg showed that this is given by the equation

$$
\Delta p \Delta x \geq \frac{h}{2 \pi}
$$

However, these limitations are significant in the realm of atom. One interesting question is whether electrons are present in atomic nuclei. As the typical nuclei are loss than $10^{-14} \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter, for an electron to be confined within such a nucleus, the uncertainty in its position is of the order of $10^{-14} \mathrm{~m}$. The corresponding uncertainty in the electron's momentum is

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{\Delta x} \\
\geq \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}}{10^{-14} \mathrm{~m}}=6.63 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
\Delta v=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{9.11 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{~kg}} \geq 7.3 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
\end{gathered}
$$

Hence, for the electron to be confined to a nucleus, its speed would have to be greater than $10^{10} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ i.e., greater than the speed of light. Because this is impossible, we must conclude that an electron can never be found inside of a nucleus. But can an electron reside inside the atom? To find this, we again calculate the speed of an electron and if it turns to be less than the speed of light, we have reasonable expectation of finding the electron within the atom but outside the nucleus. The radius of the hydrogen atom is about $5 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~m}$. Applying the uncertainty principle to the momentum of electron in the atom we have

As

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{\Delta x} \\
& \Delta p=m \Delta v \\
& \Delta v=\frac{h}{m \Delta x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore,

For an atom $\Delta x$ is given as $5 \times 10^{-1} \mathrm{~m}$
Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta v & =\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{Js}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg} \times 5 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~m}} \\
& =1.46 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

This speed of the electron is less than the speed of light, therefore, it can exist in the atom but outside the nucleus.

# 20.5 LASER

Laser is the acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. As the name indicates, lasers are used for producing an intense, monochromatic, and unidirectional coherent beam of visible light. To understand the working of a laser, terms such as stimulated emission and population inversion must be understood.

## Spontaneous and Stimulated Emissions

Consider a sample of free atoms some of which are in the ground state with energy $E_{1}$ and some in the excited state $E_{2}$ as shown in Fig. 20.9. The photons of energy h $f=E_{2}-E_{1}$ are incident on this sample. These incident photons can interact with atoms in two different ways. In Fig. 20.9 (a) the incident photon is absorbed by an atom in the ground state $E_{1}$, thereby leaving the atom in the excited state $E_{2}$. This process is called stimulated or induced absorption. Once in the excited state, two things can happen to the atom. (i) It may decay by spontaneous emission as shown in Fig. 20.9 (b), in which the atom emits a photon of energy h $f=E_{2}-E_{1}$ in any arbitrary direction.

The other alternative for the atom in the excited state $E_{2}$ is to decay by stimulated or induced emission as shown in Fig. 20.9 (c). In this case the incident photon of energy h $f=E_{2}-E_{1}$ induces the atom to decay by emitting a photon that travels in the direction of the incident photon. For each incident photon we will have two photons going in the same direction thus we have accomplished two things; an amplified as well as a unidirectional coherent beam. From a practical point this is possible only if there is more stimulated or induced emission than spontaneous emission. This can be achieved as described in the next section.
Fig 20.9

# Population Inversioq and Lasey Action

Let us consider a simple case of a material whose atoms can reside in three different states as shown in Fig. 20.10, state
Fig. 20.10
$E$, which is ground state; the excited state $E_{1}$, in which the
atoms can reside only for $10^{-5} \mathrm{~s}$ and the metastable state $E_{1}$, in which the atoms can reside for $\sim 10^{-5} \mathrm{~s}$, much longer than $10 \mathrm{~s}$. A metastable state is an excited state in which an excited electron is unusually stable and from which the electron spontaneously falls to lower state only after relatively longer time. The transition from or to this state are difficult as compared to other excited states. Hence, instead of direct excitation to this state, the electrons are excited to higher level for spontaneous fall to metastable state. Also let us assume that the incident photons of energy h $f=E_{1}-E$, raise the atom from the ground state $E$, to the excited state $E_{2}$, but the excited atoms do not decay back to $E_{1}$. Thus the only alternative for the atoms in the excited state $E_{1}$ is to decay spontaneously to state $E_{2}$, the atoms reach state $E_{2}$ much faster than they leave state $E_{2}$. This eventually leads to the situation that the state $E_{2}$ contains more atoms than state $E_{1}$. This situation is known as population inversion.

Once the population inversion has been reached, the lasing action of a laser is simple to achieve. The atoms in the metastable state $E_{2}$ are bombarded by photons of energy $\mathrm{h} f=E_{2}-E_{1}$, resulting in an induced emission, giving an intense, coherent beam in the direction of the incident photon.

The emitted photons must be confined in the assembly long enough to stimulate further emission from other excited atoms. This is achieved by using mirrors at the two ends of the assembly. One end is made totally reflecting, and the other end is partially transparent to allow the laser beam to escape (Fig.20.11). As the photons move back and forth between the reflecting mirrors they continue to stimulate other excited atoms to emit photons. As the process continues the number of photons multiply, and the resulting radiation is, therefore, much more intense and coherent than light from ordinary sources.

# Helium-Neon Laser

It is a most common type of lasers used in physics laboratories. Its discharge tube is filled with $85 \%$ helium and $15 \%$ neon gas. The neon is the lasing or active medium in this tube. By chance, helium and neon have nearly identical metastable states, respectively located 20.61 eV and 20.66 eV level. The high voltage electric discharge excites the electrons in some of the helium atoms to the 20.61 eV state. In this laser, population inversion in neon is achieved by direct collisions with same energy electrons of helium atoms. Thus excited helium atoms collide with neon atoms, each transferring its own 20.61 eV of energy to an electron in the neon atom along with 0.05 eV of K.E. from the moving atom. As a result, the electrons in neon atoms are raised to the 20.66 eV state. In this way, a population inversion is sustained in the neon gas relative to an energy level of 18.70 eV . Spontaneous emission from neon atoms initiate laser action and stimulated emission causes electrons in the neon to drop from 20.66 eV to the 18.70 eV level and red laser light of wavelength 632.8 nm corresponding to 1.96 eV energy is generated (Fig. 20.12).

## Uses of Laser in Medicine and Industry

1. Laser beams are used as surgical tool for "welding" detached retinas.
2. The narrow intense beam of laser can be used to destroy tissue in a localized area. Tiny organelles with a living cell have been destroyed by using laser to study how the absence of that organelle affects the behavior of the cell.
3. Finely focused beam of laser has been used to destroy cancerous and pre-cancerous cell.

The helium-neon laser beam is being used to diagnose diseases of the eye. The use of laser technology in the field of ophthalmology is widespread.

4. The heat of the laser seals off capillaries and lymph vessels to prevent spread of the disease.
5. The intense heat produced in small area by a laser beam is also used for welding and machining metals and for drilling tiny holes in hard materials.
6. The precise straightness of a laser beam is also useful to surveyors for lining up equipment especially in inaccessible locations.
7. It is potential energy source for inducing fusion reactions.
8. It can be used for telecommunication along optical fibres.
9. Laser beam can be used to generate threedimensional images of objects in a process called holography.

## SUMMARY

- When an atomic gas or vapours at less than atmospheric pressure is suitably excited, usually by passing electric current through it, the emitted radiation has a spectrum which contains certain specific wavelengths only.
- Postulates of Bohr's model of hydrogen atom are:
i. An electron, bound to the nucleus in an atom, can move around the nucleus in certain circular orbits without radiating. These orbits are called the discrete stationary states of the atom.
ii. Only those stationary states are allowed for which orbital angular momentum is equal to an integral multiple of h i.e., $m \nu r=\frac{\pi h}{2 \pi}$
iii. Whenever an electron makes a transition, i.e., jumps from high energy state $E_{n}$ to a lower energy state $E_{s}$, a photon of energy $h$ is emitted so that $h f=E_{n}-E_{s}$.
- The transition of electrons in the hydrogen or other light elements result in the emission of spectral lines in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet region of electromagnetic spectrum due to small energy differences in the transition levels.
- The X-rays emitted in inner shell transitions are called characteristic X-rays, because their energy depends upon the type of target material.
- The X-rays that are emitted in all directions and with a continuous range of frequencies are known as continuous X-rays.
- Laser is the acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.

The incident photon absorbed by an atom in the ground state $E_{1}$, thereby leaving the atom in the excited state $E_{2}$ is called stimulated or induced absorption.
Spontaneous or induced emission is that in which the atom emits a photon of energy $\mathrm{h} f=E_{2}-E_{1}$ in any arbitrary direction.
Stimulated or induced emission is that in which the incident photon of energy h $f=E_{2}-E_{1}$ induces the atom to decay by emitting a photon that travels in the direction of the incident photon. For each incident photon, we will have two photons going in the same direction giving rise to an amplified as well as a unidirectional coherent beam.
