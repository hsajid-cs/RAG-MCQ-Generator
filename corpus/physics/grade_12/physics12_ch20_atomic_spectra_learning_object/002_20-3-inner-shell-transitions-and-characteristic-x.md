### 20.3 INNER SHELL TRANSITIONS AND CHARACTERISTIC X-RAYS

The transitions of electrons in the hydrogen or other light elements result in the emission of spectral lines in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet region of electromagnetic spectrum due to small energy differences in the transition levels.

In heavy atoms, the electrons are assumed to be arranged in concentric shells labeled as $\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{L}, \mathrm{M}, \mathrm{N}, \mathrm{O}$ etc., the K shell being closest to the nucleus, the $L$ shell next, and so on (Fig. 20.6). The inner shell electrons are tightly bound and large amount of energy is required for their displacement from their normal energy levels. After excitation, when an atom returns to its normal state, photons of larger energy are emitted. Thus transition of inner shell electrons in heavy atoms gives rise to the emission of high energy photons or Xrays. These X-rays consist of series of specific wavelengths or frequencies and hence are called characteristic X-rays. The study of characteristic $X$-rays spectra has played a very important role in the study of atomic structure and the periodic table of elements.

# Production of X-rays

Fig. 20.7 shows an arrangement of producing X-rays. It consists of a high vacuum tube called X-ray tube. When the cathode is heated by the filament $F$, it emits electrons which are accelerated towards the anode T. If $V$ is the
potential difference between $C$ and $T$, the kinetic energy $K, E$. with which the electron strike the target is given by

$$
\text { K.E. }=\text { Ve }
$$

Suppose that these fast moving electrons of energy Ve strike a target made of tungsten or any other heavy element. It is possible that in collision, the electrons in the innermost shells, such as K or L , will be knocked out. Suppose that one of the electrons in the K shell is removed, thereby producing a vacancy or hole in that shell. The electron from the $L$ shell

Fig. 20.8
jumps to occupy the hole in the K shell, thereby emitting a photon of energy h $f_{h c}$ called the $\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{X}$-ray given by

$$
\mathrm{h} f_{\mathrm{kn}}=E_{\mathrm{k}}-E_{\mathrm{K}}
$$

It is also possible that the electron from the $M$ shell might also jump to occupy the hole in the K shell. The photons emitted are $\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{X}$-ray with energies

$$
h f_{k 2}=E_{k}-E_{k}
$$

these photons give rise to $\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{X}$-ray and so on.
The photons emitted in such transitions i.e., inner shell transitions are called characteristic X-rays, because their energies depend upon the type of target material.
The holes created in the $L$ and $M$ shells are occupied by transitions of electrons from higher states creating more X-rays. The characteristic X-rays appear as discrete lines on a continuous spectrum as shown in Fig. 20.8.

# The Continuous X-ray Spectrum

The continuous spectrum is due to an effect known as bremsstrahlung or braking radiation. When the fast moving electrons bombard the target, they are suddenly slowed down on impact with the target. We know that an accelerating charge emits electromagnetic radiation. Hence, these impacting electrons emit radiation as they are strongly decelerated by the target. Since the rate of deceleration is so large, the emitted radiation correspond to short wavelength and so the bremsstrahlung is in the X-ray region. In the case when the electrons lose all their kinetic energy in the first collision, the entire kinetic energy appears as a X-ray photon of energy $\mathrm{h} f_{\text {max }}$, i.e.,

$$
\mathrm{K} . \mathrm{E}=h f_{\text {max }}
$$

The wavelength $\lambda_{\text {min }}$ in Fig. 20.8 corresponds to frequency $f_{\text {max }}$. Other electrons do not lose all their energy in the first collision. They may suffer a number of collisions before coming to rest. This will give rise to photons of smaller energy or X-rays of longer wavelength. Thus the continuous spectrum is obtained due to deceleration of impacting electrons.

## Properties and Uses of X-rays

X-rays have many practical applications in medicine and industry. Because X-rays can penetrate several centimetres

into a solid matter, so they can be used to visualize the interiors of the materials opaque to ordinary light, such as fractured bones or defects in structural steel. The object to be visualized is placed between an X-ray source and a large sheet of photographic film; the darkening of the film is proportional to the radiation exposure. A crack or air bubble allows greater amount of X-rays to pass. This appears as a dark area on the photographic film. Shadow of bones appears lighter than the surrounding flesh. It is due to the fact that bones contain greater proportions of elements with high atomic number and so they absorb greater amount of incident X-rays than flesh. In flesh, light elements like carbon, hydrogen and oxygen predominate. These elements allow greater amount of incident X-rays to pass through them.

## CAT-Scanner

In the recent past, several vastly improved X-ray techniques have been developed. One widely used system is computerized axial tomography; the corresponding instrument is called CAT-Scanner. The X-ray source produces a thin fan-shaped beam that is detected on the opposite side of the subject by an array of several hundred detectors in a line. Each detector measures absorption of X-ray along a thin line through the subject. The entire apparatus is rotated around the subject in the plane of the beam during a few seconds. The changing reactions of the detector are recorded digitally; a computer processes this information and reconstructs a picture of different densities over an entire cross section of the subject. Density differences of the order of one percent can be detected with CAT-Scans. Tumors, and other anomalies much too small to be seen with older techniques can be detected.

## Biological Effects of X-rays

X-rays cause damage to living tissue. As X-ray photons are absorbed in tissues, they break molecular bonds and create highly reactive free radicals (such as H and OH ), which in turn can disturb the molecular structure of the proteins and especially the genetic material. Young and rapidly growing cells are particularly susceptible; hence X-rays are useful for selective destruction of cancer cells. On the other hand a cell may be damaged by radiation but survive, continue dividing and produce generation of defective cells. Thus X-rays can cause cancer. Even when the organism itself shows no apparent damage, excessive
