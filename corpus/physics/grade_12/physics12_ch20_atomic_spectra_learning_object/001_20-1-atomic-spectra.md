### 20.1 ATOMIC SPECTRA

When an atomic gas or vapour at much less than atmospheric pressure is suitably excited, usually by passing an electric current through it, the emitted radiation has a spectrum, which contains certain specific wavelengths only. An idealized arrangement for observing such atomic spectra is shown in Fig. 20.1. Actual spectrometer uses diffraction grating for better results.
The impression on the screen is in the form of lines if the slit in front of the source $S$ is narrow rectangle. It is for this reason that the spectrum is referred to as line spectrum.
The fact that the spectrum of any element contains wavelengths that exhibit definite regularities was utilized in the second half of the $19^{\circ}$ century in identifying different elements.

Fig. 20.1 Line spectrum of hydrogen
These regularities were classified into certain groups called the spectral series. The first such series was identified by J.J Balmer in 1885 in the spectrum of hydrogen. This series, called the Balmer series, is shown in Fig.20.2, and is in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The results obtained by Balmer were expressed in 1896 by J.R Rydberg in the following mathematical form

$$
\frac{1}{\lambda}=R_{H}\left(\frac{1}{2^{2}}-\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)
$$

where $R_{H}$ is the Rydberg's constant. Its value is $1.0974 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$. Since then many more series have been discovered and proved helpful in predicting the arrangement of the electrons in different atoms.

# Atomic Spectrum of Hydrogen

The Balmer series contain wavelengths in the visible portion of the hydrogen spectrum. The spectral lines of hydrogen in the ultraviolet and infrared regions fall into several other series. In the ultraviolet region, the Lyman series contains the wavelengths given by the formula

$$
\frac{1}{\lambda}=R_{H}\left(\frac{1}{1^{2}}-\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)
$$

where

$$
n=2,3,4, \ldots \ldots
$$

In the infrared region, three spectral series have been found whose lines have the wavelengths specified by the formulae:

The existence of these regularities in the hydrogen spectrum together with similar regularities in the spectra of more complex elements, proposes a definite test for any theory of atomic structure.

# 20.2 BOHR'S MODEL OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM

In order to explain the empirical results obtained by Rydberg, Neils Bohr, in 1913, formulated a model of hydrogen atom utilizing classical physics and Planck's quantum theory. This semi classical theory is based on the following three postulates:

Postulate I: An electron, bound to the nucleus in an atom, can move around the nucleus in certain circular orbits without radiating. These orbits are called the discrete stationary states of the atom.

Postulate II: Only those stationary orbits are allowed for which orbital angular momentum is equal to an integral multiple of $\frac{\mathrm{h}}{2 \pi}$ i.e.,

$$
m v r=\frac{\mathrm{nh}}{2 \pi}
$$

where $n=1,2,3, \ldots$ and $n$ is called the principal quantum number, $m$ and $v$ are the mass and velocity of the orbiting electron respectively, and $h$ is Planck's constant.

Postulate III: Whenever an electron makes a transition, that is, jumps from high energy state $E_{n}$ to a lower energy state $E_{p}$, a photon of energy $h$ fis emitted so that

$$
h f=E_{n}-E_{p}
$$

where $f=c / \lambda$ is the frequency of the radiation emitted.

# de-Broglie's Interpretation of Bohr's Orbits

At the time of formulation of Bohr's theory, there was no justification for the first two postulates, while Postulate III had some roots in Planck's thesis. Later on with the development of de Broglie's hypothesis, some justification could be seen in Postulate II as explained below:

(c)
Standing de Broglie waves of electrons around the circumference of Bohr orbits.
Consider a string of length $\ell$ as shown in Fig. 20.3 (a). If this is put into stationary vibrations, we must have $\ell=n \lambda$ where $n$ is an integer. Suppose that the string is bent into circle of radius $r$, as demonstrated for $n=3$ and $n=6$ in Fig. 20.3 (b) and (c), so that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell & =2 \pi r=n \lambda \\
\text { or } \quad \lambda & =\frac{2 \pi r}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

From de Broglie's hypothesis

$$
\lambda=\frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{m v}
$$

thus

$$
\frac{h}{m v}=\frac{2 \pi r}{n}
$$

or

$$
m v r=\frac{n h}{2 \pi}
$$

which is Postulate II.

## For You Information

The first Bohr orbit in the hydrogen atom has a radius $r_{1}=5.3 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}$. The second and third Bohr orbits have radii $r_{2}=4 r_{1}$ and $r_{3}=9 r_{1}$ respectively.

## Quantized Radii

Consider a hydrogen atom in which electron moving with velocity $v_{n}$ is in stationary circular orbit of radius $r_{n}$. From Eq. (20.6),

$$
v_{n}=\frac{n h}{2 \pi m r_{n}}
$$

For this electron to stay in the circular orbit, shown in Fig. 20.4, the centripetal force $F_{c}=\frac{m v_{n}^{2}}{r_{n}}$ is provided by the Coulomb's force $F_{x}=\frac{k e^{2}}{r_{n}^{2}}$, where $e$ is the magnitude of charge on electron as well as on the hydrogen nucleus consisting of a single proton. Thus,

$$
\frac{m v_{n}^{2}}{r_{n}}=\frac{k e^{2}}{r_{n}^{2}}
$$

where constant $k$ is equal to $\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}$.
After substituting for $v_{n}$ from Eq. 20.9, we have

$$
r_{n}=\frac{n^{2} h^{2}}{4 \pi^{2} k m e^{2}}=n^{2} r_{1}
$$

where $r_{1}=\frac{h^{2}}{4 \pi^{2} k m e^{2}}=0.053 \mathrm{~nm}$
This agrees with the experimentally measured values and is called the first Bohr orbit radius of the hydrogen atom. Thus according to Bohr's theory, the radii of different stationary orbits of the electrons in the hydrogen atom are given by

$$
r_{n}=r_{1}, 4 r_{1}, 9 r_{1}, 16 r_{1}, \ldots \ldots
$$

Substituting the value of $r_{n}$ from Eq. 20.11 in Eq. 20.9, the speed of electron in the nth orbit is

$$
v_{n}=\frac{2 \pi k e^{2}}{n h}
$$

## Quantized Energies

Let us now calculate the total energy $E_{n}$ of the electron in the Bohr orbit; $E_{n}$ is the sum of the kinetic energy K.E. and the potential energy U.i.e.,

$$
E_{n}=K \cdot E_{1}+U=\frac{1}{2} m v_{n}^{2}+\left(\frac{-k e^{2}}{r_{n}}\right)
$$

By rearranging Eq. (20.10), we get

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{1}{2} m v_{n}^{2}=\frac{k e^{2}}{2 r_{n}} \\
E_{n}=\frac{k e^{2}}{2 r_{n}} \frac{k e^{2}}{r_{n}}=\frac{k e^{2}}{2 r_{n}}
\end{gathered}
$$

By substituting the value of $r_{n}$ from Eq. (20.11), we have

$$
E_{n}=-\frac{1}{n^{2}}\left(\frac{2 \pi^{2} k^{2} m e^{4}}{h^{2}}\right)=\frac{E_{n}}{n^{2}}
$$

where

$$
E_{n}=\frac{2 \pi^{2} k^{2} m e^{4}}{h^{2}}=\text { constant }=13.6 \mathrm{eV}
$$

which is the energy required to completely remove an electron from the first Bohr orbit. This is called ionization energy. The ionization energy may be provided to the electron by collision with an external electron. The minimum potential through which this external electron should be accelerated so that it can supply the requisite ionization energy is known as ionization potential. Thus for $n=1,2,3, \ldots$ we get the allowed energy levels of a hydrogen atom to be

$$
E_{n}=-E_{0},-\frac{E_{0}}{4},-\frac{E_{0}}{9},-\frac{E_{0}}{16}, \ldots \ldots
$$

The experimentally measured value of the binding energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom is in perfect agreement with the value predicted by Bohr theory.
Normally the electron in the hydrogen atom is in the lowest energy state corresponding to $n=1$ and this state is called the ground state or normal state. When it is in higher orbit, it is said to be in the excited state. The atom may be exited by collision with externally accelerated electron. The potential through which an electron should be accelerated so that, on collision it can lift the electron in the atom from its ground state to some higher state, is known as excitation potential.

# Hydrogen Emission Spectrum

The results derived above for the energy levels along with Postulate III can be used to arrive at the expression for the wavelength of the hydrogen spectrum. Suppose that the electron in the hydrogen atom is in the excited state $n$ with

## Photon must have energy exactly equal to the energy difference between the two shells for excitation of an atom but an electron with $K . E$ greater that the required difference can excite the gas atoms.

energy $E_{n}$ and makes a transition to a lower state $p$ with energy $E_{p}$, where $E_{p}<E_{n}$, then
where

$$
E_{n}=-\frac{E_{0}}{n^{2}} \quad \text { and } \quad E_{p}=-\frac{E_{0}}{p^{2}}
$$

hence

$$
h f=-E_{n}\left(\frac{1}{n^{2}}-\frac{1}{p^{2}}\right)
$$

Substituting for $f=c / \lambda$ and rearranging

$$
\frac{1}{\lambda}=\frac{E_{0}}{h c}\left(\frac{1}{p^{2}}-\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)
$$

or

$$
\frac{1}{\lambda}=R_{H}\left(\frac{1}{p^{2}}-\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)
$$

where $R_{H}$ is the Rydberg constant given by the equation

$$
R_{H}=\frac{E_{0}}{h c}=1.0974 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}
$$

which agrees well with the latest measured value for hydrogen atom.
Eq. 20.17 reduces to the empirical result derived by Rydberg and given by Eq 20.1, provided that we substitute $p=2$ and $n=3,4,5, \ldots \ldots$ The different energy levels corresponding to Eq. 20.17 are shown in Fig. 20.5.

v_{1}=2.19 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
\end{gathered}
