### 12.6 ELECTRIC FLUX THROUGH A SURFACE ENCLOSING A CHARGE

Let us calculate the electric flux through a closed surface, in shape of a sphere of radius $r$ due to a point charge $q$

placed at the centre of sphere as shown in Fig. 12.14. To apply the formula $\Phi_{n}=E$. A for the computation of electric flux, the surface area should be flat. For this reason the total surface area of the sphere is divided into $n$ small patches with areas of magnitudes $\Delta A_{1}, \Delta A_{2}, \Delta A_{3}, \ldots \Delta A_{n}$. If $n$ is very large, each patch would be a flat element of area. The corresponding vector areas are $\Delta A_{1}, \Delta A_{2}, \Delta A_{3}, \ldots . \Delta A_{n}$ respectively. The direction of each vector area is along perpendicular drawn outward to the corresponding patch. The electric intensities at the centres of vector areas $\Delta A_{1}, \Delta A_{2}, \ldots \Delta A_{n}$ are $E_{1}, E_{2}, \ldots \ldots . E_{n}$ respectively.
According to Eq.12.12, the total flux passing through the closed surface is
$\Phi_{n}=E_{1}, \Delta A_{1}+E_{2}, \Delta A_{2}+E_{3}, \Delta A_{3}+\ldots \ldots+E_{n}, \Delta A_{n} \ldots$
The direction of electric intensity and vector area is same at each patch. Moreover, because of spherical symmetry, at the surface of sphere,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left|E_{1}\right|=\left|E_{2}\right|=\left|E_{3}\right| & =\ldots . .=\left|E_{n}\right|=E=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r^{2}} \\
\Phi_{n} & =E \Delta A_{1}+E \Delta A_{2}+E \Delta A_{3}+\ldots \ldots+E \Delta A_{n} \\
& =E \times\left(\Delta A_{1}+\Delta A_{2}+\Delta A_{3}+\ldots \ldots+\Delta A_{n}\right) \\
& =E \times(\text { total spherical surface area }) \\
& =\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r^{2}} \times 4 \pi r^{2} \\
\Phi_{n} & =\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{0}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now imagine that a closed surface $S$ is enclosing this sphere. It can be seen in Fig. 12.15 that the flux through the closed surface $S$ is the same as that through the sphere. So we can conclude that total flux through a closed surface does not depend upon the shape or geometry of the closed surface. It depends upon the medium and the charge enclosed.

# 12.7 GAUSS'S LAW

Suppose point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, \ldots \ldots, q_{n}$ are arbitrarily distributed in an arbitrary shaped closed surface as shown in Fig. 12.16. Using idea given in previous section, the electric flux passing through the closed surface is
Fig. 12.14 The total electric flux through the surface of the sphere due to a charge $q$ at its centre is $q / \varepsilon_{0}$.
Fig. 12.15
Fig. 12.16

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Phi_{x}=\frac{q_{1}}{\varepsilon_{0}}+\frac{q_{2}}{\varepsilon_{0}}+\frac{q_{3}}{\varepsilon_{0}}+\ldots \ldots+\frac{q_{n}}{\varepsilon_{0}} \\
& \Phi_{x}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}} \times\left(q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\ldots \ldots+q_{n}\right) \\
& \Phi_{x}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}} \times \text { (total charge enclosed by closed surface) } \\
& \Phi_{x}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}} \times Q
\end{aligned}
$$

where $Q=q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\ldots \ldots+q_{n}$ is the total charge enclosed by closed surface. Eq. 12.16 is mathematical expression of Gauss's law which can be stated as,
"The flux through any closed surface is $1 / \varepsilon_{0}$ times the total charge enclosed in it".

# 12.8 APPLICATIONS OF GAUSS'S LAW

Gauss's law is applied to calculate the electric intensity due to different charge configurations. In all such cases, an imaginary closed surface is considered which passes through the point at which the electric intensity is to be evaluated. This closed surface is known as Gaussian surface. Its choice is such that the flux through it can be easily evaluated. Next the charge enclosed by Gaussian surface is calculated and finally the electric intensity is computed by applying Gauss's law Eq.12.16. We will illustrate this procedure by considering some examples.

## (a) Intensity of Field Inside a Hollow Charged

Fig. 12.17

Suppose that a hollow conducting sphere of radius $R$ is given a positive charge $q$. We wish to calculate the field intensity first at a point inside the sphere.
Now imagine a sphere of radius $R<R$ to be inscribed within the hollow charged sphere as shown in Fig. 12.17. The surface of this sphere is the Gaussian surface. Let $\Phi$ be flux through this closed surface. It can be seen in the figure that the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surfaces is zero. Applying Gaussian law, we have

$$
\Phi_{x}=\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{0}}=0
$$

Since $\quad \Phi_{x}=E \cdot A=0$ as $A \neq 0$, therefore, $E=0$

Thus the interior of a hollow charged metal sphere is a field free region. As a consequence, any apparatus placed within a metal enclosure is "shielded" from electric fields.

## (b) Electric Intensity Due to an Infinite Sheet of Charge

Suppose we have a plane sheet of infinite extent on which positive charges are uniformly distributed. The uniform surface charge density is, say, $\sigma$. A finite part of this sheet is shown in Fig. 12.18. To calculate the electric intensity $E$ at a point $P$, close to the sheet, imagine a closed Gaussian surface in the form of a cylinder passing through the sheet, whose one flat face contains point $P$. From symmetry we can conclude that $\mathbf{E}$ points at right angle to the end faces and away from the plane. Since $\mathbf{E}$ is parallel to the curved surface of the cylinder, so there is no contribution to flux from the curved wall of the cylinder. While it will be, $E A+E A=2 E A$, through the two flat end faces of the closed cylindrical surface, where $A$ is the surface area of the flat faces (Fig. 12.18). As the charge enclosed by the closed surface is $\sigma A$, therefore, according to Gauss's law,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Phi_{c}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}} \times \text { charge enclosed by closed surface } \\
& \Phi_{c}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}} \times \sigma A
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore,

$$
2 E A=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}} \times \sigma A
$$

or

$$
E=\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_{0}}
$$

In vector form,

$$
\mathbf{E}=\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_{0}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is a unit vector normal to the sheet directed away from it.

## (c) Electric Intensity Between Two Oppositely Charged Parallel Plates

Suppose that two parallel and closely spaced metal plates of infinite extent separated by vacuum are given opposite charges. Under these conditions the charges are essentially concentrated on the inner surfaces of the plates. The field lines which originate on positive charges on the inner face of one plate, terminate on negative charges on the inner face of the other plate (Fig. 12.19). Thus the charges

## To eliminate stray electric field interference, circuits of sensitive electronics devices such as T.V and Computers are often enclosed within metal boxes.
Fig. 12.18 The closed surface is in the form of a cylinder whose one face contains the point $P$ at which electric intensity has to be determined.
Fig. 12.19 The lines of force between the plates are normal to the plates and are directed from the positive plate towards the negative one.

Fig 12.20 Dotted rectangle represents the cross section of Gaussian box with its top inside the upper metal plate and its bottom in the dielectric between the plates.
are uniformly distributed on the inner surface of the plate in a form of sheet of charges of surface density $\sigma=q / A$, where $A$ is the area of plate and $q$ is the amount of charge on either of the plates.
Imagine now, a Gaussian surface in the form of a hollow box with its top inside the upper metal plate and its bottom in the space between the plates as shown in Fig.12.20. As the field lines are parallel to the sides of the box, therefore, the flux through the sides is zero. The field lines are uniformly distributed on the lower bottom face and are directed normally to it. If $A$ is the area of this face and $E$ the electric intensity at its site, the flux through it would be $E A$. There is no flux through the upper end of the box because there is no field inside the metal plate. Thus the total flux $\Phi_{x}$ through the Gaussian surface is $E A$. The charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is $\sigma A$. Applying Gauss's law

$$
\Phi_{x}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}} \times \sigma A
$$

or

$$
E A=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}} \times \sigma A
$$

or

$$
E=\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_{0}}
$$

The field intensity is the same at all points between the plates. The direction of field is from positive to negative plate because a unit positive charge anywhere between the plates would be repelled from positive and attracted to negative plate and these forces are in the same direction. In vector form

$$
E=\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_{0}} \hat{r}
$$

where $\hat{r}$ is a unit vector directed from positive to negative plate.

# 12.9 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

Let us consider a positive charge $q_{n}$ which is allowed to move in an electric field produced between two oppositely charged parallel plates as shown in Fig. 12.21 (a). The positive charge will move from plate $B$ to $A$ and will gain $K . E$. If it is to be moved from $A$ to $B$, an external force is needed to make the charge move against the electric field and will gain P.E. Let us impose a condition that as the charge is moved from $A$ to $B$, it is moved keeping electrostatic equilibrium, i.e., it moves with uniform velocity. This condition could be achieved by applying a force $\mathbf{F}$ equal and opposite to $q_{n} \mathbf{E}$ at every point along its path

as shown in Fig. 12.21 (b). The work done by the external force against the electric field increases electrical potential energy of the charge that is moved.
Let $W_{A B}$ be the work done by the force in carrying the positive charge $q_{0}$ from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium. The change in its potential energy $\Delta U=W_{A B}$
or

$$
U_{B}-U_{A}=W_{A B}
$$

where $U_{A}$ and $U_{B}$, are defined to be the potential energies at points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
To describe electric field we introduce the idea of electric potential difference. The potential difference between two points $A$ and $B$ in an electric field is defined as the work done in carrying a unit positive charge from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium, that is,

$$
\Delta V=V_{B}-V_{A}=\frac{W_{A B}}{q_{0}}=\frac{\Delta U}{q_{0}}
$$

where $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ are defined electric potentials at point $A$ and $B$ respectively. Electric potential energy difference and electric potential difference between the points $A$ and $B$ are related as

$$
\Delta U=q_{0} \Delta V=W_{A B}
$$

Thus the potential difference between the two points can be defined as the difference of the potential energy per unit charge.
As the unit of P.E. is joule, Eq. 12.23 shows that the unit of potential difference is joule per coulomb. It is called volt such that,

$$
1 \text { volt }=\frac{1 \text { joule }}{1 \text { coulomb }}
$$

That is, a potential difference of 1 volt exists between two points if work done in moving a unit positive charge from one point to other, keeping equilibrium, is one joule.
In order to give a concept of electric potential at a point in an electric field, we must have a reference to which we assign zero electric potential. This point is usually taken at infinity. Thus in Eq. 12.23, if we take $A$ to be at infinity and choose $V_{A}=0$, the electric potential at $B$ will be $V_{B}=W_{a B} / q_{0}$ or dropping the subscripts.

$$
V=\frac{W}{q_{0}}
$$

Fig. 12.21 (b)
An ECG records the "voltage" between points on human skin generated by electrical process in the heart. This ECG is made in running position providing information about the heart's performance under stress.

In electroencephalography the potential differences created by the electrical activity of the brain are used for diagnosing abnormal behaviour.
which states that the electric potentlal at any point in an electric field is equal to work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point keeping it in equilibrium. It is to be noted that potential at a point is still potential difference between the potential at that point and potential at infinity. Both potential and potential differences are scalar quantities because both $W$ and $q_{n}$ are scalars.

## Electric Field as Potential Gradient

In this section we will establish a relation between electric intensity and potential difference. As a special case, let us consider the situation shown in Fig. 12.21 (b). The electric field between the two charged plates is uniform, let its value be $E$. The potential difference between $A$ and $B$ is given by the equation

$$
V_{B}-V_{A}=\frac{W_{A B}}{q_{B}}
$$

where $W_{A B}=F d=-q_{n} E d$ (the negative sign is needed because $F$ must be applied opposite to $q_{n} E$ so as to keep it in equilibrium). With this, Eq. 12.27 becomes

$$
V_{B}-V_{A}=-\frac{q_{B} E d}{q_{B}}=-E d
$$

$$
E=-\frac{\left(V_{B}-V_{A}\right)}{d}=-\frac{\Delta V}{d}
$$

If the plates $A \& B$ are separated by infinitesimally small distance $\Delta r$, the Eq. 12.28 is modified as

$$
E=-\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta r}
$$

The quantity $\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta r}$ gives the maximum value of the rate of change of potential with distance because the charge has been moved along a field line along which the distance $\Delta r$ between the two plates is minimum. It is known as potential gradient. Thus the electric intensity is equal to the negative of the gradient of potential. The negative sign indicates that the direction of $E$ is along the decreasing potential.
The unit of electric intensity from Eq. 12.29 is volt/metre which is equal to NC ${ }^{-1}$ as shown below:

$$
1 \frac{\text { volt }}{\text { metre }}=1 \frac{\text { joule/coulomb }}{\text { metre }}=1 \frac{\text { newton } \times \text { metre }}{\text { metre } \times \text { coulomb }}=1 \frac{\text { newton }}{\text { coulomb }}
$$

# Electric Potential at a Point due to a Point Charge

Let us derive an expression for the potential at a certain point in the field of a positive point charge $q$. This can be accomplished by bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point keeping the charge in equilibrium. The target can be achieved using Eq. 12.29 in the form $\Delta V=-E \Delta r$, provided electric intensity $E$ remains constant. However in this case $E$ varies inversely as square of distance from the point charge, it no more remains constant so we use basic principles to compute the electric potential at a point. The field is radial as shown in Fig. 12.22.

Let us take two points $A$ and $B$, infinitesimally close to each other, so that $E$ remains almost constant between them. The distance of points $A$ and $B$ from $q$ are $r_{A}$ and $r_{B}$ respectively and distance of midpoint of space interval between $A$ and $B$ is $r$ from $q$. Then according to Fig. 12.22,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& r_{A}=r_{A}+\Delta r \\
& \Delta r=r_{B}-r_{A}
\end{aligned}
$$

As $r$ represents mid point of interval between $A$ and $B$ so

$$
r=\frac{r_{A}+r_{B}}{2}
$$

The magnitude of electric intensity at this point is,

$$
E=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r^{2}}
$$

As the points $A$ and $B$ are very close then, as a first approximation, we can take the arithmetic mean to be equal o geometric mean which gives

$$
\frac{r}{r_{A}}=\frac{r_{B}}{r}
$$

Therefore,

$$
r^{2}=r_{A} r_{B}
$$

Thus, Eq. 12.33 can be written as

$$
E=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r_{A} r_{B}}
$$

Now, if a unit positive charge is moved from $B$ to $A$, the work lone is equal to the potential difference between $A$ and $B$,

$$
V_{A}-V_{B}=-E\left(r_{A}-r_{B}\right)
$$

Fig. 12.22

## Fish and other sea creatures produce electric fields in a variety of ways. Sharks have special organs, called the ampullae of Lorenzini, that are very sensitive to electric field and can detect potential difference of the order of nanovolt and can locate their prey very precisely.

Substituting value of $E$ from Eq.12.35,

$$
V_{A}-V_{B}=\frac{q}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{r_{B}-r_{A}}{r_{A} r_{B}}\right)
$$

$$
V_{A}-V_{B}=\frac{q}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{1}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{r_{B}}\right)
$$

To calculate absolute potential or potential at A , point B is assumed to be infinity point so that $V_{B}=0$ and hence

$$
\frac{1}{r_{B}}=\frac{1}{r_{a}}=\frac{1}{x}=0
$$

This gives,

$$
V_{A}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r_{A}}
$$

The general expression for electric potential $V_{r}$, at a distance $r$ from $q$ is,

$$
V_{r}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r}
$$

Example 12.3: Two opposite point charges, each of magnitude $q$ are separated by a distance $2 d$. What is the electric potential at a point $P$ mid-way between them?

# Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V^{*}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{d} \quad \& \quad V^{*}=-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{d} \\
& V=V^{*}+V^{*}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{d}-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{d}=0
\end{aligned}
$$

So potential at P due to opposite charges is zero.
