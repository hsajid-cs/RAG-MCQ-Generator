### 12.13 CAPACITOR

A capacitor is a device that can store charge. It consists of two conductors placed near one another separated by vacuum, air or any other insulator, known as dielectric. Usually the conductors are in the form of parallel plates, and the capacitor is known as parallel plate capacitor. When the plates of such a capacitor are connected to a battery of voltage $V$ (Fig.12.24), it establishes a potential difference of $V$ volts between the two plates and the battery places a charge $+Q$ on the plate connected with its positive terminal and a charge $-Q$ on the other plate, connected to its negative terminal. let $Q$ be the magnitude of the charge on either of the plates. It is found that

$$
Q \propto V \text { or } Q=C V \text { or } C=\frac{Q}{V}
$$

The proportionality constant $C$ is called the capacitance of the capacitor. As we shall see later, it depends upon the geometry of the plates and the medium between them. It is a measure of the ability of capacitor to store charge. The capacitance of a capacitor can be defined as the amount of charge on one plate necessary to raise the potential of that plate by one volt with respect to the other. The SI unit of capacitance is coulomb per volt, which because of its frequent use, is commonly called farad ( $F$ ), after the famous English scientist Faraday.
"The capacitance of a capacitor is one farad if a charge of one coulomb, given to one of the plates of a parallel plate capacitor, produces a potential difference of one volt between them".
