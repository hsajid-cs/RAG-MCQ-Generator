### 12.5 ELECTRIC FLUX

When we place an element of area in an electric field, some of the lines of force pass through it (Fig. 12.13 a).
The number of the field lines passing through a certain element of area is known as electric flux through that area. It is usually denoted by Greek letter $\Phi$. For example the flux $\Phi$ through the area A in Fig. 12.13 (a) is 4 while the flux through B is 2.
In order to give a quantitative meaning to flux, the field lines are drawn such that the number of field lines passing through

a unit area held perpendicular to field lines at a point represent the intensity $\mathbf{E}$ of the field at that point. Suppose at a given point the value of $\mathbf{E}$ is $4 \mathrm{NC}^{-1}$. This means that if $1 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ area is held perpendicular to field lines at this point, 4 field lines will pass through it. In order to establish relation between electric flux $\Phi_{+}$electric intensity $\mathbf{E}$ and area $\mathbf{A}$ we consider the Fig. 12.13 (b,c,d) which shows the three dimensional representation of the electric field lines due to a uniform electric field of intensity $\mathbf{E}$.
In Fig. 12.13 (b), area is held perpendicular to the field lines, then $E A_{1}$ lines pass through it. The flux $\Phi_{0}$ in this case is

$$
\Phi_{0}=E A_{1}
$$

where $A_{1}$ denotes that the area is held perpendicular to field lines. In Fig. 12.13 (c), area $A$ is held parallel to field lines and, as is obvious no lines cross this area, so that flux $\Phi_{0}$ in this case is

$$
\Phi_{0}=E A_{1}=0
$$

where $A_{1}$ indicates that $A$ is held parallel to the field lines. Fig. 12.13 (d) shows the case when $A$ is neither perpendicular nor parallel to field lines but is inclined at angle $\theta$ with the lines. In this case we have to find the projection of the area which is perpendicular to the field lines. The area of this projection, (Fig. 12.13 d ) is $A \cos \theta$. The flux $\Phi$ in this case is

$$
\Phi_{0}=E A \cos \theta
$$

Usually the element of area is represented by a vector area $\mathbf{A}$ whose magnitude is equal to the surface area $A$ of the element and whose direction is direction of normal to the area. The electric flux $\Phi_{0}$ through a patch of flat surface in terms of $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ is then given by

$$
\Phi_{0}=E A \cos \theta=\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{A}
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the field lines and the normal to the area.

Electric flux, being a scalar product, is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit is $\mathrm{Nm}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$.
