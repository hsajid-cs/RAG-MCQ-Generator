### 12.1 COULOMB'S LAW

We know that there are two kinds of charges, namely, positive and negative charges. The charge on an electron is assumed to be negative and charge on a proton is positive. Moreover, we also learnt that like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. Now we investigate the quantitative nature of these forces. The first measurement of the force between electric charges was made in 1874 AD by Charles Coulomb, a French military engineer. On the basis of these measurements, he deduced a law known as Coulomb's law. It states that

The force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. It is mathematically expressed as

$$
F \propto \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \quad \text { or } \quad F=k \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$

where $F$ is the magnitude of the mutual force that acts on each of the two point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}$ and $r$ is the distance between them. The force $F$ always acts along the line joining the two point charges (Fig. 12.1), $k$ is the constant of proportionality. Its value depends upon the nature of medium between the two charges and system of units in which $F, q$ and $r$ are measured. If the medium between the two point charges is free space and the system of units is SI, then $k$ is represented as

$$
k=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}
$$

where $\varepsilon_{0}$ is an electrical constant, known as permittivity of free space. In SI units, its value is $8.85 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{Nm}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{2}$. Substituting the value of $\varepsilon_{0}$ the constant

$$
k=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}=9 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{Nm}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{2}
$$

Thus Coulomb's force in free space is

$$
F=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$

As stated earlier, Coulombs' force is mutual force, it means that if $q_{1}$ exerts a force on $q_{2}$, then $q_{2}$ also exerts an equal and opposite force on $q_{1}$. If we denote the force exerted on $q_{2}$ by $q_{1}$ as $\mathbf{F}_{21}$ and that on charge $q_{1}$ due to $q_{2}$ as $\mathbf{F}_{12}$, then

$$
\mathbf{F}_{12}=-\mathbf{F}_{21}
$$

The magnitude of both these two forces is the same and is given by Eq. 12.3. To represent the direction of these forces we introduce unit vectors. If $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{1}$ to $q_{2}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{2}$ to $q_{1}$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathbf{F}_{21}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21} \\
& \mathbf{F}_{12}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

The forces $\mathbf{F}_{21}$ and $\mathbf{F}_{12}$ are shown in Fig. 12.2 (a \& b). It can be seen that $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21}=-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}$, so Eqs. 12.5 (a \& b) show that

$$
\mathbf{F}_{21}=-\mathbf{F}_{12}
$$

The sign of the charges in Eqs. 12.5 (a \& b) determine whether the forces are attractive or repulsive.
We shall now consider the effect of medium between the two charges upon the Coulomb's force. If the medium is an insulator, it is usually referred as dielectric. It has been found that the presence of a dielectric always reduces the electrostatic force as compared with that in free space by a certain factor which is a constant for the given dielectric. This constant is known as relative permittivity and is represented by $\varepsilon$. The values of relaiive permittivity of different dielectrics are given in Table 12.1.

Thus the Coulomb's force in a medium of relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{r}$ is given by

$$
\stackrel{\rightharpoonup}{F}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{r}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$

It can be seen in the table that $\varepsilon_{r}$ for air is 1.0006 . This value is so close to one that with negligible error, the Eq. 12.3 gives the electric force in air.

Example 12.1: Charges $q_{1}=100 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and $q_{2}=50 \mu \mathrm{C}$ are located in xy-plane at positions $\mathbf{r}_{1}=3.0 \mathrm{j}$ and $\mathbf{r}_{2}=4.0 \mathrm{i}$ respectively,

where the distances are measured in metres. Calculate the force on $q_{2}$ (Fig. 12.3).

Solution: $\quad q_{1}=100 \mu \mathrm{C}, \quad q_{2}=50 \mu \mathrm{C}$
Position vector of $q_{2}$ relative to $q$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =r_{21}=r_{2}-r_{1}=4 i-3 j \\
& r=\text { magnitude of } r_{21}=\sqrt{(4 m)^{2}+(-3 m)^{2}}=5 \mathrm{~m} \\
& \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21}=\frac{4 i-3 j}{5} \\
& \mathrm{~F}_{21}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21} \\
& 9 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{Nm}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{-2} \times 100 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C} \times 50 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C} \times 4 \mathrm{i}-3 \mathrm{j} \\
& =1.44 \mathrm{i}-1.08 \mathrm{j}

$$

Magnitude of $\mathrm{F}_{21}=F=\sqrt{(1.44)^{2}+(-1.08)^{2}}=1.8 \mathrm{~N}$
Direction of $\mathrm{F}_{21}=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{-1.08}{1.44}\right)=-37^{\circ}$ with $x$-axis

# 12.2 FIELDS OF FORCE

Newton's universal gravitational law and Coulomb's law enable us to calculate the magnitude as well as the directions of the gravitational and electric forces, respectively. However one may question, (a) What are the origins of these forces?
(b) How are these forces transmitted from one mass to another or from one charge to another?

The answer to (a) is still unknown; the existence of these forces is accepted as it is. That is why they are called basic forces of nature.
To describe the mechanism by which electric force is transmitted, Michael Faraday (1791-1867) introduced the concept of an electric field. According to his theory, it is the intrinsic property of nature that an electric field exists in the space around an electric charge. This electric field is considered to be a force field that exerts a force on other charges placed in that field. For example, a charge $q$ produces an electric field in the space surrounding it. This

field exists whether the other charges are present in space or not. However, the presence of field cannot be tested until another charge $q_{0}$ is brought into the field. Thus the field of charge $q$ interacts with $q_{0}$ to produce an electrical force. The interaction between $q$ and $q_{0}$ is accomplished in two steps: (a) the charge $q$ produces a field and (b) the field interacts with charge $q_{0}$ to produce a force $F$ on $q_{0}$. These two steps are illustrated in Fig. 12.4.
In this figure the density of dots is proportional to the strength of the field at the various points. We may define electric field strength or electric field intensity $E$ at any point in the field as

$$
E=\frac{F}{q_{0}}
$$

where $F$ is the force experienced by a positive test charge $q_{0}$ placed at the point. The test charge $q_{0}$ has to be very small so that it may not distort the field which it has to measure.
Since electric field intensity is force per unit charge, it is measured in newton per coulomb in SI units. It is a vector quantity and its direction is the same as that of the force $F$.
The force experienced by a test charge $q_{0}$ placed in the field of a charge $q$ in vacuum is given by Eq. (12.3). Eq. 12.7 can be used to evaluate electric intensity due to a point charge $q$ at a point distant $r$ from it. Place a positive test charge $q_{0}$ at this point. The Coulomb's force that this charge will experience due to $q$ is

$$
F=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q q_{0}}{r^{2}} \hat{r}
$$

where $\hat{r}$ is a unit vector directed from the point charge $q$ to the test point where $q_{0}$ has been placed, i.e., the point where the electric intensity is to be evaluated. By Eq. 12.7

$$
E=\frac{F}{q_{0}}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q q_{0}}{r^{2}} \hat{r} x \frac{1}{q_{0}}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r^{2}} \hat{r}
$$

Example 12.2: Two positive point charges $q_{1}=16.0 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and $q_{2}=4.0 \mu \mathrm{C}$ are separated by a distance of 3.0 m , as shown in Fig. 12.5. Find the spot on the line joining the two charges where electric field is zero.
Solution: Between the charges, the two field contribution has opposite directions, and electric field would be zero at a
Fig. 12.4 (a) Dots surrounding the positive charge indicate the presence of the electric field. The density of the dots is proportional to the strength of the electric field at different points. (b) Interaction of the field with the charge $q_{0}$
Fig. 12.5

Fig. 12.5 (a) A positive test charge $+q_{0}$ placed anywhere in the vicinity of a positive point charge $+q$, experiences a repulsive force directed radially outward. (b) the electric field lines are directed radially outward from the positive point charge $+q$.

point $P$, where the magnitude of $E_{1}$ equals that of $E_{2}$. In the Fig. 12.5, let the distance of $P$ from $q_{2}$ be $d$.
AtP, $\quad E_{1}=E_{2}, \quad$ which implies that,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1}}{(3.0-d)^{2}}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{2}}{d^{2}} \\
& \text { or } \quad \frac{16.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}}{9+d^{2}-6 d}=\frac{4.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}}{d^{2}} \\
& d^{2}+2 d-3=0, \quad \text { which gives } d=+1 \mathrm{~m},-3 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

There are two possible values of $d$, the negative value corresponds to a location off to the right of both the charges where magnitudes of $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are equal but directions are same. In this case $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ do not cancel at this spot. The positive value corresponds to the location shown in figure and is the zero field location, hence, $d=+1.0 \mathrm{~m}$.
