### 12.17 CHARGING AND DISCHARGING A CAPACITOR

Many electric circuits consist of both capacitors and resistors. Fig. 12.27 shows a resistor-capacitor circuit called R-C-circuit. When the switch $S$ is set at terminal $A$, the $R-C$ combination is connected to a battery of voltage $V_{c}$ which starts charging the capacitor through the resistor $R$.
The capacitor is not charged immediately, rather charges build up gradually to the equilibrium value of $q_{c}=C V_{e}$. The growth of charge with time for different resistances is shown in Fig.12.28. According to this graph $q=0$ at $t=0$ and increases gradually with time till it reaches its equilibrium value $q_{c}=C V_{c}$. The voltage $V$ across capacitor at any instant can be obtained by dividing $q$ by $C$, as $V=q / C$.
How fast or how slow the capacitor is charging or discharging, depends upon the product of the resistance $R$ and the capacitance $C$ used in the circuit. As the unit of product $R C$ is that of time, so this product is known as time constant and is defined as the time required by the capacitor to deposit 0.63 times the equilibrium charge $q_{c}$. The graphs of Fig. 12.28 show that the charge reaches its equilibrium value sooner when the time constant is small.
Fig. 12.29(a) illustrates the discharging of a capacitor through a resistor. In this figure, the switch $S$ is set at point $B$, so the charge $+q$ on the left plate can flow anti-clockwise through the resistance and neutralize the charge $-q$ on the right plate.
The graphs in Fig. 12.29(b) shows that discharging begins at $t=0$ when $q=C V_{c}$ and decreases gradually to zero. Smaller values of time constant $R C$ lead to a more rapid discharge.

Example 12.6: The time constant of a series RC circuit is $t=R C$. Verify that an ohm times farad is equivalent to second.
Solution: Ohm's law in terms of potential difference $V$, current $I$ and resistance $R$ can be written as,

$$
V=I R
$$

Putting $I=q / t$, this equation transforms into the equation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
V & =\frac{q}{t} R \\
R & =\frac{V \times t}{q}
\end{aligned}
$$

According to equation $q=C V, C=q / V$
Multiplying this equation with above equation gives,

$$
R C=\frac{V \times t}{q} \times \frac{q}{V}=t
$$

Hence $\quad 1$ ohm $\times 1$ farad $=1$ second
where ohm is the unit of resistance $R$.

## SUMMARY

- The Coulomb's law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
- Electric field force per unit charge at a point is called electric field strength or electric field intensity at that point.
- The number of the field lines passing through a certain element of area is known as electric flux through that area, denoted by $\Phi$.
- The electric flux $\Phi$ through a vector area $\mathbf{A}$, in the electric field of intensity $\mathbf{E}$ is given by $\Phi=\mathbf{E} . \mathbf{A}=E A \cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the field lines and the normal to surface area.
- Gauss's law is stated as "the flux through any closed surface is $1 / \varepsilon_{0}$ times the total charge enclosed in it.
- The interior of a hollow charged metal sphere is a field free region.
- The electric intensity between two oppositely charged parallel plates is $E=\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_{0}}$.
- The amount of work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to a point against electric field is the electric potential at that point.

- Capacitance of a capacitor is a measure of the ability of a capacitor to store charge.
- The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is $C_{\text {rac }}=\frac{Q}{V}=\frac{A E_{0}}{d}$.
- The increase in the capacitance of a capacitor due to presence of dielectric is due to electric polarization of the dielectric.
