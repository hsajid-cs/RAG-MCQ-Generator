### 12.10 ELECTRON VOLT

Referring Fig. 12.21, we know that when a particle of charge $q$ moves from point $A$ with potential $V_{A}$ to a point $B$ with potential $V_{B}$, keeping electrostatic equilibrium, the change in potential energy $\Delta U$ of particle is,

$$
\Delta U=q\left(V_{B}-V_{A}\right)=q \Delta V
$$

If no external force acts on the charge to maintain equilibrium, this change in P.E. appears in the form of change in K.E. Suppose charge carried by the particle is $q=e=1.6 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{C}$.

Thus, in this case, the energy acquired by the charge will be

$$
\Delta K \cdot E=q \Delta V=e \Delta V=\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right)(\Delta V)
$$

Moreover, assume that $\Delta V=1$ volt, hence

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Delta K \cdot E=q \Delta V=\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right) \times(1 \text { volt }) \\
\Delta K \cdot E=\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right) \times(C \times V)=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}
\end{gathered}
$$

The amount of energy equal to $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}$ is called one electron-volt and is denoted by 1 eV . It is defined as "the amount of energy acquired or lost by an electron as it traverses a potential difference of one volt". Thus,

$$
1 \mathrm{eV}=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}
$$

Example 12.4: A particle carrying a charge of 2 e falls through a potential difference of 3.0 V . Calculate the energy acquired by it.
Solution: $\quad q=2 \mathrm{e}, \quad \Delta V=3.0 \mathrm{~V}$
The energy acquired by the particle is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta K \cdot E=q \Delta V & =(2 e)(3.0 \mathrm{~V})=6.0 \mathrm{eV} \\
& =6.0 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}=9.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 12.11 ELECTRIC AND GRAVITATIONAL FORCES (A COMPARISON)

In chapter 4, we pointed out that gravitational force is a conservative force, that is, work done in such a field is independent of path. It can also be proved that Coulomb's electrostatic force is also conservative force. The electric force between two charges $F=\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0} r^{2}}$, is similar in form to the gravitational force between the two point masses, $F=G \frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{r^{2}}$. Both forces vary inversely with the square of the distance between the two charges or the two masses. However, the value of gravitational constant $G$ is very small as compared to electrical constant $\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}$. It is because of this fact that the gravitational force is a very weak force as compared to electrostatic force. As regards their qualitative aspect, the electrostatic force could be attractive or repulsive while, on the other hand, gravitational force is only attractive. Another difference to be noted is that the electrostatic force is medium dependant and can be shielded while gravitational

# 12.12 CHARGE ON AN ELECTRON BY MILLIKAN'S METHOD

In 1909, R.A Millikan devised a technique that resulted in precise measurement of the charge on an electron.
Fig. 12.23 (a)
A schematic diagram of the Millikan oil drop experiment is shown in Fig. 12.23 (a). Two parallel plates $P P^{\prime}$ are placed inside a container $C$, to avoid disturbances due to air currents. The separation between the plates is $d$. The upper plate $P$ has a small hole $H$, as shown in the figure. A voltage $V$ is applied to the plates due to which the electric field $E$ is setup between the plates. The magnitude of its value is $E=V / d$. An atomizer $A$ is used for spraying oil drops into the container through a nozzle. The oil drop gets charged because of friction between walls of atomizer and oil drops. These oil drops are very small, and are actually in the form of mist. Some of these drops happen to pass through the hole in the upper plate. The space between the plates is illuminated by the light coming from the source $S$ through the lens $L$ and window $\mathrm{W}_{1}$. The path of motion of these drops can be carefully observed by a microscope $M$.
A given droplet between the two plates could be suspended in air if the gravitational force $F_{g}=m g$ acting on the drop is equal to the electrical force $F_{e}=q E$, as shown in Fig. 12.23(b). The $F_{e}$ can be adjusted equal to $F_{g}$ by adjusting the voltage. In this case, we can write,

$$
F_{e}=F_{g}
$$

or

$$
q E=m g
$$

If $V$ is the value of $p$. $d$. between the plates for this setting, then

$$
\begin{gathered}
E=\frac{V}{d}, \quad \text { we may write } \quad q \frac{V}{d}=m g \\
q=\frac{m g d}{V}
\end{gathered}
$$

In order to determine the mass $m$ of the droplet, the electric field between the plates is switched off. The droplet falls under the action of gravity through air. It attains terminal speed $v$, almost at the instant the electric field is switched off. Its terminal speed $v_{t}$ is determined by timing the fall of the droplet over a measured distance. Since the drag force $F$ due to air acting upon the droplet when it is falling with constant terminal speed is equal to its weight. Hence, using Stokes's law

$$
F=6 \pi \eta r v_{t}=m g
$$

where $r$ is the radius of the droplet and $\eta$ is the coefficient of viscosity for air. If $p$ is the density of the droplet, then

$$
m=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{2} \rho
$$

Hence.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{2} \rho g & =6 \pi \eta r v_{t} \\
r^{2} & =\frac{9 \eta v_{t}}{2 \rho g}
\end{aligned}
$$

Knowing the value of $r$, the mass $m$ can be calculated by using Eq. (12.45). This value of $m$ is substituted in Eq. 12.44 to get the value of charge $q$ on the droplet.
Millikan measured the charge on many drops and found that each charge was an integral multiple of a minimum value of charge equal to $1.6 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{C}$. He, therefore, concluded that this minimum value of the charge is the charge on an electron.
Example 12.5: In Millikan oil drop experiment, an oil drop of mass $4.9 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{~kg}$ is balanced and held stationary by the electric field between two parallel plates. If the potential difference between the plates is 750 V and the spacing between them is 5.0 mm , calculate the charge on the droplet. Assume $g=9.8 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$.

# Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Mass of drop }=m=4.9 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{~kg} \\
& \text { Potential difference }=V=750 \mathrm{~V} \\
& \text { Spacing between plates }=d=5.0 \mathrm{~mm}=5.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

For Your Information
One farad is an enormous amount of capacitance. For practical purposes its sub-multiple units are used which are given below,

1 micro-farad $=1 \mu \mathrm{~F}=10^{4}$ farad
1 pico-farad $=1 \mathrm{pF}=10^{-4}$ farad

For the droplet of the charge $q$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& q=\frac{m g d}{V}=\frac{4.9 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \times 5.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}}{750 \mathrm{~V}} \\
& q=3.2 \times 10^{19} \mathrm{C}
