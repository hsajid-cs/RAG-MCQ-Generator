### 12.14 CAPACITANCE OF A PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITOR

Consider a parallel plate capacitor consisting of two plane metal plates, each of area $A$, separated by a distance $d$ as shown in Fig. 12.24. The distance $d$ is small so that the electric field $E$ between the plates is uniform and confined

almost entirely in the region between the plates. Let initially the medium between the plates be air or vacuum. Then according to Eq. 12.46,

$$
C_{\text {vac }}=\frac{Q}{V}
$$

where $Q$ is the charge on the capacitor and $V$ is the potential difference between the parallel plates. The magnitude $E$ of electric intensity is related with the distance $d$ by Eq. 12.28 as

$$
E=\frac{V}{d}
$$

As $Q$ is the charge on either of the plates of area $A$, the surface density of charge on the plates is as

$$
\sigma=\frac{Q}{A}
$$

As already shown in section 12.8, the electric intensity between two oppositely charged plates is given by $E=\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_{0}}$
Substituting the value of $\sigma$, we have

$$
\frac{V}{d}=\frac{Q}{A \varepsilon_{0}}
$$

It gives

$$
C_{\text {vac }}=\frac{Q}{V}=\frac{A \varepsilon_{0}}{d}
$$

If an insulating material, called dielectric, of relative permittivity $\varepsilon$, is introduced between the plates, the capacitance of capacitor is enhanced by the factor $\varepsilon_{r}$. Capacitors commonly have some dielectric medium, thereby $\varepsilon_{i}$ is also called as dielectric constant.
Following experiment gives the effect of insertion of dielectric between the plates of a capacitor.
Consider a charged capacitor whose plates are connected to a voltmeter (Fig. 12.25 a). The deflection of the meter is a measure of the potential difference between the plates. When a dielectric material is inserted between the plates, reading drops indicating a decrease in the potential difference between the plates (Fig. 12.25 b). From the definition, $C=Q / V$, since $V$ decreases while $Q$ remains constant, the value of $C$ increases. Then Eq. 12.50 becomes,

$$
C_{\text {med }}=\frac{A \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{r}}{d}
$$

The electric field lines between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor. Smell bits of thread are suspended in oil and become aligned with the electric field. Note that the lines are equally spaced, indicating that the electric field there is uniform.
Fig. 12.25 Effect of a dielectric on the capacitance of a capacitor.

Eq. 12.50 shows the dependence of a capacitor upon the area of plates, the separation between the plates and medium between them.

Dividing Eq. 12.51 by Eq. 12.50 we get expression for dielectric constant as,

$$
\varepsilon_{r}=\frac{C_{\text {med }}}{C_{\text {vac }}}
$$

From Eq. 12.52 dielectric co-efficient or dielectric constant is defined as
"The ratio of the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor with an insulating substance as medium between the plates to its capacitance with vacuum (or air) as medium between them".

# 12.15 ELECTRIC POLARIZATION OF DIELECTRICS

The increase in the capacity of a capacitor due to presence of dielectric is due to electric polarization of dielectric.
The dielectric consists of atoms and molecules which are electrically neutral on the average, i.e, they contain equal amounts of negative and positive charges. The distribution of these charges in the atoms and molecules is such that the centre of the positive charge coincides with the centre of negative charge. When the molecules of dielectric are subjected to an electric field between the plates of a capacitor, the negative charges (electrons) are attracted towards the positively charged plate of the capacitor and the positive charges (nuclei) towards the negatively charged plate. The electrons in the dielectric (insulator) are not free to move but it is possible that the electrons and nuclei can undergo slight displacement when subjected to an electric field. As a result of this displacement the centre of positive and negative charges now no longer coincide with each other and one end of molecules shows a negative charge and the other end, an equal amount of positive charge but the molecule as a whole is still neutral. Two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance are said to constitute a dipole. Thus the molecules of the dielectric under the action of electric field become dipoles and the dielectric is said to be polarized.
The effect of the polarization of dielectric is shown in

Fig. 12.26. The positively charged plate attracts the negative end of the molecular dipoles and the negatively charged plate attracts the positive end. Thus the surface of the dielectric which is in contact with the positively charged plate places a layer of negative charges on the plate. Similarly the surface of the dielectric in contact with the negatively charged plate places a layer of positive charges. It effectively decreases the surface density of the charge $\sigma$ on the plates. As the electric intensity $E$ between the plates is $\frac{\sigma}{E_{0}}$, so $E$ decreases due to
Fig. 12.26
polarization of the dielectric. This results into a decrease of potential difference between the plates due to presence of dielectric as demonstrated by the experiment described in the previous section.

# 12.16 ENERGY STORED IN A CAPACITOR

A capacitor is a device to store charge. Alternatively, it is possible to think of a capacitor as a device for storing electrical energy. After all, the charge on the plate possesses electrical potential energy which arises because work is to be done to deposit charge on the plates. This is due to the fact that with each small increment of charge being deposited during the charging process, the potential difference between the plates increases, and a larger amount of work is needed to bring up next increment of charge.
Initially when the capacitor is uncharged, the potential difference between plates is zero and finally it becomes $V$ when $q$ charge is deposited on each plate. Thus, the average potential difference is $\frac{0+V}{2}=\frac{1}{2} V$
Therefore

$$
\text { P.E. }=\text { Energy }=\frac{1}{2} q V
$$

Using the relation $q=C V$ for capacitor we get

$$
\text { Energy }=\frac{1}{2} C V^{2}
$$

It is also possible to regard the energy as being stored in electric field between the plates, rather than the potential energy of the charges on the plates. Such a view point is useful when electric field strength between the plates instead of charges on the plates causing field is to be considered. This relation can be obtained by substituting $V=E d$ and $C=A \varepsilon_{r} c_{0} / d$ in Eq.12.53,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Energy } & =\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{A \varepsilon_{r} \varepsilon_{c}}{d}\right)(E d)^{2} \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{r} \varepsilon_{c} E^{2} \times(A d)
\end{aligned}
$$

As $(A d)$ is volume between the plates so
Energy density $=\frac{\text { Energy }}{\text { Volume }}=\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{r} \varepsilon_{c} E^{2}$
This equation is valid for any electric field strength.
