### 21.15 BUILDING BLOCKS OF MATTER

According to standard model of particle Physics, subatomic particles can be classified into four groups:
(i) Hadrons (ii) Leptons (iii) Gauge boson (iv) Higgs boson

Quarks and Antiquarks

| Name | Symbol | Charge |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Up | $u$ | $+10$ |
| Down | $d$ | $+10$ |
| Strange | $s$ | $+10$ |

Elementary particles are the basic building blocks of matter. All photons and leptons are elementary particles. Hadrons are not elementary particles but are composed of elementary particles called quarks. It is now believed that stable matter can be described using six quarks, six leptons and their antiparticles.

## Hadrons

Hadrons are particles that experience the strong nuclear force. In addition to protons, neutrons and mesons are hadrons. The particles equal in mass or greater than protons are called baryons and those lighter than protons are called mesons. A pair of quark and antiquark makes a meson and 3 quarks make a baryon. It is proposed that there are six quarks, (1) up (2) down (3) strange (4) charm (5) bottom and (6) top. The charges on these quarks are fractional as shown in Table 21.5.

A proton is assumed to be made up of two up quarks and one down quark as shown in Fig. 21.18 (a). The neutron is assumed to be made of one up quarks and two down quarks as shown in Fig. 21.18 (b).

## Leptons

Leptons are particles that do not experience strong nuclear force. Electrons, muons, tau and their associated neutrinos are called leptons.

## Guage boson

They are believed to be the exchange particles or carriers of basic forces of nature. For example, photons are the carriers of electromagnetic force, the gluons glue the quarks in the protons and neutrons and hold the nucleus together. The $\mathrm{W}^{\prime}$, $\mathrm{W}^{\prime}$ and Z bosons are the exchange particles of elctro weak force. Currently, the standard model does not explain the gravity or its associated particle graviton.

## Higgs boson

Higgs boson, discovered in July, 2012, provides an explanation for how the other particles get mass by interacting with it.

# SUMMARY

- The combined number of all the protons and neutrons in a nucleus is known as mass number and is denoted by $A$.
- The protons and neutrons present in the nucleus are called nucleons.
- The number of neutrons present in a nucleus is called its neutron number and is denoted by N .
- The number of protons inside a nucleus or the number of electrons outside of the nucleus is called the atomic number or the charge number of an atom and is denoted by $Z$.
- Isotopes are such nuclei of an element that have the same charge number $Z$, but have different mass number $A$.
- The emission of radiations ( $\alpha, \beta$ and $\gamma$ ) form elements having charge number $Z$ greater than 82 is called radioactivity.
- The change of an element into a new element due to emission of radiations is called radioactive decay. The original element is called parent element and the element formed due to this decay is called daughter element
- Half-life of a radioactive element is that period in which half of the atoms of the parent element decay into daughter element.
- Such a reaction is which a heavy nucleus like uranium splits up into two nuclei of equal size along with the emission of energy during reaction is called fission reaction.
- Such a nuclear reaction in which two light nuclei merge to form a heavy nucleus along with the emission of the energy is called fusion reaction.
- The strength of the radiation source is indicated by its activity measured in becquerel. One becquerel (Bq) is one disintegration per second. A large unit is curie (Ci) which equals $3.7 \times 10^{10}$ disintegrations per second.
- The effect of radiation on a body absorbing it relates to a quantity called absorbed dose D defined as the energy E absorbed from ionizing radiation per unit mass $m$ of the absorbing body.
- The basic forces are:
i. Gravitational force ii. Electromagnetic force
iii. Weak nucleus force iv. The strong force
- Subatomic particles are classified into four groups:
i. Hadrons ii. Leptons
iii. Gauge boson iv. Higgs boson

Elementary particles are the basic building blocks of matter.
