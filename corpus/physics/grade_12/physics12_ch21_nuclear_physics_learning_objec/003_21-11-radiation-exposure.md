### 21.11 RADIATION EXPOSURE

When a Geiger tube is used in any experiment, it records radiation even when a radioactive source is nowhere near it. This is caused by radiation called background radiation. It is partly due to cosmic radiation which comes to us from outer space and partly from naturally occurring radioactive substance in the Earth's crust. The cosmic radiation consists of high energy charged particles and electromagnetic radiation. The atmosphere acts as a shield to absorb some of these radiations as well as ultraviolet rays. In recent past, the depletion of ozone layer in the upper atmosphere has been detected which particularly filters ultraviolet rays reaching us. This may result in increased eye and skin diseases. The depletion of ozone layer is suspected to be caused due to excessive release of some chemicals in the atmosphere such as chloroflourocarbons (CFC) used in refrigeration, aerosol spray and plastic foam industry. Its use is now being replaced by environmentally friendly chemicals. Many building materials contain small amounts of radioactive isotopes. Radioactive radon gas enters buildings from the ground. It gets trapped inside the building which makes radiation levels much higher from radon inside than outside. A good ventilation can reduce radon level inside the building. All types of food also contain a little radioactive substance. The most common are potassium- 40 and carbon- 14 isotopes.
Some radiation in the environment is added by human activities. Medical practices, mostly diagnostic X-ray probably contribute the major portion to it. It is an unfortunate fact that many X-ray exposures such as routine chest X-ray

hospitals, research and industrial establishments, colour television, luminous watches and tobacco leaves. A smoker not only inhales toxic smoke but also hazardous radiation. Low level background radiation from natural sources is normally considered to be harmless. However, higher levels of exposure are certainly damaging. We cannot avoid exposure to radiation. However, the best advice is to avoid unnecessary exposure to any kind of ionizing radiation.

# 21.12 BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF RADIATION

## Table 21.2

Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE)

| Radiation | RBE |
| :-- | :-- |
| X-rays, y-rays and o-particles | 1.0 |
| of 30 keV or more | 1.7 |
| o-particles of less than 30 keV | 10 (body) |
| Neutrons and protons below 10 | 30 (eyes) |
| MeV | 10 |
| o-particles from natural | 20 |
| radioactivity |  |

To study the effects of radiation, we need to define some of the units of radiation. The strength of the radiation source is indicated by its activity measured in becquerel (Bq). One becquerel is one disintegration per second. A larger unit is curie (Ci) which equals $3.7 \times 10^{10}$ disintegrations per second. The effect of radiation on a body absorbing it relates to a quantity called absorbed dose $D$ defined as the energy $E$ absorbed from ionizing radiation per unit mass $m$ of the absorbing body.

$$
D=\frac{E}{m}
$$

Its SI unit is gray (Gy) defined as one joule per kilogram.

$$
1 \mathrm{~Gy}=1 \mathrm{Jkg}
$$

An old unit is rad, an acronym for radiation absorbed dose.

$$
1 \mathrm{rad}=0.01 \mathrm{~Gy}
$$

Equal doses of different radiations do not produce same biological effect. For the same absorbed dose, $\alpha$-particles are 20 times more damaging than X-rays. The effect also depends on the part of the body absorbing the radiation. For example, neutrons are particularly more damaging to eyes than other parts of the body. To allow this, the absorbed dose is multiplied by a quality factor known as relative biological effectiveness or RBE (Table 21.2). The equivalent dose $D_{e}$ of any absorbed radiation is defined as the product of absorbed dose and RBE of the kind of radiation being absorbed.

$$
D_{e}=D \times \mathrm{RBE}
$$

The SI unit of equivalent dose is sievert (Sv).

$$
1 \mathrm{~Sv}=1 \mathrm{~Gy} \times \mathrm{RBE}
$$

An old unit, the rem is equal to 0.01 Sv .

$$
1 \mathrm{rem}=0.01 \mathrm{~Sv}
$$

The background radiation to which we are exposed, on the average, is 2 mSv per year. Doses of 3 Sv will cause radiation burns to the skin. For workers in the nuclear facilities or mines, a weekly dose of 1 mSv is normally considered safe (Table 21.3).

The damage from $\alpha$-particles is small unless the source enters the body. $\alpha$ and $\beta$-particles can cause redness and sores on the skin. Some other low level radiation effects are loss of hair, ulceration, stiffening of the lungs, and a drop in the white blood cells which is followed by a sickness pattern of diarrhea, vomiting and fever known as radiation sickness (Fig. 21.16). High levels of radiation may disrupt the blood cells seriously leading to diseases such as anaemia and leukaemia. Chromosome abnormalities or mutation may cause delayed genetic effects such as cancer, eye cataracts and abnormalities in the future generations. These may develop many years after exposure to harmful radiation.
Example 21.3: How much energy is absorbed by a man of mass 80 kg who receives a lethal whole body equivalent dose of 400 rem in the form of low energy neutrons for which RBE factor is 10 ?

| Table 21.3 |  |
| :--: | :--: |
| Averagc radation doses from a number of common sources of ionizing radation |  |
| Types of Exposure | mSv |
| Watching television for a year | 10 |
| Radiation from nuclear power stations for a year | 10 |
| Wearing a radioactive luminous watch for a year (now not very common) | 30 |
| Having a chest X-ray | 200 |
| Radiation from a brick house per year | 750 |
| Maximum dose allowed to general public from artificial sources per year | 1000 |
| Working for a month of a uranium mine | 1000 |
| Typical dose received by a member of the general public in a year from all sources | 2500 |
| Maximum dose allowed to workers exposed to radiation per year | 50000 |

Film badge dosimeter are used to monitor radiation received by workers in nuclear facilities.

## Radioactive wastes are of three types i.e., high level, medium and low level. All these wastes are dangerous for ground water and land environment.

## It is very difficult to dispose off radioactive waste safely due to their long half lives e.g., 'Pu' half life is 24,000 years, therefore, it remains dangerous for about 1.92 .000 years.

## Solution:

RBE factor $=10$

$$
D_{s}=400 \mathrm{rem}=400 \times 0.01 \mathrm{~Sv}=4 \mathrm{~Sv} \quad ; \quad D=7
$$

Using Eq. 21.4

$$
D=\frac{D_{s}}{\mathrm{RBE}}=\frac{4 \mathrm{~Sv}}{10}=0.4 \mathrm{~Gy}
$$

Since 1 Gy is $1 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~kg}^{-1}$, hence total energy absorbed by the whole body $=m D=80 \times 0.4 \mathrm{~Gy}=32 \mathrm{~J}$

It is a very small amount of thermal energy. Obviously, the damage done by ionizing radiation has nothing to do with thermal energy. The harmful effects arise due to disruption of the normal functions of the tissues in which it is absorbed.

## 21.13 BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL USES OF RADIATION

Radioisotopes of many elements can be made easily by bombardment with neutrons and other particles. As such isotopes have become available and are inexpensive, their use in medicine, agriculture, scientific research and industries has expanded tremendously.
Radioisotopes are used to find out what happens in many complex chemical reactions and how they proceed. Similarly in biology, they have helped in investigating into chemical reactions that take place in plants and animals. By mixing a small amount of radioactive isotope with fertilizer, we can easily measure how much fertilizer is taken up by a plant using radiation detector. From such measurements, farmers know the proper amount of fertilizer to use. Through the use of radiation-induced mutations, improved varieties of certain crops such as rice, chickpea, wheat and cotton have been developed. They have improved plant structure. The plants have shown more resistance to diseases and pest, and give better yield and grain quality. Radiation is also used to treat cancers. Radioactive tracers and imaging devices have helped in the understanding and diagnosis of many diseases.

## Tracer Techniques

A radioactive isotope behaves in just the same way as the normal isotope inside a living organism. But the location and concentration of a radioactive isotope can be determined easily by measuring the radiation it emits. Thus, a radioactive

isotope acts as an indicator or tracer that makes it possible to follow the course of a chemical or biological process. The technique is to substitute radioactive atoms for stable atoms of the same kind in a substance and then to follow the 'tagged' atoms with the help of radiation detector in the process. Tracers are widely used in medicine to detect malignant tumors and in agriculture to study the uptake of a fertilizer by a plant. For example, if a plant is given radioactive carbon-14, it will use it in exactly the same way as it always uses stable carbon-12. But the carbon-14 releases $\beta$-radiations and thus by measuring radioactivity in different parts of the plant, the path taken by the carbon atoms can be known. This technique has helped to understand more elaborately the complex process of photosynthesis. The tracer technique was also used to identify faults in the underground pipes of the fountain system of the historical Shalimar gardens of Lahore by the scientists of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.

## Medical Diagnostics and Therapy

Tracers are widely used in medicine to study the process of digestion and the way chemical substances move about in the body.

Some chemicals such as hydrogen and sodium present in water and food are distributed uniformly throughout the body. Certain other chemicals are selectively absorbed by certain organs. Radio-iodine, for example, is absorbed mostly by the thyroid gland, phosphorus by bones and cobalt by liver. They can serve as tracers. Small quantity of low activity radioisotope mixed with stable isotope is administered by injection or otherwise to a patient and its location in diseased tissue can be ascertained by means of radiation detectors. For example, radioactive iodine can be used to check that a person's thyroid gland is working properly. A diseased or hyperactive gland absorbs more than twice the amount of normal thyroid gland. A similar method can be used to study the circulation of blood using radioactive isotope sodium-24.
Experiments on cancerous cells have shown that those cells that multiply rapidly absorb more radiation and are more easily destroyed than normal cells by ionizing radiation. Radiotherapy with $\gamma$-rays from cobalt-60 is often used in the treatment of cancer. The $\gamma$-rays are carefully focussed on to the malignant tissue. Strict safety precautions are necessary

for both patient and attendant medical staff. Radioactive iodine-131 is used to combat cancer of the thyroid gland. Since iodine tends to collect in the thyroid gland, radioactive isotopes lodge where they can destroy the malignant cells. In some cases encapsulated "seeds" are implanted in the malignant tissue for local and short ranged treatment. For skin cancers, phosphorus- 32 or strontium- 90 may be used instead. These produce $\beta$-radiation. The dose of radiation has to be carefully controlled otherwise the radiation could do more damage than help. Patients undergoing radiation treatment often feel ill, because the radiation also damages the healthy cells.

## Radiography

The $\gamma$-rays radiographs are used in medical diagnosis such as internal imaging of the brain to determine precisely the size and location of a tumor or other parts of the body. Cracks or cavities in castings or pipes can also be detected by scanning. Any sudden increase in count rate indicates a cavity within the object.

The gamma camera is designed to detect $\gamma$-radiations from sites in the body where a $\gamma$-emitting isotope is located. An image as shown in Fig. 21.17, consisting of many dots of the $\gamma$-emitting sources in the patient body is formed. The camera can also be used to obtain a sequence of images to observe an organ such as a kidney in action.
