### 21.14 BASIC FORCES OF NATURE

The man has always desired to comprehend the complexity of nature in terms of as few elementary concepts as possible. Among his quest, in Feynman's words, has been the one for "wheels within wheels", the task of Natural Philosophy being to discover the inner most wheels if any such exist. A second quest has concentrated itself with the fundamental forces, which make the wheels go round and enmesh with one another.
Although we have been familiar with the basic forces and about some of the basic building blocks of the matter, but here we are going to study the modern concepts about both of these. We know that the basic forces are:

1. Gravitational force
2. Magnetic force
3. Electric force
4. Weak nuclear force
5. Strong nuclear force

The electric and magnetic forces were unified to get an electromagnetic force by Faraday and Maxwell, who were able to prove that a current is induced in a coil whenever the magnetic flux passing through the coil is changed; leaving behind four fundamental forces, the strong nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force and the gravitational force. These four fundamental forces of nature have seemed for some time quite different from one another. Despite its different effective strength, the strong nuclear force is effective only withir sub-nuclear distances and therefore, confines the neutrons and protons within the nucleus. The electromagnetic force is long-range and causes all chemical reactions. It binds together atoms, molecules, crystals, trees, buildings and you. This force acting on a microscopic level is responsible for a variety of apparently different macroscopic forces such as friction, cohesion and adhesion. The weak nuclear force is short range, like the strong nuclear force, and is responsible for spontaneous breaking up of the radioactive elements. It is a sort of repulsive force of very short range $\left(10^{-17} \mathrm{~m}\right)$. It is usually masked by the effect of the strong and electromagnetic forces inside the nuclei. The gravitational force, like the electromagnetic force, is again long range, extending upto and beyond the remotest stars and galaxies. It keeps you, the atmosphere and the seas fixed to the surface of the planet. It gives rise to the ocean tides and keeps the planets moving in their orbits around the Sun.
These widely disparate properties of the four basic forces have not stopped the scientists from finding a common cause for them all.
One hundred years after the unification of electric and magnetic forces into electromagnetic force, in 1979, the physics nobel prize was conferred on Glashow, Weinberg and Abdus Slam for the unification of electromagnetic and weak forces.

It is further expected that a strong nuclear force will eventually unite with electroweak force to make up a single entity resulting in the grand unified electro-nuclear force.
