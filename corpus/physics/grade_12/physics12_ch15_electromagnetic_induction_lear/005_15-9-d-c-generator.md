### 15.9 D.C. GENERATOR

Alternating current generators are not suitable for many applications, for example, to run a D.C. Motor. In 1834, William Sturgeon invented a simple device called a commutator that prevents the direction of current from

changing. Therefore a D.C. generator is similar to the A.C. generator in construction with the difference that "slip rings" are replaced by "split rings". The "split rings" are two halves of a ring that act as a commutator. Fig. 15.17 shows the "split rings" A and $A^{\prime}$ attached to the two ends of the coil that rotates in the magnetic field. When the current in the coil is zero and is about to change direction, the split rings also change the contacts with the carbon brushes $B B^{\prime}$. In this way the output from $B B^{\prime}$ remains in the same direction, although the current is not constant in magnitude. The curve of the current is shown in Fig. 15.18. It is similar to a sine curve with the lower half inverted. The fluctuations of the output can be significantly reduced by using many coils rather than a single one. Multiple coils are wound around a cylindrical core to form the armature. Each coil is connected to a separate commutator and the output of every coil is tapped only as it reaches its peak emf. Thus the emf in the outer circuit is almost constant.
