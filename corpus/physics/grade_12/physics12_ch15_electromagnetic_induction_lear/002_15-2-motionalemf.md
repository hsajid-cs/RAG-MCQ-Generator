### 15.2 MOTIONALEMF

In the previous section we have studied that when a conductor is moved across a magnetic field, an emf is induced between its ends. The emf of the moving conductor is similar to that of a battery, i.e., if the ends of the conductor are joined by a wire to make a closed circuit, a current flows through it.

The emf induced by the motion of a conductor across a magnetic field is called motional emf.

Consider a conducting rod of length $L$ placed on two parallel metal rails separated by a distance $L$. A galvanometer is connected between the ends $c$ and $d$ of the rails. This forms a complete conducting loop abcda (Fig. 15.7a). A uniform

magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ is applied directed into the page. Initially when the rod is stationary, galvanometer indicates no current in the loop. If the rod is pulled to the right with constant velocity $v$, the galvanometer indicates a current flowing through the loop. Obviously, the current is induced due to the motion of the conducting rod across the magnetic field. The moving rod is acting as a source of emf $\varepsilon=V_{b}-V_{a}=\Delta V$.
When the rod moves, a charge $q$ within the rod also moves with the same velocity $v$ in the magnetic field $B$ and experiences a force given by

$$
F=q v \times B
$$

The magnitude of the force is

$$
F=q \vee B \sin \theta
$$

Since angle $\theta$ between $v$ and $B$ is $90^{\circ}$, so

$$
F=q v B
$$

Applying the right hand rule, we see that $F$ is directed from a to $b$ in the rod. As a result the charge migrates to the top end of the conductor. As more and more of the charges migrate, concentration of the charge is produced at the top $b$ and deficiency of charges at the bottom a. This redistribution of charge sets up an electrostatic field $E$ directed from $b$ to $a$. The electrostatic force on the charge is $F_{e}=q E$ directed from b to a. The system quickly reaches an equilibrium state in which these two forces on the charge are balanced. If $E_{0}$ is the electric intensity in this state then

$$
\begin{aligned}
q E_{0} & =q v B \\
E_{0} & =v B
\end{aligned}
$$

The motional emf $\varepsilon$ will be equal to the potential difference $\Delta V, \Delta V=V_{b}-V_{a}$ between the two ends of the moving conductor in this equilibrium state. The gradient of potential will be given by $\Delta V / L$. As the electric intensity is given by the negative of the gradient, therefore,

$$
E_{0}=-\frac{\Delta V}{L}
$$

$$
\text { or } \Delta V=-L E_{0}=-(L v B)
$$

This heater operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction. The water in the metal pot is boiling whereas that in the glass pot is not. Even the glass top of the heater is cool to touch. The coil just beneath the top carries ac that produces changing magnetic flux. Flux linking with pots induce emf in them. Current is generated in the metal pot that heats up the water, but no current flows through the glass pan, why?

The motional emf

$$
\varepsilon=\Delta V=-L V B
$$

This is the magnitude of motional emf. However, if the angle between $v$ and $B$ is $\theta$, then

$$
\varepsilon=-v B L \sin \theta
$$

Due to induced emf positive charges would flow along the path abcda, therefore the induced current is anticlockwise in the diagram. As the current flows the quantity of the charge at the top decreases so the electric intensity decreases but the magnetic force remains the same Hence the equilibrium is disturbed in favour of magnetic force. Thus as the charges. reach the end a of the conductor due to current flow, they are carried to the top end $b$ of the conductor by the unbalanced magnetic field and the current continues to flow.

Example 15.1: A metal rod of length 25 cm is moving at a speed of $0.5 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ in a direction perpendicular to a 0.25 T magnetic field. Find the emf produced in the rod.

## Solution:

Speed of rod $=V=0.5 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$
Length of rod $=L=25 \mathrm{~cm}=0.25 \mathrm{~m}$
Magnetic flux density $=B=0.25 \mathrm{~T}=0.25 \mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$
Induced emf $=\varepsilon=$ ?
Using the relation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon=\text { VBL } \\
& \varepsilon=0.5 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \times 0.25 \mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1} \times 0.25 \mathrm{~m} \\
& \varepsilon=3.13 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{JC}^{-1} 3.13 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$
