### 15.4 LENZ'S LAW AND DIRECTION OF INDUCED EMF

In the previous section, a mathematical expression of the Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction was derived as

$$
\varepsilon=-\mathrm{N} \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}
$$

The minus sign in the expression is very important. It has to do with the direction of the induced emf. To determine the direction we use a method based on the discovery made by the Russian Physicist Heinrich Lenz in 1834. He found that the polarity of an induced emf always leads to an induced current that opposes, through the magnetic field of the induced current, the change inducing the emf. The rule is known as Lenz's law which states that
"The direction of the induced current is always so as to oppose the change which causes the current".

The Lenz's law refers to induced currents and not to induced emf, which means that we can apply it directly to closed conducting loops or coils. However, if the loop is not closed we can imagine as if it were closed, and then from the direction of induced current, we can find the direction of the induced emf.

Let us apply the Lenz's law to the coil in which current is induced by the movement of a bar magnet. We know that a current carrying coil produces a magnetic field similar to that of a bar magnet. One face of the coil acts as the north pole while the other one as the south pole. If the coil is to oppose the motion of the bar magnet, the face of the coil towards the magnet must become a north pole (Fig. 15.9). The two north poles will then repel each other. The right hand rule applied to
the coil suggests that the induced current must be anticlockwise as seen from the side of the bar magnet.

According to Lenz's law the "push' of the magnet is the "change" that produces the induced current, and the current acts to oppose the push. On the other hand if we pull the magnet away from the coil the induced current will oppose the "pull" by creating a south pole on the face of coil towards the bar magnet.

The Lenz's law is also a statement of law of conservation of energy that can be conveniently applied to the circuits involving induced currents. To understand this, consider once again the experiment in Fig. 15.8. When the rod moves towards right, emf is induced in it and an induced current flows through the loop in the anti-clockwise direction. Since the

Fig. 15.10
current carrying rod is moving in the magnetic field, it experiences a magnetic force $F_{\text {m }}$ having the magnitude $F_{m}=I L B \sin 90^{\circ}$. By right hand rule the direction of $F_{m}$ is opposite to that of $v$, so it tends to stop the rod (Fig. 15.10 a). An external dragging force equal to $F_{m}$ in magnitude but opposite in direction must be applied to keep the rod moving with constant velocity. This dragging force provides the energy for the induced current to flow. This energy is the source of induced current, thus electromagnetic induction is exactly according to law of conservation of energy.
The Lenz's law forbids the induced current directed clockwise in this case, because the force $F_{\text {. }}$ would be, then, in the direction of $v$ that would accelerate the rod towards right (Fig. 15.10 b). This in turn would induce a stronnci current, the magnetic field due to it also increases, (1) the magnetic force increases further. Thus the motion of the wire is accelerated more and more. Starting with a minute quantity of energy, we obtain an ever increasing kinetic energy of motion apparently from nowhere. Consequently the process becomes self-perpetuating which is against the law of conservation of energy.

# 15.5 MUTUAL INDUCTION

Consider two coils placed close to each other (Fig.15.11). One coil connected with a battery through a switch and a
Fig. 15.11
rheostat is called the "primary" and the other one connected to the galvanometer is called the "secondary". If the current in the primary is changed by varying the resistance of the rheostat, the magnetic flux in the surrounding region

changes. Since the secondary coil is in the magnetic field of the primary, the changing flux also links with the secondary. This causes an induced emf in the secondary.

The phenomenon in which a changing current in one coil induces an emf in another coil is called the mutual induction.

According to Faraday's law, the emf induced in the secondary coil is proportional to the rate of change of flux $\frac{\Delta \Phi_{s}}{\Delta t}$ passing through it, i.e., $\quad \varepsilon_{s}=-N_{s} \frac{\Delta \Phi_{s}}{\Delta t}$
where $N_{s}$ is the number of turns in the secondary coil.
Let the flux passing through one loop of the secondary coil be $\Phi_{s}$. Net flux passing through the coil of $\mathrm{N}_{s}$ loops is $\mathrm{N}_{s} \Phi_{s}$. As this flux is proportional to the magnetic field produced by the current $I_{p}$ in the primary and the magnetic field itself is proportional to $I_{p}$, therefore

$$
\begin{aligned}
& N_{s} \Phi_{s} \propto I_{p} \\
& N_{s} \Phi_{s}=M I_{p}
\end{aligned}
$$

Where $M=\frac{N_{s} \Phi_{s}}{I_{p}}$ is proportionality constant called the
mutual inductance of the two coils. It depends upon the number of turns of the coils, their area of cross-section, their closeness together and the nature of the core material upon which the two coils are wound.
By Faraday's law the emf induced in the secondary coil is given by the rate of change of flux through the secondary.

$$
\varepsilon_{s}=-N_{s} \frac{\Delta \Phi_{s}}{\Delta t}=-\frac{\Delta N \Phi_{s}}{\Delta t}
$$

Putting $\mathrm{N}_{s} \Phi_{s}=\mathrm{M} I_{p}$ from Eq. 15.9

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon_{s}=-\frac{\Delta\left(M I_{p}\right)}{\Delta t} \\
& \varepsilon_{s}=-M \frac{\Delta I_{p}}{\Delta t}
\end{aligned}
$$

The Eq.15.10 shows that the emf induced in the secondary is proportional to the time rate of change of current in the primary.

The negative sign in Eq. 15.10 indicates the fact that the induced emf is in such a direction that it opposes the change of current in the primary coil. While finding out the value of $M$ from Eq.15.10, negative sign is ignored. Thus $M$ may be defined as the ratio of average emf induced in the secondary to the time rate of change of current in the primary.

$$
M=\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{s}}}{\Delta t_{\mathrm{p}} / \Delta t}
$$

The SI unit for the mutual inductance $M$ is Vs $\mathrm{A}^{-1}$, which is called as henry $(\mathrm{H})$ after Joseph Henry.
One henry is the mutual inductance of the pair of coils in which the rate of change of current of one ampere per second in the primary causes an induced emf of one volt in the secondary.

Example 15.3: An emf of 5.6 V is induced in a coil while the current in a nearby coil is decreased from 100 A to 20 A in 0.02 s . What is the mutual inductance of the two coils? If the secondary has 200 turns, find the change in flux during this interval.

# Solution:

emf induced in the secondary $=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{s}}=5.6 \mathrm{~V}$
Change in current in primary $=\Delta t_{p}=100 \mathrm{~A}-20 \mathrm{~A}=80 \mathrm{~A}$
Time interval for the change $=\Delta t=0.02 \mathrm{~s}$
Mutual inductance $=\mathrm{M}=$ ?
No. of turns in the secondary $=\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{s}}=200$
Change in flux

$$
=\Delta \Phi=\text { ? }
$$

Using

$$
\begin{aligned}
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{s}} & =\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t} \mathrm{M} \\
5.6 \mathrm{~V} & =\mathrm{M} \times \frac{80 \mathrm{~A}}{0.02 \mathrm{~s}} \\
\mathrm{M}=\frac{5.6 \mathrm{~V} \times 0.02 \mathrm{~s}}{80 \mathrm{~A}} & =1.4 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{VsA}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

By Faraday's Law $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{s}}=\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{s}} \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}$

$$
\Delta \Phi_{\mathrm{s}}=\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{s}} \Delta \mathrm{t}}{\mathrm{~N}_{\mathrm{s}}}=\frac{5.6 \mathrm{~V} \times 0.02 \mathrm{~s}}{200}=5.6 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~Wb}
$$

# 15.6 SELF INDUCTION

According to Faraday's law, the change of flux through a coil by any means induces an emf in it. In all the examples we have discussed so far, induced emf was produced by a changing magnetic flux from some external source. But the change of flux through a coil may also be due to a change of current in the coil itself.
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 15.12. A coil is connected in series with a battery and a rheostat. Magnetic flux is produced through the coil due to current in it. If the current is changed by varying the rheostat quickly, magnetic flux through the coil changes that causes an induced emf in the coil. Such an emf is called as self induced emf.
Fig. 15.12

## The phenomenon in which a changing current in a coil induces an emf in itself is called self induction.

If the flux through one loop of the coil be $\Phi$, then the total flux through the coil of $N$ turns would be $N \Phi$. As $\Phi$ is proportional to the magnetic field which is in turn proportional to the current $I$, therefore

$$
N \Phi \propto I
$$

or

$$
N \Phi=L I
$$

where $L=\frac{N \Phi}{I}$ is the constant of proportionality called the self inductance of the coil. It depends upon the number of turns of the coil, its area of cross-section and the core material. By winding the coil around a ferromagnetic (iron) core, the magnetic flux and hence the inductance can be increased significantly relative to that for an air core.
By Faraday's Law, emf induced in the coil is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}=-\mathrm{N} \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} \\
& \varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}=-\frac{\Delta(N \Phi)}{\Delta t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting $N \Phi=L I$ from Eq.15.11

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}=-\frac{\Delta(L I)}{\Delta t} \\
& \varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}=-L \frac{\Delta I}{\Delta t}
\end{aligned}
$$

The Eq. 15.12 shows that the self induced emf in a coil is proportional to the time rate of change of current in the coil. Self inductance $L$ of a coil may be defined as the ratio of the emf to the rate of change of current in the coil. The unit of $L$ is also henry $(\mathrm{H})$.

The negative sign in Eq. 15.12 indicates that the self induced emf must oppose the change that produced it. That is why the self induced emf is sometimes called as back emf. This is exactly in accord with the Lenz's law. If the current is increased, the induced emf will be opposite to that of battery and if the current is decreased the induced emf will aid, rather than opposing the battery. Because of their self inductance, coils of wire are known as inductors, and are widely used in electronics. In alternating current, inductors behave like resistors.
Example 15.4: The current in a coil of 1000 turns is changed from 5 A to zero in 0.2 s . If an average emf of 50 V is induced during this interval, what is the self inductance of the coil? What is the flux through each turn of the coil when a current of 6 A is flowing?

# Solution:

| Change in current | $=\Delta I=5 \mathrm{~A}-0=5 \mathrm{~A}$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| Time interval | $=\Delta t=0.2 \mathrm{~s}$ |
| emf induced | $=\varepsilon=50 \mathrm{~V}$ |
| Self induction | $=L=?$ |
| Steady current | $=I=6 \mathrm{~A}$ |
| No. of turns of coil | $=N=1000$ |
| Flux through each turn $=$ |  |

Using

$$
\begin{gathered}
L=\frac{\varepsilon}{\Delta I / \Delta t}=\frac{50 \mathrm{~V}}{5 \mathrm{~A} / 0.2 \mathrm{~s}}=\frac{50 \mathrm{~V}}{5 \mathrm{~A} / 0.2 \mathrm{~s}} \\
L=2 \mathrm{VsA}^{-1}=2 \mathrm{H}
\end{gathered}
$$

Now, using Eq. 15.11

$$
\begin{gathered}
N \Phi=L I \text { or } \Phi=\frac{L I}{N} \\
\Phi=\frac{2 \mathrm{H} \times 6 \mathrm{~A}}{1000}=1.2 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~Wb}
\end{gathered}
$$

# 15.7 ENERGY STORED IN AN INDUCTOR

We have studied in chapter 12 that energy can be stored in the electric field between the plates of a capacitor. In a similar manner, energy can be stored in the magnetic field of an inductor.
Consider a coil connected to a battery and a switch in series (Fig. 15.13). When the switch is turned on voltage $V$ is applied across tho ends of the coil and current through it rises from zero to its maximum value $I$. Due to change of current, an emf is induced, which is opposite to that of battery. Work is done by the battery to move charges against the induced emf.
Work done by the battery in moving a small charge $\Delta q$ is

$$
W=\Delta q \varepsilon_{L}
$$

Where $\varepsilon_{L}=$ is the magnitude of induced emf, given by

$$
\varepsilon_{L}=L \frac{\Delta I}{\Delta I}
$$

Putting the value of $\varepsilon_{L}=$ in Eq. 15.13 we get

$$
W=\Delta q \cdot L \frac{\Delta I}{\Delta I}=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta I} \cdot L \Delta I
$$

Total work done in establishing the current from 0 to $I$ is found by inserting for $\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta I}$, the average current, and the value of $\Delta I$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Average current }=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta I}=\left(\frac{0+1}{2}\right) I=\frac{1}{2} I \\
& \text { Change in current }=\Delta I=I-0=I \\
& \text { Total work } \quad=W=\left(\frac{1}{2} I\right) L I \\
& W=\frac{1}{2} L I^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

This work is stored as potential energy in the inductor. Hence the energy stored in an inductor is

$$
U_{m}=\frac{1}{2} L I^{2}
$$

As in case of a capacitor, energy is stored in the electric field between the plates, likewise, in an inductor, energy is stored in the magnetic field. Therefore, Eq. 15.15 can be expressed in terms of the magnetic field $B$ of a solenoid which has $n$ turns per unit length and area of cross section A. The magnetic field strength inside it is $B=\mu_{r} n /$. Since flux through the coil is
Fig. 15.13

For Your Information
An induction ammeter with its ironcore jaw (a) open and (b) closed around a wire carrying an alternating current $I$, some of the magnetic field lines that encircle the wire are routed through the coil by the iron core and lead to an induced emf. The meter detects the emf and is calibrated to display the amount of current in the wire.

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Phi=B A \\
\text { or } \\
\Phi=\mu_{0} n / A
\end{gathered}
$$

Substituting the value of $\Phi$ in Eq. 15.11

$$
N \Phi=L / \quad \text { or } \quad L=\frac{N \Phi}{l}
$$

we have

$$
L=N \frac{\mu_{0} n / A}{l}=N \mu_{0} n A
$$

If $\ell$ is the length of solenoid, then putting $N=n \ell$ in above Eq. we get the self inductance of the solenoid as

$$
\begin{aligned}
& L=(n \ell) \mu_{0} n A \\
& L=\mu_{0} n^{2} A \ell
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting for $L$, the Eq. 15.15 becomes,

$$
U_{m}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mu_{0} n^{2} A \ell\right) l^{2}
$$

Since $B$ for a solenoid is given by $B=\mu_{0} n /$ or $I=\frac{B}{\mu_{0} n}$
Substituting for $I$, Eq. 15.18 becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
& U_{m}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mu_{0} n^{2} A \ell\right)\left(\frac{B}{\mu_{0} n}\right)^{2} \\
& U_{m}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{B^{2}}{\mu_{0}}(A \ell)
\end{aligned}
$$

Now energy density can be defined as the energy stored per unit volume inside the solenoid, so dividing Eq. 15.19 by the volume ( $A \ell$ )-we get energy density,

$$
u_{m}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{B^{2}}{\mu_{0}}
$$

Example 15.5: A solenoid coil 10.0 cm long has 40 turns per cm . When the switch is closed, the current rises from zero to its maximum value of 5.0 A in 0.01 s . Find the energy stored in the magnetic field if the area of cross-section of the solenoid be $28 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.

## Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Length of solenoid }=\ell=10.0 \mathrm{~cm}=0.1 \mathrm{~m} \\
& \text { No. of turns } \quad=n=40 \text { per } \mathrm{cm}=4000 \text { per } \mathrm{m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Area of cross section $=A=28 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}=2.8 \times 10^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$
Steady current $=I=5 \mathrm{~A}$
Energy Stored $=U_{m}=$ ?
First, we calculate the inductance $L$ using the Eq. (15.17)

$$
\begin{gathered}
L=\mu_{0} n^{2} A \ell \\
=\left(4 \pi \times 10^{-7}\right) \mathrm{WbA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1} \times\left(4000 \mathrm{~m}^{-1}\right)^{2} \times 2.8 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \times 0.1 \mathrm{~m} \\
=5.63 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{WbA}^{-1}=5.63 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{H}
\end{gathered}
$$

Energy stored $=U_{m}=\frac{1}{2} L I^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(5.63 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{NmA}^{-2}\right) \times(5 \mathrm{~A})^{2}$

$$
=7.04 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{Nm}=7.04 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~J}
$$

# 15.8 ALTERNATING CURRENT GENERATOR

We have learnt that when a current carrying coil is placed in a magnetic field, a torque acts on it that rotates the coil. What happens if a coil of wire is rotated in a magnetic field? Can a current be produced in the coil? Yes, it does. Such a device is called a current generator.

## A current generator is a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

The principle of an electric generator is based on Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. When a coil is rotated in a magnetic field by some mechanical means, magnetic flux through the coil changes, and consequently an emf is induced in the coil.
If the generator is connected to an external circuit, an electric current is the output of the generator.
Let a rectangular loop of wire of area $A$ be placed in a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ (Fig.15.14). The loop is rotated about z-axis through its centre at constant angular velocity $\omega$. One end of the loop is attached to a metal ring $R$ and the other end to the ring $R^{\prime}$. These rings, called the slip rings are concentric with the axis of the loop and rotate with it. Rings $R R^{\prime}$ slide against stationary carbon brushes to which external circuit is connected.
To calculate the induced emf in the loop, consider its position (Fig.15.15) while it is rotating anticlockwise. The figure shows the top view of the coil. The vertical side ab of the loop is moving with velocity $\mathbf{v}$ in the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$. If the angle between $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be $\theta$, the motional emf induced in the side ab has the magnitude,

$$
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ab}}=v B L \sin \theta
$$

(Front view)
Fig. 15.14
Fig. 15.15

The direction of induced current in the wire ab is the same as that of force $F$ experienced by the charges in the wire, i.e., from top to the bottom. The same amount of emf is induced in the side cd but the direction of current is from bottom to the top.
Therefore

$$
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ct}}=v B L \sin \theta
$$

The net contribution to emf by sides bc and da is zero because the force acting on the charges inside bc and da is not along the wire.

$$
\text { Thus } \quad \varepsilon_{\mathrm{bc}}=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{da}}=0
$$

Since both the emfs in the sides ab and cd drive current in the same direction around the loop, the total emf in the loop is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ab}}+\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cd}} \\
& \varepsilon=v B L \sin \theta+v B L \sin \theta \\
& \varepsilon=2 v B L \sin \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

If the loop is replaced by a coil of N turns, the total emf in the coil will be,

$$
\varepsilon=2 N v B L \sin \theta
$$

The linear speed $v$ of the vertical wire is related to the angular speed $\omega$ by the relation

$$
v=\omega r
$$

where $r$ is the distance of the vertical wires from the centre of the coil. Substituting $\omega r$ for $v$ in Eq. (15.21)

We get

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon=2 \mathrm{~N}(\omega r) B L \sin \theta \\
& \varepsilon=N \omega(2 r L) B \sin \theta \\
& \varepsilon=N \omega A B \sin \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

where $A=2 r L=$ area of the coil
As the angular displacement $\theta=\omega t$, so the Eq. 15.22 becomes

$$
\varepsilon=N \omega A B \sin (\omega t)
$$

Eq. 15.23 shows that the induced emf varies sinusoidally with time.
It has the maximum value $\varepsilon_{n}$ when $\sin (\omega t)$ is equal to 1 . Thus

$$
\varepsilon_{n}=N \omega A B
$$

The Eq. 15.23 can be written as,

$$
\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{0} \sin (\omega t)
$$

If $R$ is the resistance of the coil, then by Ohm's law, induced current in the coil will be

$$
I=\frac{\varepsilon}{R}=\frac{\varepsilon_{0} \sin (\omega t)}{R}=\frac{\varepsilon_{0}}{R} \sin (\omega t)
$$

or

$$
I=I_{0} \sin (\omega t)
$$

where $I_{0}$ is maximum current.
Angular speed $\omega$ of the coil is related to its frequency of rotation $f$ as, $\omega=2 \pi f$

The Eqs. 15.25 and 15.26 can be written as

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon=\varepsilon_{0} \sin (2 \pi f t) \\
& I=I_{0} \sin (2 \pi f t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Eq. 15.28 indicates the variation of current as a function of $\theta=2 \pi f t$. Fig. 15.16 shows the graph for the current corresponding to different positions of one loop of the coil.
When the angle between $\mathbf{v} \& \mathbf{B}$ is $\theta=0^{\circ}$, the plane of the loop is perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$, current is zero. As $\theta$ increases, current also increases and at $\theta=90^{\circ}=\pi / 2 \mathrm{rad}$, the loop is parallel to B, current is maximum, directed along abcda. On further increase in $\theta$ current decreases, and at $\theta=180^{\circ}=\pi$ rad the current becomes zero as the loop is again perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$. For $180^{\circ}<\theta<270^{\circ}$ current increases but reverses its direction as is clear from the figure. Current is now directed along dcbad. At $\theta=270^{\circ}=3 \pi / 2 \mathrm{rad}$, current is maximum in

For Your Information

the reverse direction as the loop is parallel to $\mathbf{B}$. At $\theta=360^{\circ}=2 \pi$ rad, one rotation is completed, the loop is perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$ and the current decreases to zero. After one rotation the cycle repeats itself. The current alternates in direction once in one cycle. Therefore, such a current is called the alternating current. It reverses its direction $f$ times per second.

In actual practice a number of coils are wound around an iron cylinder which is rotated in the magnetic field. This assembly is called an armature. The magnetic field is usually provided by an electromagnet. Armature is rotated by a fuel engine or a turbine run by a waterfall. In some commercial generators, field magnet is rotated around a stationary armature.
Example 15.6: An alternating current generator operating at 50 Hz has a coil of 200 turns. The coil has an area of $120 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. What should be the magnetic field in which the coil rotates in order to produce an emf of maximum value of 240 volts?

## Solution:

Frequency of rotation $=f=50 \mathrm{~Hz}$
No. of turns of the coil $=N=200$
Area of the coil $=A=120 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}=1.2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$
Maximum emf $=\varepsilon_{\text {max }}=240 \mathrm{~V}$
Magnetic flux density $=B=$ ?
First, we shall find the angular speed $\omega$.

Using

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \omega=2 \pi f \\
& \omega=2 \times \frac{22}{7} \times 50=314.3 \mathrm{rads}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using $\varepsilon_{n}=N \omega A B$ or $B=\frac{\varepsilon_{0}}{\mathrm{N} \omega \mathrm{A}}$

$$
B=\frac{240 \mathrm{~V}}{200 \times 314.3 \mathrm{rads}^{-1} \times 1.2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{2}}
$$

$B=0.32 \mathrm{Vs} \mathrm{rad}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{2}=0.32 \mathrm{~T}$
