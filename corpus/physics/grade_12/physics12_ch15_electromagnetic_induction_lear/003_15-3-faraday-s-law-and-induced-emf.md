### 15.3 FARADAY'S LAW AND INDUCED EMF

The motional emf induced in a rod moving perpendicular to a magnetic field is $\varepsilon=-v B L$. The motional emf as well as other induced emfs can be described in terms of magnetic flux. Consider the experiment shown in Fig. 15.8 again. Let the conducting rod $L$ moves from position 1 to position 2 in a small interval of time $\Delta t$. The distance travelled by the rod in time $\Delta t$ is $x_{2}-x_{1}=\Delta x$

Since the rod is moving with constant velocity $v$, therefore

$$
v=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
$$

From Eq. 15.3

$$
\varepsilon=-v B L=-\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} B L
$$

As the rod moves through the distance $\Delta x$, the increase in the area of loop is given by $\Delta A=\Delta x . L$. This increases the flux through the loop by $\Delta \Phi=\Delta A . B=\Delta x . L . B$. Putting $\Delta x . L . B=\Delta \Phi$ in Eq.15.6, we get

$$
\varepsilon=-\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}
$$

If there is a coil of N loops instead of a single loop, then the induced emf will become $N$ times, i.e.,

$$
\varepsilon=-N \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}
$$

Although the above expression is derived on the basis of motional emf, but it is true in general. This conclusion was first arrived at by Faraday, so this is known as Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction which states that
"The average emf induced in a conducting coil of $N$ loops is equal to the negative of the rate at which the magnetic flux through the coil is changing with time".

## A cooper ring passes through a rectangle region where a constant magnetic field is directed into the page. What do you guess about the current in the ring at the positions 2,3 and 4 ?

The minus sign indicates that the direction of the induced emf is such that it opposes the change in flux.
Example 15.2: A loop of wire is placed in a uniform magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. The strength of the magnetic field is 0.6 T . The area of the loop begins to shrink at a constant rate of $\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}=0.8 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. What is the magnitude of emf induced in the loop while it is shrinking?

# Solution:

Rate of change of area $=\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}=0.8 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.
Magnetic flux density $=B=0.6 \mathrm{~T}=0.6 \mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$
Number of turns $=\mathrm{N}=1$
Induced emf $=\varepsilon=$ ?
Rate of change of flux $=\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}=B \frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t} \cos 0^{\circ}=B \frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}$
Applying Faraday's Law, magnitude of induced emf

$$
\begin{aligned}
\varepsilon & =\mathrm{N} \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}=\mathrm{N} B \frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t} \\
& =1 \times 0.6 \mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1} \times 0.8 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\
\varepsilon & =0.48 \mathrm{JC}^{-1}=0.48 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
