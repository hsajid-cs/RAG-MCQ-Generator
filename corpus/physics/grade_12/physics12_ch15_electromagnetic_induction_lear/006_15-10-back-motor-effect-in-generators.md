### 15.10 BACK MOTOR EFFECT IN GENERATORS

A generator is the source of electricity production. Practically, the generators are not so simple as described above. A large turbine is turned by high pressure steam or waterfall. The shaft of the turbine is attached to the coil which rotates in a magnetic field. It converts the mechanical energy of the driven turbine to electrical energy. The generator supplies current to the external circuit. The devices in the circuit that consume electrical energy are known as the "load". The greater the load the larger the current is supplied by the generator. When the circuit is open, the generator does not supply electrical energy, and a very little force is needed to rotate the coil. As soon as the circuit is closed, a current is drawn through the coil. The magnetic field exerts force on the current carrying coil. Fig. 15.19 shows the forces acting on the coil. Force $F_{1}$ is acting on the left side of the coil whereas an equal but opposite force $F_{2}$ acts on the right side of the coil. These forces are such that they produce a counter torque that opposes the rotational motion of the coil. This effect is sometimes referred to as back motor effect in the generators. The larger the current drawn, the greater is the counter torque produced. That means more mechanical energy is required to keep the coil rotating with constant angular speed. This is in agreement with the law of conservation of energy. The

energy consumed by the "load" must come from the "energy source" used to drive the turbine.

# 15.11 D.C. MOTOR

A motor is a device which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. We already know that a wire carrying current placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. This is the basic principle of an electric motor. In construction a D.C motor is similar to a D.C generator, having a magnetic field, a commutator and an armature. In the generator, the armature is rotated in the magnetic field and current is the output. In the D.C motor, current passes through the armature that rotates in the magnetic field. In the D.C motor, the brushes are connected to a D.C supply or battery (Fig.15.20). When current flows through the armature coil, the force on the conductors produces a torque, that rotates the armature. The amount of this torque depends upon the current, the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the coil and the number of turns of the coil.
If the current in the coil were all the time in the same direction, the torque on it would be reversed after each half revolution. But at this moment, commutator reverses the direction of current that keeps the torque always in the same sense. A little problem arises due to the use of commutator, that is, the torque vanishes each time the current changes its direction. This creates jerks in the smooth running of the armature. However the problem is overcome by using more than one coil wrapped around a soft-iron core. This results in producing a more steady torque.
The magnetic field in the motor, is provided by a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. The windings of the electromagnet are usually called the field coils. The field coils may be in series or in parallel to the armature coils.
