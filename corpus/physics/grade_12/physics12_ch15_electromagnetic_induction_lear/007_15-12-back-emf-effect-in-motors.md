### 15.12 BACK EMF EFFECT IN MOTORS

A motor is just like a generator running in reverse. When the coil of the motor rotates across the magnetic field by the applied potential difference $V$, an emf $\varepsilon$ is induced in it. The induced emf is in such a direction that opposes the emf running the motor. Due to this reason the induced emf is called back emf of the motor. The magnitude of the back emf increases with the speed of motor.
Since $V$ and $\varepsilon$ are opposite in polarity, the net emf in the circuit is $V-\varepsilon$. If $R$ is the resistance of the coil and / the current drawn

by the motor, then by Ohm's law

$$
I=\frac{V-\varepsilon}{R} \quad \text { or } \quad V=\varepsilon+I R
$$

When the motor is just started, back emf is almost zero and hence a large current passes through the coil. As the motor speeds up, the back emf increases and the current becomes smaller and smaller. However, the current is sufficient to provide torque on the coil to drive the load and to overcome losses due to friction. If the motor is overloaded, it slows down. Consequently, the back emf decreases and allows the motor to draw more current. If the motor is overloaded beyond its limits, the current could be so high that it may burn out the motor.

Example 15.7: A permanent magnet D.C motor is run by a battery of 24 volts. The coil of the motor has a resistance of 2 ohms. It develops a back emf of 22.5 volts when driving the load at normal speed. What is the current when motor just starts up? Also find the current when motor is running at normal speed.

# Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Operation Voltage } & =V=24 \mathrm{~V} \\
\text { Resistance of the coil } & =R=2 \Omega \\
\text { Backemf } & =\varepsilon=22.5 \mathrm{~V} \\
\text { Current } & =I=\text { ? }
\end{aligned}
$$

i) when motor just starts up, the back emf $\varepsilon=0$

Using

$$
\begin{gathered}
V=\varepsilon+1 R \\
24 \mathrm{~V}=0+1 \times 2 \Omega \\
I=\frac{24 \mathrm{~V}}{2 \Omega}=12 \mathrm{~V} \Omega^{1}=12 \mathrm{~A}
\end{gathered}
$$

when motor runs at normal speed, $\varepsilon=22.5 \mathrm{~V}$
then using

$$
\begin{gathered}
V=\varepsilon+1 R \\
V=22.5 \mathrm{~V}+1 \times 2 \Omega \\
I=\frac{24 \mathrm{~V}-22.5 \mathrm{~V}}{2 \Omega}=0.75 \mathrm{~V} \Omega^{-1}=0.75 \mathrm{~A}
\end{gathered}
$$
