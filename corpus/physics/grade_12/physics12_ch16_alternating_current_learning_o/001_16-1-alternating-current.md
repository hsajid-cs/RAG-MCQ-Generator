### 16.1 ALTERNATING CURRENT

Alternating current (A.C.) is that which is produced by a voltage source whose polarity keeps on reversing with time (Fig.16.1 a,b). In Fig.16.1 (a), the terminal A of the source is positive with respect to terminal $B$ and it remains so during a time interval 0 to $T / 2$. At $t=T / 2$, the terminals change their polarity. Now A becomes negative with respect to B (Fig.16.1 b). This state continues during the time interval $T / 2$ to $T$, after which terminal $A$ again becomes positive with respect to $B$ and the next cycle starts. As a result of this change of polarity, the direction of the current flow in the circuit also changes. During the time $0-T / 2$, it flows in one direction and during the interval $T / 2-T$ in opposite direction (Fig.16.1 a,b). This time interval $T$

during which the voltage source changes its polarity once is known as period $T$ of the alternating current or voltage. Thus the frequency of alternating current or voltage is given as

$$
f=\frac{1}{T}
$$

The most common source of alternating voltage is an A.C. generator which has been described in the previous chapter. The output $V$ of this A.C. generator at any instant is given by

$$
V=V_{0} \sin \left[\frac{2 \pi}{T} \times t\right]
$$

where $T$ is period of the rotation of coil and is equal to the period of A.C. and $\frac{2 \pi}{T}=2 \pi f=\omega$ is angular frequency of rotation of the coil. Thus $\frac{2 \pi}{T} \times t=\omega t$ is the angle through which the coil rotate in time $t$. Eq. 16.2 shows how its value changes with time $t$.
At time $t=0, \theta=\frac{2 \pi}{T} \times t$ is 0 and $V$ is zero. At $t=T / 4$ $\theta=\frac{2 \pi}{T} \times \frac{T}{4}=\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $V$ attains its maximum value $V_{0}$ at that instant. At $t=T / 2, \theta=\pi$ and $V$ is zero. At this instant $V$. changes its polarity and becomes negative. Henceforth, When $t=\frac{3 T}{4}, \theta=\frac{3 \pi}{2}$ and $V=-V_{0}$ and finally at the end of the cycle when $t=T, \theta=2 \pi$ and again $V=0$. The variation of $V$. with time $t$ and $\theta$ is shown in Fig. 16.2 (a,b). This graph between voltage and time is known as waveform of alternating voltage. It can be seen that it is a sine curve. Thus the output voltage of an A.C. generator varies sinusoidally with time. In our daily life we are mostly dealing with this type of voltage, so we will consider it in detail.

## 1. Instantaneous value

The value of voltage or current that exists in a circuit at any instant of time $t$ measured from some reference point is known as its instantaneous value. It can have any value between plus maximum value $+V_{0}$ and negative maximum

value - Vo and is denoted by $V$. The entire waveform shown in Fig. 16.2 is actually a set of all the instantaneous values that exist during a period $T$. Mathematically, it is given by $V=V_{0} \sin \theta=V_{0} \sin \omega t$

$$
V=V_{0} \sin \frac{2 \pi}{T} \times t=V_{0} \sin 2 \pi f t
$$

# 2. Peak value

It is the maximum value reached by the voltage or current in one cycle. For example, voltage shown in Fig. 16.2 has a peak value of $V_{0}$.

## 3. Peak to Peak Value

It is the sum of the positive and negative peak values usually written as p-p.value. The p-p value of the voltage waveform shown in Fig. 16.2 is $2 V_{0}$.

## 4. Post Mean Square (rms) Value

If we connect an ordinary D.C. ammeter to measure alternating current, it would measure its value as averaged over a cycle. It can be seen in Fig. 16.2 that the average value of current and voltage over a cycle is zero, but the power delivered during a cycle is not zero because power is $I^{2} R$ and the values of $I^{2}$ are positive even for negative values of $I$. Thus the average value of $I^{2}$ is not zero and is called the mean square current. The alternating current or voltage is actually measured by square root of its mean square value known as root mean square (rms) value.
Let us compute the average value of $V^{2}$ over a cycle. Fig. 16.3 shows an alternating voltage and the way its $V^{2}$ values vary. Note that the values of $V^{2}$ are positive on the negative half cycle also. As the graph of $V^{2}$ is symmetrical about the line $\frac{1}{2} V_{0}^{2}$, so for this figure the mean or the average value of $V^{2}$ is $\frac{1}{2} V_{0}^{2}$. The root mean square value of $V$ is obtained by taking

the square root of $V_{0}^{2} / 2$ Therefore,

$$
V_{\mathrm{rms}}=\sqrt{\frac{V_{0}^{2}}{2}}=\frac{V_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}=0.7 V_{0}
$$

Similarly

$$
I_{\mathrm{rms}}=\frac{I_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}=0.7 I_{0}
$$

Most of the alternating current and voltage meters are calibrated to read rms values. When we speak of A.C. meter reading, we usually mean rms values unless stated otherwise.

Example 16.1 : An A.C. voltmeter reads 250 V . What is its peak and instantaneous values if the frequency of alternating voltage is 50 Hz ?

# Solution:

rms value of alternating voltage $=V_{\text {rms }}=250 \mathrm{~V}$
Its peak value $V_{0}$ is given by the relation

$$
V_{\mathrm{rms}}=\frac{V_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

or

$$
V_{0}=\sqrt{2} V_{\mathrm{rms}}=\sqrt{2} \times 250 \mathrm{~V}=353.5 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Angular frequency $\omega=2 \pi f$

$$
=2 \times \pi \times 50 \mathrm{~Hz}=100 \pi \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

Therefore, instantaneous value is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
V & =V_{0} \sin \omega t \\
& =353.5 \sin (100 \pi t) \mathrm{V}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Phase of A.C.

We have seen that the instantaneous value of the alternating voltage is given by

$$
V=V_{0} \sin \omega t
$$

or

$$
V=V_{0} \sin \theta
$$

This angle $\theta$ which specifies the instantaneous value of the alternating voltage or current is known as its phase. In Fig. 16.2 (b), we can say that the phase at the points $A, B, C, D$ and $E$ is $0, \pi / 2, \pi, 3 \pi / 2$ and $2 \pi$ respectively because these angles are the values of $\theta$ at these points. Thus each point on the A.C. waveform corresponds to a certain phase.

The phase at the positive peak is $\pi / 2=90^{\circ}$ and it is $3 \pi / 2=270^{\circ}$ at the negative peak. The points where the waveform crosses the time axis correspond to phase 0 and $\pi$.

# Phase Lag and Phase Lead

In practice, the phase difference between two alternating quantities is more important than their absolute phases. Fig. 16.4 shows two waveforms 1 and 2. The phase angles of the waveform 1 at the points $A, B, C, D$ and $E$ have been shown above the axis and those of waveform 2 below the axis. At the point $B$, the phase of 1 is $\pi / 2$ and that of 2 is 0 . Similarly it can be seen that at each point the phase of waveform 2 is less than the phase of waveform 1 by an angle of $\pi / 2$. We say that A.C. 2 is lagging behind A.C. 1 by an angle of $\pi / 2$. It means that at each instant, the phase of A.C. 2 is less than the phase of A.C. 1 by $\pi / 2$. Similarly it can be seen in Fig. 16.5, that the phase at each point of the waveform of A.C. 2 is greater than that of waveform 1 by an angle $\pi / 2$. In this case, it is said that A.C. 2 is leading the A.C. 1 by $\pi / 2$. It means that at each instant of time, the phase of A.C. 2 is greater than that of 1 by $\pi / 2$.
Phase lead and lag between two alternating quantities is conveniently shown by representing the two A.C. quantities as vectors.

## Vector Representation of an Alternating Quantity

A sinusoidally alternating voltage or current can be graphically represented by a counter clockwise rotating vector provided it satisfies the following conditions.

1. Its length on a certain scale represents the peak or rms value of the alternating quantity.
2. It is in the horizontal position at the instant when the alternating quantity is zero and is increasing positively.
3. The angular frequency of the rotating vector is the same as the angular frequency $\omega$ of the alternating quantity.
Fig. 16.6 (a) shows a sinusoidal voltage waveform leading an alternating current waveform by $\pi / 2$. The same fact has been shown vectorially in Fig.16.6 (b). Here vector OI represents the peak or rms value of the current which is taken as the reference quantity. Similarly OV represents the rms or peak value of the alternating voltage which is leading the current by $90^{\circ}$. Both vectors are supposed to be rotating in the counter

# 16.2 A.C. CIRCUITS

The basic circuit element in a D.C. circuit is a resistor (R) which controls the current or voltage and the relationship between them is given by Ohm's law that is $V=I R$.

In A.C. circuits, in addition to resistor $R$, two new circuit elements namely INDUCTOR ( $L$ ), and CAPACITOR (C) become relevant. The current and voltages in A.C. circuits are controlled by three elements $R, L$ and $C$. We would study the response of an A.C. circuit when it is excited by an alternating voltage.
