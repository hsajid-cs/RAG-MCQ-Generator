### 16.10 PARALLELRESONANCE CIRCUIT

Fig. 16.15 shows an $L-C$ parallel circuit. It is excited by an alternating source of voltage whose frequency could be varied. The inductance coil $L$ has a resistance $r$ which is negligibly small. The capacitor draws a leading current.

whereas the coil draws a lagging current. The circuit resonates at a frequency $\omega=\omega_{1}$ which makes $X_{L}=X_{C}$, so that the two branch currents are equal but opposite Hence, they cancel out with the result that the current drawn from the supply is zero. In actual practice, the current is not zero but has a minimum value due to small resistance $r$ of the coil
Properties of parallel resonant circuits are
i) Resonance frequency is $f_{1}=\frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{L C}}$
ii) At the resonance frequency, the circuit impedance is maximum. It is resistive.
iii) At the resonance the current is minimum and it is in phase with the applied voltage. So the power factor is one. The variation of current with the frequency of the source is shown in Fig. 16.16.
iv) At resonance, the branch currents $I_{L}$ and $I_{C}$ may each be larger than the source current $I_{r}$.
Example 16.7: Find the capacitance required to construct a resonance circuit of frequency 1000 kHz with an inductor of 5 mH .

## Solution:

Resonance frequency $\quad=f_{1}=1000 \mathrm{kHz}$

$$
L=5 \mathrm{mH}=5 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{H} \quad, \quad \mathrm{C}=?
$$

Resonance frequency $=f_{1}=\frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{L C}}$
$C=\frac{1}{4 \pi^{2} f_{1}^{2} L}=\frac{1}{4 \times(3.14)^{2} \times\left(10^{5} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2} \times 5 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{H}}=5.09 \mathrm{pF}$
