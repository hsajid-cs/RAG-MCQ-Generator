### 16.14 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

It is a very important class of waves which requires no medium for transmission and which rapidly propagates through vacuum.
In 1864 British physicist James Clark Maxwell formulated a set of equations known as Maxwell's equations which explained the various electromagnetic phenomena. According to these equations, a changing magnetic flux creates an electric field and a changing electric flux creates a magnetic field. Consider a region of space $A B$ as shown in Fig.16.20. Suppose a change of magnetic flux is taking place through it. This changing magnetic flux will set up a changing electric flux in the surrounding region. The creation of electric field in the region $C D$ will cause a change of electric flux through it due to which a magnetic field would be set up in the space surrounding $C D$ and so on. Thus each field generates the other and the whole package of electric and magnetic fields will move along propelling itself through space. Such moving electric and magnetic fields are known as electromagnetic waves. The electric field, magnetic field and the direction of their propagation are mutually orthogonal (Fig.16.21). It can be seen in this figure that the electromagnetic waves are periodic, hence they have a wavelength $\lambda$ which is given by the relation $c=f \lambda$ where $f$ is the frequency and $c$ is the speed of the wave. In free space the speed of electromagnetic waves is $3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$.

Depending upon the values of wavelength and frequency, the electromagnetic waves have been classified into different types of waves as radiowaves, microwaves, infrared rays, visible light etc. Fig. 16.22 shows the complete spectrum of

# 16.15 PRINCIPLE OF GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND RECEPTION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

We have seen that electromagnetic waves are generated when electric or magnetic flux is changing through a certain region of space. An electric charge at rest gives rise to a Coulomb's field which does not radiate in space because no change of flux takes place in this type of field. A charge moving with constant velocity is equivalent to a steady current which generates a constant magnetic field in the

Tit-bits
Shake an electrically charged object to and fro, and you produce electromagnet waves.

When electrons in the transmitting antenna vibrate 94,000 times each second, they produced radio waves having frequency 94 kHz .

surrounding space, but such a field also does not radiate out because no changes of magnetic flux are involved. Thus only chance to generate a wave of moving field is when we accelerate the electrical charges.

A radio transmitting antenna provides a good example of generating electromagnetic waves by acceleration of charges. The piece of wire along which charges are made to accelerate is known as transmitting antenna (Fig.16.23). It is charged by an alternating source of potential of frequency $f$ and time period $T$. As the charging potential alternates, the charge on the antenna also constantly reverses. For example if the top has $+q$ charges at any instant, then after time $T / 2$ the charge on it will be $-q$. Such regular reversal of charges on the antenna gives rise to an electric flux that constantly changes with frequency $f$. This changing electric flux sets up an electromagnetic wave which propagates out in space away from the antenna. The frequency with which the fields alternate is always equal to the frequency of the source generating them. These electromagnetic waves which are propagated out in space from antenna of a transmitter are known as radio waves. In free space these waves travel with the speed of light.
Suppose these waves impinge on a piece of wire (Fig.16.24). The electrons in the wire move under the action of the oscillating electric field which give rise to an alternating voltage across the wire. The frequency of this voltage is the same as that of the wave intercepting the wire. This wire receiving the wave is known as receiving antenna. As the electric field of the wave is very weak at a distance of many kilometres from the transmitter, the voltage that appears across the receiving antenna is very small. Each transmitter propagates radio waves of one particular frequency. So when a number of transmitting stations operate simultaneously, we have a number of radio waves of different frequencies in the space. Thus the voltage that appears across a receiving antenna placed in space is usually due to the radio waves of large number of frequencies. The voltage of one particular frequency can be picked up by connecting an inductance $L$ and a variable capacitor $C$ in parallel with one end of the receiving antenna (Fig.16.24).
If one adjusts the value of the capacitor so that the natural frequency of $L-C$ circuit is the same as that of the transmitting station to be picked up, the circuit will resonate

under the driving action of the antenna. Consequently, the $L-C$ circuit will build up a large response to the action of only that radio wave to which it is tuned. In your radio receiver set when you change stations you actually adjust the value of $C$.

# 16.16 MODULATION

Speech and music etc. are transmitted hundred of kilometres away by a radio transmitter. The scene in front of a television camera is also sent many kilometres away to viewers. In all these uses, the carrier of the programme is a high frequency radio wave. The information i.e., light, sound or other data is impressed on the radio wave and is carried along with it to the destination.

Modulation is the process of combining the low frequency signal with a high frequency radio wave called carrier wave. The resultant wave is called modulated carrier wave. The low frequency signal is known as modulation signal. Modulation is achieved by changing the amplitude or the frequency of the carrier wave in accordance with the modulating signal. Thus we have two types of modulations which are

1. Amplitude modulation (A.M), 2. Frequency modulation (F.M)

## Amplitude Modulation

In this type of modulation the amplitude of the carrier wave is increased or diminished as the amplitude of the superposing modulating signal increases and decreases.
Fig. 16.25 (a) represents a high frequency carrier wave of constant amplitude and frequency. Fig.16.25(b) represents a low or audio frequency signal of a sine waveform. Fig. 16.25 (c) shows the result obtained by modulating thecarrier waves with the modulating wave. The A.M. transmission frequencies range from 540 kHz to 1600 kHz .

## Frequency Modulation

In this type of modulation the frequency of the carrier wave is increased or diminished as the modulating signal amplitude increases or decreases but the carrier wave amplitude remains constant. Fig. 16.26 shows frequency modulation. The frequency of the modulated carrier wave is highest (point H ) when the signal amplitude is at its maximum positive value and is at its lowest frequency (point $L$ ) when signal amplitude has maximum negative. When the signal amplitude is zero, the carrier frequency is at its normal frequency $f_{n}$.
Fig. 16.25
The F.M. transmission frequencies are much higher and ranges between 88 MHz to 108 MHz . F.M. radio waves are affected less by electrical interference than A.M. radio waves and hence, provide a higher quality transmission of sound. However, they have a shorter range than A.M. waves and are less able to travel around obstacles such as hills and large buildings.

# SUMMARY

Alternating current is that which is produced by a voltage source whose polarity keeps on reversing with time.

The time interval during which the voltage source changes its polarity once is known as period $T$ of the alternating current or voltage.

The value of voltage or current that exists in a circuit at any instant of time measured from some reference point is known as its instantaneous value.

The highest value reached by the voltage or current in one cycle is called the peak value of the voltage or current.

The sum of positive and negative peak values is called peak to peak value and is written a $\delta$ p-p value.

The root mean square value (rms) is the square root of the average value of $V^{2}$ or $I^{2}$.
The angle $\theta$ which specifies the instantaneous value of the alternating voltage or current, gives the phase lag or phase lead of one quantity over the other.

An inductor is usually in the form of a coil or a solenoid wound from a thick wire so that it has a large value of self inductance and has negligible resistance.

The combined effect of resistance and reactance in a circuit is known as impedance and is denoted by $Z$.

Choke is a coil which consists of thick copper wire wound closely in a large number of turns over a soft iron laminated core.

Electromagnetic waves are those which require no medium for transmission and rapidly propagate through vacuum.

Modulation is the process of combining the low frequency signal with a high frequency radio wave, called carrier waves. The resultant wave is called modulated carrier wave.
