### 16.6 IMPEDANCE

We already know that resistance $R$ offers opposition to the flow of current. In case of A.C. an inductance $L$ or a capacitance $C$ also offer opposition to the flow of A.C. which is measured by reactances $X_{L}$ and $X_{C}$ respectively. An A.C. circuit may consist of a resistance $R$, an inductance $L$, a capacitance $C$ or a combination of these elements. The combined effect of resistance and reactances in such a circuit is known as impedance and is denoted by $Z$.
It is measured by the ratio of the rms value of the applied voltage to the rms value of resulting A.C. Thus

$$
Z=\frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}}{I_{\mathrm{rms}}}
$$

It is also expressed in ohms.
Example 16.3: When 10 V are applied to an A.C. circuit, the current flowing in it is 100 mA . Find its impedance.

# Solution:

rms value of applied voltage $=V_{\text {mix }}=10 \mathrm{~V}$
rms value of current $=I_{\text {mix }}=100 \mathrm{~mA}=100 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~A}$
Impedance $Z=\frac{V_{\text {mix }}}{I_{\text {mix }}}=\frac{10 \mathrm{~V}}{100 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~A}}=100 \Omega$
