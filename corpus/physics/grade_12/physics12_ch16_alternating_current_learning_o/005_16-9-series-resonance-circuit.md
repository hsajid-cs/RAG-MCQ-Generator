### 16.9 SERIES RESONANCE CIRCUIT

(a)

Consider a $R-L-C$ series circuit which is excited by an alternating voltage source whose frequency could be varied (Fig.16.13 a). The impedance diagram of the circuit is shown in Fig.16.13 (b). As explained earlier, the inductive reactance $X_{\mathrm{L}}=\omega L$ and capacitor reactance $X_{\mathrm{C}}=\frac{1}{\omega \mathrm{C}}$ are directed opposite to each other. When the frequency of A.C. source is very small $X_{\mathrm{C}}=\frac{1}{\omega \mathrm{C}}$ is much greater than $X_{\mathrm{L}}=\omega L$. So the capacitance dominates at low frequencies and the circuit

behaves like an $R-C$ circuit. At high frequencies $X_{L}=\omega L$ is much greater than $X_{C}=\frac{1}{\omega C}$. In this case the inductance dominates and the circuit behaves like $R-L$ circuit. In between these frequencies there will be a frequency $\omega_{r}$ at which $X_{L}=X_{C}$. This condition is called resonance. Thus at resonance the inductive reactance being equal and opposite to capacitor reactance, cancel each other and the impedance diagram assumes the form (Fig.16.13 c). The value of the resonance frequency can be obtained by putting

$$
\omega_{r} L=\frac{1}{\omega_{r} C}
$$

or

$$
\omega_{r}^{2}=\frac{1}{L C} \quad \text { or } \quad \omega_{r}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{L C}}
$$

$$
f_{r}=\frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{L C}}
$$

The following are the properties of the series resonance.
i) The resonance frequency is given by

$$
f_{r}=\frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{L C}}
$$

ii) The impedance of the circuit at resonance is resistive so the current and voltage are in phase. The power factor is 1 .
iii) The impedance of the circuit is minimum at this frequency and it is equal to $R$.
iv) If the amplitude of the source voltage $V_{s}$ is constant, the current is a maximum at the resonance frequency and its value is $V_{s} / R$. The variation of current with the frequency is shown in Fig. 16.14.
v) At resonance $V_{L}$, the voltage drop across inductance and $V_{C}$ the voltage drop across capacitance may be much larger than the source voltage.
