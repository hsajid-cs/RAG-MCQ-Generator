### 16.13 CHOKE

It is a coil which consists of thick copper wire wound closely in a large number of turns over a soft iron laminated cores. This makes the inductance $L$ of the coil quite large whereas its resistance $R$ is very small. Thus it consumes extremely small power. It is used in A.C. circuits to limit current with extremely small wastage of energy as compared to a resistance or a rheostat.
