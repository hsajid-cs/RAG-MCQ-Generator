### 13.3 EFFECTS OF CURRENT

The presence of electric current can be detected by the various effects which it produces. The obvious effects of the current are:
(i) Heating effect
(ii) Magnetic effect
(iii) Chemical effect

# Heating Effect

Current flows through a metallic wire due to motion of free electrons. During the course of their motion, they collide frequently with the atoms of the metal. At each collision, they lose some of their kinetic energy and give it to atoms with which they collide. Thus as the current flows through the wire, it increases the kinetic energy of the vibrations of the metal atoms. i.e., it generates heat in the wire. It is found that the heat $H$ produced by a current $I$ in the wire of resistance $R$ during a time interval $t$ is given by

$$
H=I^{2} R t
$$

The heating effect of current is utilized in electric heaters, kettles, toasters and electric irons etc.

## Magnetic Effect

The passage of current is always accompanied by a magnetic field in the surrounding space. The strength of the field depends upon the value of current and the distance from the current element. The pattern of the field produced by a current carrying straight wire, a coil and a solenoid is shown in Fig. 13.5 (a, b \& c). Magnetic effect is utilized in the detection and measurement of current. All the machines involving electric motors also use the magnetic effect of current.

## Chemical Effect

Certain liquids such as dilute sulphuric acid or copper sulphate solution conduct electricity due to some chemical reactions that take place within them. The study of this process is known as electrolysis. The chemical changes produced during the electrolysis of a liquid are due to chemical effects of the current. It depends upon the nature of the liquid and the quantity of electricity passed through the liquid.
The liquid which conducts current is known as electrolyte. The material in the form of wire or rod or plate which leads the current into or out of the electrolyte is known as electrode. The electrode connected with the positive terminal of the current source is called anode and that connected with negative terminal is known as cathode. The vessel containing the two electrodes and the liquid is known as voltameter. As an example we will consider the electrolysis of copper sulphate solution. The voltameter contains dilute solution of copper sulphate. The anode and cathode are both copper plates
Fig. 13.5

Fig. 13.6
(Fig. 13.6). When copper sulphate is dissolved in water, it dissociates into $\mathrm{Cu}^{++}$and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-}$ions. On passing current through the voltameter. $\mathrm{Cu}^{++}$moves towards the cathode and the following reaction takes place.

$$
\mathrm{Cu}^{++}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}
$$

The copper atoms thus formed are deposited at cathode plate. While copper is being deposited at the cathode, the $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-}$ions move towards the anode. Copper atoms from the anode go into the solution as copper ions which combine with sulphate ions to form copper sulphate.

$$
\mathrm{Cu}^{++}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}
$$

As the electrolysis proceeds, copper is continuously deposited on the cathode-while an equal amount of copper from the anode is dissolved into the solution and the density of copper sulphate solution remains unaltered.
This example also illustrates the basic principle of electroplating - a process of coating a thin layer of some expensive metal (gold, silver etc.) on an article of some cheap metal.

# 13.4 OHM'S LAW

We have seen that when a battery is connected across a conductor, an electric current begins to flow through it. How much current flows through the conductor when a certain potential difference is set up across its ends? The answer to this question was given by a German Physicist George Simon Ohm. He showed by elaborate experiments that the current through a metallic conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends. This fact is known as Ohms' law which states that
"The current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends provided the physical state such as temperature etc. of the conductor remains constant".

Symbolically Ohm's law can be written as

|  | $I \propto V$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| It implies that | $V=R I$ |

where $R$, the constant of proportionality is called the resistance of the conductor. The value of the resistance depends upon the nature, dimensions and the physical state of the conductor. In fact the resistance is a measure of the

opposition to the motion of electrons due to their continuous bumping with the atoms of the lattice. The unit of resistance is ohm. A conductor has a resistance of 1 ohm if a current of 1 ampere flows through it when a potential difference of 1 volt is applied across its ends. The symbol of ohm is $\Omega$. If $/$ is measured in amperes, $V$ in volts, then $R$ is measured in ohms i.e.,

$$
R(\text { ohms })=\frac{V(\text { volts })}{I(\text { amperes })}
$$

A sample of a conductor is said to obey Ohm's law if its resistance $R$ remains constant that is, the graph of its $V$ versus $/$ is exactly a straight line (Fig. 13.7). A conductor which strictly obeys Ohm's law is called ohmic. However, there are devices, which do not obey Ohms' law i.e., they are non ohmic. The examples of non ohmic devices are filament bulbs and semiconductor diodes.
Let us apply a certain potential difference across the terminals of a filament lamp and measure the resulting current passing through it. If we repeat the measurement for different values of potential difference and draw a graph of voltage $V$ versus current $I$, it will be seen that the graph is not a straight line (Fig. 13.8). It means that a filament is a non ohmic device. This deviation of $I-V$ graph from straight line is due to the increase in the resistance of the filament with temperature - a topic which is discussed in the next section. As the current passing through the filament is increased from zero, the graph is a straight line in the initial stage because the change in the resistance of the filament with temperature due to small current is not appreciable. As the current is further increased, the resistance of the filament continues to increase due to rise in its temperature.
Another example of non ohmic device is a semiconductor diode. The current - voltage plot of such a diode is shown in Fig. 13.9. The graph is not a straight line so semi conductor is also a non ohmic device.

# Review of Series and Parallel Combinations of Resistors

In an electrical circuit, usually, a number of resistors are connected together. There are two arrangements in which resistors can be connected with each other, one is known as series arrangement and other one as parallel arrangement.
If the resistors are connected end to end such that the same current passes through all of them, they are said to be connected in series as shown in Fig. 13.10(a). There

Fig. 13.10 (a)

Fig. 13.16 (b)
equivalent resistance $R_{e}$ is given by

$$
R_{e}=R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}+\cdots \cdots
$$

In parallel arrangement a number of resistors are connected side by side with their ends joined together at two common points as shown in Fig. 13.10(b). The equivalent resistance $R_{e}$ of this arrangement is given by

$$
\frac{1}{R_{e}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}+\cdots \cdots
$$

# 13.5 RESISTIVITY AND ITS DEPENDENCE UPON TEMPERATURE

It has been experimentally seen that the resistance $R$ of a wire is directly proportional to its length $L$ and inversely proportional to its cross sectional area $A$. Expressing mathematically we have

$$
R \propto \frac{L}{A}
$$

$$
\text { or } \quad R=\rho \frac{L}{A}
$$

where $\rho$ is a constant of proportionality known as resistivity of specific resistance of the material of the wire. It may be noted that resistance is the characteristic of a particular wire whereas the resistivity is the property of the material of which the wire is made. From Eq. 13.6 we have

$$
\rho=\frac{R A}{L}
$$

The above equation gives the definition of resistivity as the resistance of a metre cube of a material. The SI unit of resistivity is ohm-metre $(\Omega \mathrm{m})$.
Conductance is another quantity used to describe the electrical properties of materials. In fact conductance is the reciprocal of resistance i.e.,

$$
\text { Conductance }=\frac{1}{\text { resistance }(R)}
$$

The SI unit of conductance is mho or siemen.
Likewise conductivity, $\sigma$ is the reciprocal of resistivity i.e.,

$$
\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}
$$

The SI unit of conductivity is ohm ${ }^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ or $\mathrm{mh} \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. Resistivity of various materials are given in Table 13.1.
It may be noted from Table 13.1 that silver and copper are two best conductors. That is the reason that most electric wires are made of copper.
The resistivity of a substance depends upon the temperature also. It can be explained by recalling that the resistance offered by a conductor to the flow of electric current is due to collisions, which the free electrons encounter with atoms of the lattice. As the temperature of the conductor rises, the amplitude of vibration of the atoms in the lattice increases and hence, the probability of their collision with free electrons also increases. One may say that the atoms then offer a bigger target, that is, the collision cross-section of the atoms increases with temperature. This makes the collisions between free electrons and the atoms in the lattice more frequent and hence, the resistance of the conductor increases.
Experimentally the change in resistance of a metallic conductor with temperature is found to be nearly linear over a considerable range of temperature above and below $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (Fig. 13.11). Over such a range the fractional change in resistance per kelvin is known as the temperature coefficient of resistance i.e.,

$$
\alpha=\frac{R_{1}-R_{0}}{R_{0} t}
$$

where $R_{0}$ and $R_{t}$ are resistances at temperature $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $t^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. As resistivity $p$ depends upon the temperature, Eq. 13.6 gives $R_{0}=p_{0} L / A$ and $R_{0}=p_{0} L / A$
Substituting the values of $R_{t}$ and $R_{0}$ in Eq. 13.9, we get as

$$
\alpha=\frac{p_{1}-p_{0}}{\rho_{0} t}
$$

where $p_{0}$ is the resistivity of a conductor at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $p_{1}$ is the resistivity at $t^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Values of temperature co-efficients of resistivity of some substances are also listed in Table 13.1.
There are some substances like germanium, silicon etc., whose resistance decreases with increase in temperature. i.e., these substances have negative temperature coefficients.

Example 13.2: 0.75 A current flows through an iron wire when a battery of 1.5 V is connected across its ends. The

## length of the wire is 5.0 m and its cross sectional area is $2.5 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Compute the resistivity of iron.

## Solution:

The resistance $R$ of the wire can be calculated by Eq. 13.2 i.e.,

$$
R=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{1.5 \mathrm{~V}}{0.75 \mathrm{~A}}=2.0 \mathrm{VA}^{-1}=2.0 \Omega
$$

The resistivity $\rho$ of iron of which the wire is made is given by

$$
\rho=R \frac{A}{L}=\frac{2.0 \Omega \times 2.5 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~m}^{2}}{5.0 \mathrm{~m}}=1.0 \times 10^{-7} \Omega \mathrm{~m}
$$

Example 13.3: A platinum wire has resistance of $10 \Omega$ at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $20 \Omega$ at $273^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Find the value of temperature coefficient of resistance of platinum.

## Solution:

$$
R_{s}=10 \Omega, R_{t}=20 \Omega, t=546 \mathrm{~K}-273 \mathrm{~K}=273 \mathrm{~K}
$$

Temperature coefficient of resistance can be found by

$$
\alpha=\frac{R_{t}-R_{s}}{R_{0} t}=\frac{20 \Omega-10 \Omega}{10 \Omega \times 273 \mathrm{~K}}=\frac{1}{273 \mathrm{~K}}=3.66 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}
$$
