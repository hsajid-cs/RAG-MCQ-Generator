### 13.6 COLOUR CODE FOR CARBON RESISTANCES

Carbon resistors are most common in electronic equipment. They consist of a high-grade ceramic rod or cone (called the substrate) on which is deposited a thin resistive film of carbon. The numerical value of their resistance is indicated by a colour code which consists of bands of different colours printed on the body of the resistor. The colour used in this code and the digits represented by them are given in Table 13.2.
Usually the code consists of four bands (Fig. 13.12). Starting from left to right, the colour bands are interpreted as follows:

1. The first band indicates the first digit in the numerical value of the resistance.
2. The second band gives the second digit.
3. The third band is decimal multiplier i.e., it gives the number of zeros after the first two digits.
4. The fourth band gives resistance tolerance. Its colour is either silver or gold. Silver band indicates a tolerance of $\pm 10 \%$, a gold band shows a tolerance of

$\pm 5 \%$. If there is no fourth band, tolerance is understood to be $+20 \%$. By tolerance, we mean the possible variation from the marked value. For example, a $1000 \Omega$ resistor with a tolerance of $\pm 10 \%$ will have an actual resistance anywhere between $900 \Omega$ and $1100 \Omega$.

# Rheostat

It is a wire wound variable resistance. It consists of a bare manganin wire wound over an insulating cylinder. The ends of the wire are connected to two fixed terminals $A$ and $B$ (Fig. 13.13 a). A third terminal $C$ is attached to a sliding contact which can also be moved over the wire.

A rheostat can be used as a variable resistor as well as a potential divider. To use it as a variable resistor one of the fixed terminal say $A$ and the sliding terminal $C$ are inserted in the circuit (Fig. 13.13 b). In this way the resistance of the wire between $A$ and the sliding contact $C$ is used. If the sliding contact is shifted away from the terminal $A$, the length and hence the resistance included in the circuit increases and if the sliding contact is moved towards $A$, the resistance decreases. A rheostat can also be used as a potential divider.
This is illustrated in Fig. 13.14. A potential difference $V$ is applied across the ends $A$ and $B$ of the rheostat with the help of a battery. If $R$ is the resistance of wire $A B$, the current $I$ passing through it is given by $I=V / R$.
The potential difference between the portion $B C$ of the wire $A B$ is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_{\mathrm{ac}} & =\text { current } x \text { resistance } \\
& =\frac{V}{R} \times r=\frac{r}{R} V
\end{aligned}
$$

where $r$ is the resistance of the portion $B C$ of the wire. The circuit shown in Fig. 13.14 is known as potential divider. Eq.13.11 shows that this circuit can provide at its output terminals a potential difference varying from zero to the full potential difference of the battery depending on the position of the sliding contact. As the sliding contact $C$ is moved towards the end $B$, the length and hence the resistance $r$ of the portion $B C$ of the wire decreases which according to Eq. 13.11, decreases $V_{\text {ac }}$. On the other hand if the sliding contact $C$ is moved towards the end $A$, the output voltage $V_{\text {ac }}$ increases.

A zero-ohm resistor is indicated by a single black colour band around the body of the resistor.

## Thermistors

A thermistor is a heat sensitive resistor. Most thermistors have negative temperature coefficient of resistance i.e., the resistance of such thermistors decreases when their temperature is increased. Thermistors with positive temperature coefficient are also available.
Thermistors are made by heating under high pressure semiconductor ceramic made from mixtures of metallic oxides of manganese, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron etc. These are pressed into desired shapes and then baked at high temperature. Different types of thermistors are shown in Fig.13.15. They may be in the form of beads, rods or washers.
Thermistors with high negative temperature coefficient are very accurate for measuring low temperatures especially near 10 K . The higher resistance at low temperature enables more accurate measurement possible.
Thermistors have wide applications as temperature sensors i.e., they convert changes of temperature into electrical voltage which is duly processed.
