Materials have specific uses depending upon their characteristics and properties, such as hardness, ductility, malleability, conductivity etc. What makes steel hard, lead soft, iron magnetic and copper electrically conducting? It depends upon the structure - the particular order and bonding of atoms in a material. This clue has made it possible to design and create materials with new and unusual properties for use in modern technology.

### 17.1 CLASSIFICATION OF SOLIDS

## Crystalline Solids

In crystalline solids there is a regular arrangement of molecules. The neighbours of every molecule are arranged in a regular pattern that is constant throughout the crystal. There is, thus an ordered structure in crystalline solids.

The vast majority of solids, e.g., metals such as copper, iron and zinc, ionic compounds such as sodium chloride, ceramics such as zirconia are crystalline. The arrangement of molecules, atoms or ions within all types of crystalline solids can be studied using various X-ray techniques. It should be noted that atoms, molecules or ions in a crystalline solid are not static. For example, each atom in a metal crystal vibrates about a fixed point with an amplitude that increases with rise in temperature. It is the average atomic positions which are perfectly ordered over large distances.

The cohesive forces between atoms, molecules or ions in crystalline solids maintain the strict long-range order inspite of atomic vibrations. For every crystal, however, there is a temperature at which the vibrations become so great that the structure suddenly breaks up, and the solid melts. The transition from solid (order) to liquid (disorder) is, therefore, abrupt or discontinuous. Every crystalline solid has a definite melting point.

# Amorphous or Glassy Solids

The word amorphous means without form or structure. Thus in amorphous solids there is no regular arrangement of molecules like that in crystalline solids. We can, therefore, say that amorphous solids are more like liquids with the disordered structure frozen in.

For example ordinary glass, which is a solid at ordinary temperature, has no regular arrangement of molecules. On heating, it gradually softens into a paste like state before it becomes a very viscous liquid at almost $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Thus amorphous solids are also called glassy solids. This type of solids have no definite melting point.

## Polymeric Solids

Polymers may be said to be more or less solid materials with a structure that is intermediate between order and disorder. They can be classified as partially or poorly crystalline solids.

Polymers form a large group of naturally occurring and synthetic materials. Plastics and synthetic rubbers are termed 'Ploymers' because they are formed by polymerization reactions in which relatively simple molecules are chemically combined into massive long chain molecules, or "three dimensional" structures. These materials have rather low specific gravity compared with even the lightest of metals, and

yet exhibit good strength-to-weight ratio.
Polymers consist wholly or in part of chemical combinations of carbon with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and other metallic or non-metallic elements. Polythene, polystrene and nylon etc., are examples of polymers. Natural rubber is composed in the pure state entirely of a hydrocarbon with the formula $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{8}\right)_{n}$.

# Crystal Lattice

A crystalline solid consists of three dimensional pattern that repeats itself over and over again. This smallest three dimensional basic structure is called unit cell. The whole structure obtained by the repetition of unit cell is known as crystal lattice. For example, the pattern of NaCl particles have a cube shape. The cube shape of the sodium chloride is just one of several crystal shapes. In a cubic crystal all the sides meet at right angles. Other crystal shapes have corners in which one or more of the angles are not right angles.

### 17.2 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS

## Deformation in Solids

If we hold a soft rubber ball in our hand and then squeeze it, the shape or volume of the ball will change. However, if we stop squeezing the ball, and open our hand, the ball will return to its original spherical shape. This has been illustrated schematically in Fig.17.1.
Similarly, if we hold two ends of a rubber string in our hands, and move our hands apart to some extent, the length of the string will increase under the action of the applied force exerted by our hands. Greater the applied force larger will be the increase in length. Now on removing the applied force, the string will return to its original length. From these examples, it is concluded that deformation (i.e., change in shape, length or volume) is produced when a body is subjected to some external force.
In crystalline solids atoms are usually arranged in a certain order. These atoms are held about their equilibrium position, which depends on the strength of the inter-atomic cohesive force between them. When external force is applied on such a body, a distortion results because of the displacement of the atoms from their equilibrium position and the body is said to be in a state of stress. After the removal of external force,

the atoms return to their equilibrium position, and the body regains its original shape, provided that external applied force was not too great. The ability of the body to return to its original shape is called elasticity. Fig.17.2 illustrates deformation produced in a unit cell of a crystal subjected to an external applied force.

## Stress and Strain

The results of mechanical tests are usually expressed in terms of stress and strain, which are defined in terms of applied force and deformation.

## Stress

It is defined as the force applied on unit area to produce any change in the shape, volume or length of a body. Mathematically it is expressed as

$$
\text { Stress }(\sigma)=\frac{\text { Force }(F)}{\text { Area }(A)}
$$

The SI unit of stress ( $\sigma$ ) is newton per square metre ( $\mathrm{Nm}^{-2}$ ), which is given the name pascal (Pa).
Stress may cause a change in length, volume and shape. When a stress changes length, it is called the tensile stress, when it changes the volume it is called the volume stress and when it changes the shape it is called the shear stress.

## Strain

Strain is a measure of the deformation of a solid when stress is applied to it. In the case of deformation in one dimension, strain is defined as the fractional change in length. If $\Delta \ell$ is the change in length and $\ell$ is the original length (Fig. 17.3 a), then strain is given by

$$
\text { Strain }(\varepsilon)=\frac{\text { Change in length }(\Delta \ell)}{\text { Original length }(\ell)}
$$

Since strain is ratio of lengths, it is dimensionless, and therefore, has no units. If strain $\varepsilon$ is due to tensile stress $\sigma$, it is called tensile strain, and if it is produced as a result of compressive stress $\sigma$, it is termed as compressive strain.
In case when the applied stress changes the volume, the change in volume per unit volume is known as volumetric strain (Fig. 17.3 b). Thus

$$
\text { Volumetric strain }=\frac{\Delta V}{V_{0}}
$$

Now referring to Fig. 17.3 (c), when the opposite faces of a rigid cube are subjected to shear stress, the shear strain produced is given by

$$
\gamma=\frac{\Delta a}{a}=\tan \theta
$$

However, for small values of angle $\theta$, measured in radian, $\tan \theta=\theta$, so that

$$
\gamma=\theta
$$

Since strain is a dimensionless quantity, the units of modulus of elasticity are the same as those of stress, i.e., $\mathrm{Nm}^{-3}$ or Pa .
In the case of linear deformation, the ratio of tensile (or compressive) stress $\sigma(=F / A)$ to tensile (or compressive) strain $\varepsilon=\Delta \ell / \ell$ is called Young's modulus.

$$
Y=\frac{F / A}{\Delta \ell / \ell}
$$

For three dimensional deformation, when volume is involved, then the ratio of applied stress to volumetric strain is called Bulk modulus.

$$
K=\frac{F / A}{\Delta V / V}
$$

where $\Delta V$ is the change in original volume $V$.
However, when the shear stress $\tau=(F / A)$ and shear strain $\gamma(=\tan \theta)$ are involved, then their ratio is called shear modulus.

$$
G=\frac{F / A}{\tan \theta}
$$

## There are seven different crystals systems based on the geometrical arrangement of their atoms and the resultant geometrical structures.

Fig.17.4 Stress-strain curve of a typical ductile material.

Elastic constants for some of the materials are given in Table 17.1.

## Elastic Form and Yield Strength

In a tensile test, metal wire is extended at a specified deformation rate, and stresses generated in the wire during deformation are continuously measured by a suitable electronic device fitted in the mechanical testing machine. Force-elongation diagram or stress-strain curve is plotted automatically on X-Y chart recorder. A typical stress-strain curve for a ductile material is shown in Fig. 17.4.
In the initial stage of deformation, stress is increased linearly with the strain till we reach point $A$ on the stress-strain curve. This is called proportional limit ( $\sigma_{p}$ ). It is defined as the greatest stress that a material can endure without losing straight line proportionality between .stress and strain. Hooke's law which states that the strain is directly proportional to stress is obeyed in the region OA. From A to $B$, stress and strain are not proportional, but nevertheless, if the load is removed at any point between $O$ and $B$, the curve will be retraced and the material will return to its original length. In the region OB, the material is said to be elastic. The point $B$ is called the yield point. The value of stress at $B$ is known as elastic limit $\sigma_{e}$. If the stress is increased beyond the yield stress or elastic limit of the material, the specimen becomes permanently changed and does not recover its original shape or dimension after the stress is removed. This kind of behaviour is called plasticity.

The region of plasticity is represented by the portion of the curve from $B$ to $C$, the point $C$ in Fig. 17.4 represents the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) $\sigma_{m}$ of the material. The UTS is defined as the maximum stress that a material can withstand, and can be regarded as the nominal strength of the material. Once point $C$ corresponding to UTS is crossed, the material breaks at point $D$, responding the fracture stress $\left(\sigma_{f}\right)$.

Substances which undergo plastic deformation until they break, are known as ductile substances. Lead, copper and wrought iron are ductile. Other substances which break just after the elastic limit is reached, are known as brittle substances. Glass and high carbon steel are brittle.
Example 17.1: A steel wire 12 mm in diameter is fastened

to a log and is then pulled by tractor. The length of steel wire between the log and the tractor is 11 m . A force of $10,000 \mathrm{~N}$ is required to pull the log. Calculate (a) the stress in the wire and (b) the strain in the wire. (c) How much does the wire stretch when the log is pulled? $\left(E=200 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{Nm}^{-3}\right)$

## Solution:

(a) As tensile stress $\sigma=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{10,000 \mathrm{~N}}{3.14 \times\left(6 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}\right)^{2}}$

$$
=88.46 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{-2}=88.46 \mathrm{MPa}
$$

(b) The tensile strain $\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta \ell}{\ell}$

Also $\quad E=\frac{\text { Stress }}{\text { Strain }}=\frac{88.46 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{-2}}{\text { Strain }}=200 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{Nm}^{-2}$

$$
\text { Strain }=\frac{88.46 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{-2}}{200 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{Nm}^{-2}}=4.4 \times 10^{-4}
$$

(c) Now using the relation Strain $=\frac{\Delta \ell}{\ell}$, we get

$$
\Delta \ell=4.4 \times 10^{-4} \times 11 \mathrm{~m}=4.84 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}=4.84 \mathrm{~mm}
$$

## Strain Energy in Deformed Materials

Consider a wire suspended vertically from one end. It is stretched by attaching a weight at the other end. We can increase the stretching force by increasing the weight. By noting the extension $\ell$ of the wire for different values of the stretching force $F$, a graph can be drawn between the force $F$ and the extension $\ell$ (Fig.17.5). If the elastic limit is not exceeded, the extension is directly proportional to force $F$. As the force $F$ stretches the wire, it does some amount of work on wire which is equal to product of force $F$ and the extension $\ell$. Suppose we are required to find the amount of the work done when the extension is $\ell_{1}$. Let the force for this extension be $F_{1}$. Fig. 17.5 shows that the force $F$ does not remain constant in producing the extension $\ell_{1}$, it varies uniformly from 0 to $F_{1}$. In such a situation the work is calculated by graphical method.
Suppose at some stage before the extension $\ell_{1}$ is reached, the force in the wire is $F$ and that the wire now extends by a very small amount $\Delta x$. The extension $\Delta x$ is so small that the force $F$ may be assumed constant in $\Delta x$, so the work done in producing this small extension is $F \times \Delta x$. In the figure it can be

## This is a machine used to investigate the way the extension of a material varies with the force stretching it.
Energy in stretched wire
Fig. 17.5

seen that it is represented by the area of the shaded strip. In this way the total extension $\ell_{1}$ can be divided into very small extensions and the work done during each of these small extensions would be given by the area of the strips (Fig. 17.5). So the total work done in producing the extension $\ell_{1}$ is the sum area of all these strips which is equal to area between the graph and the axis on which extension has been plotted upto $\ell=\ell_{1}$. In this case it equals to area of the triangle OAB.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \text { Work done } & =\text { Area of } \Delta \mathrm{OAB} \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{OAxAB}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
=\frac{1}{2} \ell_{1} \times F_{1}
$$

This is the amount of energy stored in the wire. It is the gain in the potential energy of the molecules due to their displacement from their mean positions. Eq. 17.9 gives the energy in joules when $F$ is in newton and $\ell$ in metres.

Eq.17.9 can also be expressed in terms of modulus of elasticity $E$. If $A$ is the area of cross-section of the wire and $L$ its total length then
or

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E=\frac{F_{1}}{A} \times \frac{L}{\ell_{1}} \\
& F_{1}=\frac{E A \times \ell_{1}}{L}
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting the value of $F_{1}$ in Eq. 17.9 we have

$$
\text { Work done }=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{E A \times \ell_{1}^{2}}{L}\right]
$$

The area method is quite a general one. For example if the extension is increased from $\ell_{1}$ to $\ell_{2}$, the amount of work done by the stretching force would be given by the area of the trapezium ABCD (Fig.17.5). It is also valid for both the linear (elastic) and the non-linear (non-elastic) parts of the forceextension graph. If the extension occurs from $O$ to $G$ (Fig.17.5), this work done would be the area of OHG.

# 17.3 ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS

The fundamental electrical property of a solid is its response to an applied electric field, i.e., its ability to conduct electric current. The electrical behaviours of various materials are

diverse. Some are very good conductors, e.g., metals with conductivities of the order of $10^{7}(\Omega \mathrm{~m})^{1}$. At the other extreme, some solids, e.g., wood, diamond etc., have very low conductivities ranging between $10^{-10}$ and $10^{-20}(\Omega \mathrm{~m})^{11}$, these are called insulators. Solids with intermediate conductivities, generally from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-4}(\Omega \mathrm{~m})^{11}$, are termed semiconductors, e.g., silicon, germanium etc. The conventional free electron theory based on Bohr model of electron distribution in an atom failed to explain completely the vast diversity in the electrical behaviour of these three types of materials.
On the other hand, energy band theory based on wave mechanical model has been found successful in resolving the problem.

# Energy Band Theory

Electrons of an isolated atom are bound to the nucleus, and can only have distinct energy levels. However, when a large number of atoms, say N , are brought close to one another to form a solid, each energy level of the isolated atom splits into N sub-levels, called states, under the action of the forces exerted by other atoms in the solid. These permissible energy states are discrete but so closely spaced that they appear to form a continuous energy band. In between two consecutive permissible energy bands, there is a range of energy states which cannot be occupied by electrons. These are called forbidden energy states, and its range is termed as forbidden energy gap.
The electrons in the outermost shell of an atom are called valence electrons and the energy band occupying these electrons is known as valence band. It is obviously the highest occupied band. It may be either completely filled or partially filled with electrons and can never be empty. The band above the valence band is called conduction band. In conduction band, electrons move freely and conduct electric current through solids. That is why the electrons occupying this band are known as conductive electrons or free electrons. Any electron leaving the valence band is accommodated by this band. It may be either empty or partially filled with electrons. The bands below the valence band are normally completely filled and as such play no part in the conduction process. Thus, while discussing the electrical conductivity we will consider only the valence and conduction bands.

## Glass is also known as solid liquid because its molecules are irregularly arranged as in a liquid but fixed in their relative positions.

Insulators Insulators are those materials in which valence electrons are bound very tightly to their atoms and are not free. In terms of energy bands, it means that an insulator, as shown in Fig. 17.6 has
a) an empty conduction band (no free electrons)
b) a full valence band
c) a large energy gap (several eV ) between them

Conductors Conductors are those which have plenty of free electrons for electrical conduction. In terms of energy bands, conductors are those materials in which valence and conduction bands largely overlap each other (Fig.17.7). There is no physical distinction between the two bands which ensures the availability of a large number of free electrons.
Semiconductors In terms of energy bands, semiconductors are those materials which at room temperature have
(i) partially filled conduction band (ii) partially filled valence band (iii) a very narrow forbidden energy gap (of the order of 1 eV ) between the conduction and valence bands (Fig.17.8).
At 0 K , there are no electrons in the conduction band and their valence band are completely filled. It means at 0 K , a piece of Ge or Si is a perfect insulator. However, with increase in temperature, some electrons posses sufficient energy to jump across the small energy gap from valence to conduction band. This transfers some free electrons in the conduction bands and creates some vacancies of electrons in the valence band. The vacancy of electron in the valence band is known as a hole. It behaves like a positive charge. Thus at room temperature, Ge or Si crystal becomes a semiconductor.

# Intrinsic and Extrinsic Semi-conductor

A semi-conductor in its extremely pure form is known as intrinsic semi-conductor. The electrical behaviour of semiconductor is extremely sensitive to the purity of the material. It is substantially changed on introducing a small amount of impurity into the pure semi-conductor lattice. The process is called doping, in which a small number of atoms of some other suitable elements are added as impurity in the ratio of 1 to $10^{6}$. The doped semi-conducting materials are called extrinsic semi-conductors.
Pure element of silicon and germanium are intrinsic

semi-conductors. These semi-conductor elements have atoms with four valence electrons. In solid crystalline form, the atoms of these elements arrange themselves in such a pattern that each atom has four equidistant neighbours. Fig. 17.9 shows this pattern along with its valence electrons. Each atom with its four valence electrons, shares an electron from its neighbours. This effectively allocates eight electrons in the outermost shell of each atom which is a stable state. This sharing of electrons between two atoms creates covalent bonds. Due to these covalent bonds electrons are bound in their respective shells.

When a silicon crystal is doped with a pentavalent element, e.g., arsenic, antimony or phosphorous etc., four valence electrons of the impurity atom form covalent bond with the four neighbouring Si atoms, while the fifth valence electron provides a free electron in the crystal. Such a doped or extrinsic semi-conductor is called n-type semi-conductor. Fig. 17.10(a) illustrates silicon crystal lattice doped with a pentavalent impurity such as phosphorous. The phosphorous atom is called a donor atom because it readily donates a free electron, which is thermally excited into the conduction band.
On the other hand, when a silicon crystal is doped with a trivalent element, e.g., aluminium, boron, gallium or indium etc., three valence electrons of the impurity atom form covalent bond with the three neighbouring Si atoms, while the one missing electron in the covalent bond with the fourth neighbouring Si atom, is called a hole which in fact is vacancy where an electron can be accommodated. Such a semiconductor is called p-type semi-conductor. Fig. 17.10 (b) illustrates silicon crystal lattice doped with aluminium. The aluminium atom is called an acceptor atom because it is easy for the aluminium ion core to accept a valence electron from a nearby silicon atom, thus creating a hole in the valence bond.

# Electrical Conduction by Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors

Consider a semi-conductor crystal lattice, e.g., Ge or Si as shown in Fig. 17.11. The circles represent the positiveion cores of Si or Ge atoms, and the blue dots are valence electrons. These electrons are bound by covalent bond. However, at room temperature they have thermal kinetic motion which, in case of some electrons, is so vigorous that
(a)
(b)

Fig. 17.10
Fig. 17.11

Fig. 17.12
the covalent bond is unable to keep them bound. In such cases the electrons break the covalent bond and get themselves free leaving a vacant seat for an electron, i.e., a hole. Thus whenever a covalent bond is broken, an electronhole pair is created. Both the electrons and the holes move in the semi-conductor crystal lattice as explained below.
Consider a row of Si atoms in crystal lattice. Suppose a hole is present in the valence shell of atom $A$. As hole is a deficiency of electron, so the core of atom $A$ would have a net positive charge (Fig. 17.12 a). This attracts an electron from a neighbouring atom say B. Thus the electron moves from $B$ to $A$ and the hole ( +ve charge) shifts to $B$ (Fig. 17.12 a,b). Now an electron is attracted from $C$ to $B$ and a hole is created at $C$ (Fig. 17.12 b,c) and positive charge appears at $C$. This process is repeated between the atoms $C$ and $D$ with the result that the electron moves from $D$ to $C$ and the hole ( +ve charge) appears at $D$ (Fig. 17.12 c,d). Thus we notice that if a hole is present in any valence shell, it cannot stay there but it moves from one atom to other with the electron moving in opposite direction. Secondly we notice that the appearance of hole is accompanied by a positive charge. Thus a moving hole is equivalent to a moving positive charge.
In this example we have considered a special case in which the electron and the hole are moving in a straight line. Actually their motion is random because positively charged core of the atom can attract an electron from any of its neighbouring atoms.
Thus, in semi-conductors there are two kinds of charge carriers; a free electron $(-e)$ and a hole $(+e)$.
When a battery is connected to a semi-conductor, it establishes an electric field across it due to which a directed flow of electrons and holes takes place. The electrons drift towards the positive end, whereas the holes drift towards the negative end of the semi-conductor (Fig.17.13). The current $I$ flowing through the semi-conductor is carried by both electrons and holes. It may be noted that the electronic current and the hole current add up together to give the current $I$.

# 17.4 SUPERCONDUCTORS

There are some materials whose resistivity becomes zero below a certain temperature $T_{c}$ called critical temperature as shown in resistivity-temperature graph in Fig. 17.14. Below this temperature, such materials are called superconductors.

They offer no resistance to electric current and are, therefore, perfect conductors. Once the resistance of a material drops to zero, no energy is dissipated and the current, once established, continues to exist indefinitely without the source of an emf.

The first superconductor was discovered in 1911 by Kmaerlingh Omes when it was observed that electrical resistance of mercury disappears suddenly as the temperature is reduced below 4.2 K . Some other metals such as aluminium $\left(T_{c}=1.18 \mathrm{~K}\right)$, tin $\left(T_{c}=3.72 \mathrm{~K}\right)$, and lead $\left(T_{c}=7.2 \mathrm{~K}\right)$ also become superconductors at very low temperatures. In 1986 a new class of ceramic materials was discovered that becomes superconductor at temperatures as high as 125 K . Any superconductor with a critical temperature above 77 K , the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, is referred as a high temperature superconductor.

Recently a complex crystalline structure known as Yttrium barium copper oxide $\left(\mathrm{YBa}_{2} \mathrm{Cu}_{3}, \mathrm{O}_{1}\right)$ have been reported to become superconductor at 163 K or $-110^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ by Prof. Yao Lian's Lee at Cambridge University. Perhaps one day even room temperature superconductor will be developed and that day will be a new revolution in electrical technologies. Superconductors have many technological applications such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic levitation trains, powerful but small electric motors and faster computer chips.

### 17.5 MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS

From the study of the magnetic fields produced by bar magnets and moving charges, i.e., currents, it is possible to trace the origin of the magnetic properties of the material. It is observed that the field of a long bar magnet is like the field produced by a long solenoid carrying current and the field of a short bar magnet resembles that of a single loop (Fig.17.15). This similarity between the fields produced by magnets and currents urges an enquiring mind to think that all magnetic effects may be due to circulating currents (i.e., moving charges); a view first held by Ampere. The idea was not considered very favourably in Ampere's time because the structure of atom was not known at that time. Taking into consideration, the internal structure of atom, discovered thereafter, the Ampere's view appears to be basically correct.
The magnetism produced by electrons within an atom can

arise from two motions. First, each electron orbiting the nucleus behaves like an atomic sized loop of current that generates a small magnetic field; this situation is similar to the field created by the current loop in Fig. 17.15 (d). Secondly each electron possesses a spin that also gives rise to a magnetic field. The net magnetic field created by the electrons within an atom is due to the combined field created by their orbital and spin motions. Since there are a number of electrons in an atom, their currents or spins may be so oriented or aligned as to cancel the magnetic effects mutually or strengthen the effects of each other. An atom in which there is a resultant magnetic field, behaves like a tiny magnet and is called a magnetic dipole. The magnetic fields of the atoms are responsible for the magnetic behaviour of the substance made up of these atoms. Magnetism is, therefore, due to the spin and orbital motion of the electrons surrounding the nucleus and is thus a property of all substances. It may be mentioned that the charged nucleus itself spins giving rise to a magnetic field. However, it is much weaker than that of the orbital electrons. Thus the source of magnetism of an atom is the electrons. Accepting this view of magnetism it is concluded that it is impossible to obtain an isolated north pole. The north-pole is merely one side of a current loop. The other side will always be present as a south pole and these cannot be separated. This is an experimental reality.
Two cases arise which have to be distinguished. In the first case, the orbits and the spin axes of the electrons in an atom are so oriented that their fields support each other and the atom behaves like a tiny magnet. Substances with such atoms are called paramagnetic substances. In second type of atoms there is no resultant field as the magnetic fields produced by both orbital and spin motions of the electrons might add upto zero. These are called diamagnetic substances, for example the atoms of water, copper, bismuth and antimony.
However, there are some solid substances e.g., $\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Co}, \mathrm{Ni}$, Chromium dioxide, and Alnico (an iron aluminium - nickel - cobalt alloy) in which the atoms co-operate with each other in such a way so as to exhibit a strong magnetic effect. They are called ferromagnetic substances. Ferromagnetic materials are of great interest for electrical engineers.
Recent studies of ferromagnetism have shown that there exists in ferromagnetic substance small regions called 'domains'. The domains are of macroscopic size of the order

of millimetres or less but large enough to contain $10^{12}$ to $10^{14}$ atoms. Within each domain the magnetic fields of all the spinning electrons are parallel to one another i.e., each domain is magnetized to saturation. Each domain behaves as a small magnet with its own north and south poles. In unmagnetised iron the domains are oriented in a disorderly fashion (Fig.17.16), so that the net magnetic effect of a sizeable specimen is zero. When the specimen is placed in an external magnetic field as that of a solenoid, the domains line up parallel to lines of external magnetic field and the entire specimen becomes saturated (Fig.17.17). The combination of a solenoid and a specimen of iron inside it thus makes a powerful magnet and is called an electromagnet.
Iron is a soft magnetic material. Its domains are easily oriented on applying an external field and also readily return to random positions when the field is removed. This is desirable in an electromagnet and also in transformers. Domains in steel, on the other hand, are not so easily oriented to order. They require very strong external fields, but once oriented, retain the alignment. Thus steel makes a good permanent magnet and is known as hard magnetic material and another such material is a special alloy Alnico V.
Finally, it must be mentioned that thermal vibrations tend to disturb the orderliness of the domains. Ferromagnetic materials preserve the orderliness at ordinary temperatures. When heated, they begin to lose their orderliness due to the increased thermal motion. This process begins to occur at a particular temperature (different for different materials) called Curie temperature. Above the Curie temperature iron is paramagnetic but not ferromagnetic. The Curie temperature for iron is about $750^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

## Hysteresis Loop

To investigate a ferromagnetic material, a bar of that material such as iron is placed in an alternating current solenoid. When the alternating current is at its positive peak value, it fully magnetises the specimen in one direction and when the current is at its negative peak, it fully magnetises it in opposite direction. Thus as the alternating current changes from its positive peak value to its negative peak value and then back to its positive peak value, the specimen undergoes a complete cycle of magnetization. The flux density versus the magnetization current of the specimen for the various values of magnetizing current of the solenoid is plotted by a CRO (Fig.17.18).

Its main features are as follows:

# 1. Hysteresis

The portion of OA of the curve is obtained when the magnetizing current / is increased and AR is the portion when the current is decreased. It may be noted that the value of flux density for any value of current is always greater when the current is decreasing than when it is increasing, i.e., magnetism lags behind the magnetizing current. This phenomenon is known as hysteresis.

## 2. Saturation

The magnetic flux density increases from zero and reaches a maximum value. At this stage the material is said to be magnetically saturated.

## 3. Remanence or Relantivity

When the current is reduced to zero, the material still remains strongly magnetized represented by point $R$ on the curve. It is due to the tendency of domains to stay partly in line, once they have been aligned.

## 4. Coercivity

To demagnetize the material, the magnetizing current is reversed and increased to reduce the magnetization to zero. This is known as coercive current represented by C on the curve. The coercivity of steel (Fig. 17.19 a), is more than that of iron as more current is needed to demagnetize it. Once the material is magnetized, its magnetization curve never passes through the origin. Instead, it forms the closed loop $\mathrm{ACDC}^{\prime} \mathrm{A}$, which is called hysteresis loop.

## 5. Area of the Loop

The area of the loop is a measure of the energy needed to magnetize and demagnetize the specimen during each cycle of the magnetizing current. This is the energy required to do work against internal friction of the domains. This work, like all work that is done against friction, is dissipated as heat. It is called hysteresis loss.
Hard magnetic materials like steel can not be easily magnetized or demagnetized, so they have large loop area as compared to soft magnetic material such as iron which can easily be magnetized. The energy dissipated per cycle, thus, for iron is less than for steel.

OC = Coercivity

Suitability of magnetic materials for different purposes can be studied by taking the specimen through a complete cycle and drawing the hysteresis loop. A material with high retentivity and large coercive force would be most suitable to make a permanent magnet. The cores of electromagnets used for alternating currents where the specimen repeatedly undergoes magnetization and demagnetization should have narrow hysteresis curves of small area to minimize the waste of energy.
A bullet train is lifted above the rails due to magnetic effect, thus friction is reduced to minimum and speed can be enhanced up to $500 \mathrm{~kmh}^{2}$.

# SUMMARY

- $\quad$ Crystalline solids are those in which there is a regular arrangement of molecules. The neighbours of every molecule are arranged in a regular pattern that is constant through out the crystal. Thus, there is an ordered structure in crystalline solids.
- In amorphous solids there is no regular arrangement of molecules. These are more like liquids with the disordered structure frozen in.
- Polymers may be said to be more or less solid materials with a structure that is intermediate between order and disorder. These can be classified as partially or poorly crystalline solids.
- A crystalline solid consists of three dimensional pattern that repeats itself over and over again. This basic structure is called unit cell.
- $\quad$ The force applied on unit area to produce any change in the shape, volume or length of a body is called stress.
- When a long wire of length $l$ with area of cross section $A$ is being pulled by a force $F$, which results in an increase in length $\Delta l$, the stress is called tensile deformation.
- When a small cylinder is subjected to a force $F$ along the inward drawn normal to its area of cross section $A$ to reduce its length, the stress is called compressive stress and deformation produced by it is called compressive deformation.
- If a force $F$ is applied tangentially to the surface of the opposite face of a cube to deform or twist it through an angle $\theta$, the stress is termed as shear stress.
- Strain is a measure of the deformation of a solid when stress is applied to it. In the case of deformation in one dimension, strain is defined as the fractional change in length per unit length. If strain is due to tensile stress, it is called tensile strain and if it is produced as a result of compressive stress, it is termed as compressive strain.
- $\quad$ The ratio of stress to strain is a constant for a given material, provided the external applied force is not too great. This is called modulus of elasticity.
- $\quad$ The strain energy can be obtained by the area of the force-extension graph.
- $\quad$ The electrical behaviour of semi-conductor is substantially changed on introducing

a small amount of impurity into the pure semi-conductor lattice. The process is called doping in which a small number of atoms of some other suitable elements are added as impurity. The doped semi-conducting materials are called extrinsic.

- When a silicon crystal is doped with a pentavalent element, four valence electrons of the impurity atom form covalent bond with the neighbouring Si atoms, while the fifth valence electron provides a free electron in the crystal. Such a doped or extrinsic semi-conductor is called n-type semi-conductor.
- There are some materials whose resistivity becomes zero below a certain temperature $T_{c}$, called critical temperature. Below this temperature, such materials are called superconductors.
- Substances in which the orbits and the spin axes of the electrons in an atom are so oriented that their magnetic fields support each other and the atom behaves like a tiny magnet are called paramagnetic substances.
- The substances in which magnetic fields produced by orbital and spin molecules of the electrons add up to zero are called diamagnetic substances.
- Substances in which the atoms co-operate with each other in such a way so as to exhibit a strong magnetic effect are called ferromagnetic.
