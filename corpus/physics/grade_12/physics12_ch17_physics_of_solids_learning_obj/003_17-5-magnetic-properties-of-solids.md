### 17.5 MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS

From the study of the magnetic fields produced by bar magnets and moving charges, i.e., currents, it is possible to trace the origin of the magnetic properties of the material. It is observed that the field of a long bar magnet is like the field produced by a long solenoid carrying current and the field of a short bar magnet resembles that of a single loop (Fig.17.15). This similarity between the fields produced by magnets and currents urges an enquiring mind to think that all magnetic effects may be due to circulating currents (i.e., moving charges); a view first held by Ampere. The idea was not considered very favourably in Ampere's time because the structure of atom was not known at that time. Taking into consideration, the internal structure of atom, discovered thereafter, the Ampere's view appears to be basically correct.

arise from two motions. First, each electron orbiting the nucleus behaves like an atomic sized loop of current that generates a small magnetic field; this situation is similar to the field created by the current loop in Fig. 17.15 (d). Secondly each electron possesses a spin that also gives rise to a magnetic field. The net magnetic field created by the electrons within an atom is due to the combined field created by their orbital and spin motions. Since there are a number of electrons in an atom, their currents or spins may be so oriented or aligned as to cancel the magnetic effects mutually or strengthen the effects of each other. An atom in which there is a resultant magnetic field, behaves like a tiny magnet and is called a magnetic dipole. The magnetic fields of the atoms are responsible for the magnetic behaviour of the substance made up of these atoms. Magnetism is, therefore, due to the spin and orbital motion of the electrons surrounding the nucleus and is thus a property of all substances. It may be mentioned that the charged nucleus itself spins giving rise to a magnetic field. However, it is much weaker than that of the orbital electrons. Thus the source of magnetism of an atom is the electrons. Accepting this view of magnetism it is concluded that it is impossible to obtain an isolated north pole. The north-pole is merely one side of a current loop. The other side will always be present as a south pole and these cannot be separated. This is an experimental reality.
Two cases arise which have to be distinguished. In the first case, the orbits and the spin axes of the electrons in an atom are so oriented that their fields support each other and the atom behaves like a tiny magnet. Substances with such atoms are called paramagnetic substances. In second type of atoms there is no resultant field as the magnetic fields produced by both orbital and spin motions of the electrons might add upto zero. These are called diamagnetic substances, for example the atoms of water, copper, bismuth and antimony.
However, there are some solid substances e.g., $\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Co}, \mathrm{Ni}$, Chromium dioxide, and Alnico (an iron aluminium - nickel - cobalt alloy) in which the atoms co-operate with each other in such a way so as to exhibit a strong magnetic effect. They are called ferromagnetic substances. Ferromagnetic materials are of great interest for electrical engineers.
Recent studies of ferromagnetism have shown that there exists in ferromagnetic substance small regions called 'domains'. The domains are of macroscopic size of the order

of millimetres or less but large enough to contain $10^{12}$ to $10^{14}$ atoms. Within each domain the magnetic fields of all the spinning electrons are parallel to one another i.e., each domain is magnetized to saturation. Each domain behaves as a small magnet with its own north and south poles. In unmagnetised iron the domains are oriented in a disorderly fashion (Fig.17.16), so that the net magnetic effect of a sizeable specimen is zero. When the specimen is placed in an external magnetic field as that of a solenoid, the domains line up parallel to lines of external magnetic field and the entire specimen becomes saturated (Fig.17.17). The combination of a solenoid and a specimen of iron inside it thus makes a powerful magnet and is called an electromagnet.
Iron is a soft magnetic material. Its domains are easily oriented on applying an external field and also readily return to random positions when the field is removed. This is desirable in an electromagnet and also in transformers. Domains in steel, on the other hand, are not so easily oriented to order. They require very strong external fields, but once oriented, retain the alignment. Thus steel makes a good permanent magnet and is known as hard magnetic material and another such material is a special alloy Alnico V.
Finally, it must be mentioned that thermal vibrations tend to disturb the orderliness of the domains. Ferromagnetic materials preserve the orderliness at ordinary temperatures. When heated, they begin to lose their orderliness due to the increased thermal motion. This process begins to occur at a particular temperature (different for different materials) called Curie temperature. Above the Curie temperature iron is paramagnetic but not ferromagnetic. The Curie temperature for iron is about $750^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

## Hysteresis Loop

To investigate a ferromagnetic material, a bar of that material such as iron is placed in an alternating current solenoid. When the alternating current is at its positive peak value, it fully magnetises the specimen in one direction and when the current is at its negative peak, it fully magnetises it in opposite direction. Thus as the alternating current changes from its positive peak value to its negative peak value and then back to its positive peak value, the specimen undergoes a complete cycle of magnetization. The flux density versus the magnetization current of the specimen for the various values of magnetizing current of the solenoid is plotted by a CRO (Fig.17.18).

Its main features are as follows:

# 1. Hysteresis

The portion of OA of the curve is obtained when the magnetizing current / is increased and AR is the portion when the current is decreased. It may be noted that the value of flux density for any value of current is always greater when the current is decreasing than when it is increasing, i.e., magnetism lags behind the magnetizing current. This phenomenon is known as hysteresis.

## 2. Saturation

The magnetic flux density increases from zero and reaches a maximum value. At this stage the material is said to be magnetically saturated.

## 3. Remanence or Relantivity

When the current is reduced to zero, the material still remains strongly magnetized represented by point $R$ on the curve. It is due to the tendency of domains to stay partly in line, once they have been aligned.

## 4. Coercivity

To demagnetize the material, the magnetizing current is reversed and increased to reduce the magnetization to zero. This is known as coercive current represented by C on the curve. The coercivity of steel (Fig. 17.19 a), is more than that of iron as more current is needed to demagnetize it. Once the material is magnetized, its magnetization curve never passes through the origin. Instead, it forms the closed loop $\mathrm{ACDC}^{\prime} \mathrm{A}$, which is called hysteresis loop.

## 5. Area of the Loop

The area of the loop is a measure of the energy needed to magnetize and demagnetize the specimen during each cycle of the magnetizing current. This is the energy required to do work against internal friction of the domains. This work, like all work that is done against friction, is dissipated as heat. It is called hysteresis loss.
Hard magnetic materials like steel can not be easily magnetized or demagnetized, so they have large loop area as compared to soft magnetic material such as iron which can easily be magnetized. The energy dissipated per cycle, thus, for iron is less than for steel.

OC = Coercivity

Suitability of magnetic materials for different purposes can be studied by taking the specimen through a complete cycle and drawing the hysteresis loop. A material with high retentivity and large coercive force would be most suitable to make a permanent magnet. The cores of electromagnets used for alternating currents where the specimen repeatedly undergoes magnetization and demagnetization should have narrow hysteresis curves of small area to minimize the waste of energy.
A bullet train is lifted above the rails due to magnetic effect, thus friction is reduced to minimum and speed can be enhanced up to $500 \mathrm{~kmh}^{2}$.

# SUMMARY

- $\quad$ Crystalline solids are those in which there is a regular arrangement of molecules. The neighbours of every molecule are arranged in a regular pattern that is constant through out the crystal. Thus, there is an ordered structure in crystalline solids.
- In amorphous solids there is no regular arrangement of molecules. These are more like liquids with the disordered structure frozen in.
- Polymers may be said to be more or less solid materials with a structure that is intermediate between order and disorder. These can be classified as partially or poorly crystalline solids.
- A crystalline solid consists of three dimensional pattern that repeats itself over and over again. This basic structure is called unit cell.
- $\quad$ The force applied on unit area to produce any change in the shape, volume or length of a body is called stress.
- When a long wire of length $l$ with area of cross section $A$ is being pulled by a force $F$, which results in an increase in length $\Delta l$, the stress is called tensile deformation.
- When a small cylinder is subjected to a force $F$ along the inward drawn normal to its area of cross section $A$ to reduce its length, the stress is called compressive stress and deformation produced by it is called compressive deformation.
- If a force $F$ is applied tangentially to the surface of the opposite face of a cube to deform or twist it through an angle $\theta$, the stress is termed as shear stress.
- Strain is a measure of the deformation of a solid when stress is applied to it. In the case of deformation in one dimension, strain is defined as the fractional change in length per unit length. If strain is due to tensile stress, it is called tensile strain and if it is produced as a result of compressive stress, it is termed as compressive strain.
- $\quad$ The ratio of stress to strain is a constant for a given material, provided the external applied force is not too great. This is called modulus of elasticity.
- $\quad$ The strain energy can be obtained by the area of the force-extension graph.
- $\quad$ The electrical behaviour of semi-conductor is substantially changed on introducing

a small amount of impurity into the pure semi-conductor lattice. The process is called doping in which a small number of atoms of some other suitable elements are added as impurity. The doped semi-conducting materials are called extrinsic.

- When a silicon crystal is doped with a pentavalent element, four valence electrons of the impurity atom form covalent bond with the neighbouring Si atoms, while the fifth valence electron provides a free electron in the crystal. Such a doped or extrinsic semi-conductor is called n-type semi-conductor.
- There are some materials whose resistivity becomes zero below a certain temperature $T_{c}$, called critical temperature. Below this temperature, such materials are called superconductors.
- Substances in which the orbits and the spin axes of the electrons in an atom are so oriented that their magnetic fields support each other and the atom behaves like a tiny magnet are called paramagnetic substances.
- The substances in which magnetic fields produced by orbital and spin molecules of the electrons add up to zero are called diamagnetic substances.
- Substances in which the atoms co-operate with each other in such a way so as to exhibit a strong magnetic effect are called ferromagnetic.
