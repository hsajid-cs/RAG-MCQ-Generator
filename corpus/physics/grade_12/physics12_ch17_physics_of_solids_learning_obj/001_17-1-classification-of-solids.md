### 17.1 CLASSIFICATION OF SOLIDS

## Crystalline Solids

In crystalline solids there is a regular arrangement of molecules. The neighbours of every molecule are arranged in a regular pattern that is constant throughout the crystal. There is, thus an ordered structure in crystalline solids.

The vast majority of solids, e.g., metals such as copper, iron and zinc, ionic compounds such as sodium chloride, ceramics such as zirconia are crystalline. The arrangement of molecules, atoms or ions within all types of crystalline solids can be studied using various X-ray techniques. It should be noted that atoms, molecules or ions in a crystalline solid are not static. For example, each atom in a metal crystal vibrates about a fixed point with an amplitude that increases with rise in temperature. It is the average atomic positions which are perfectly ordered over large distances.

The cohesive forces between atoms, molecules or ions in crystalline solids maintain the strict long-range order inspite of atomic vibrations. For every crystal, however, there is a temperature at which the vibrations become so great that the structure suddenly breaks up, and the solid melts. The transition from solid (order) to liquid (disorder) is, therefore, abrupt or discontinuous. Every crystalline solid has a definite melting point.

# Amorphous or Glassy Solids

The word amorphous means without form or structure. Thus in amorphous solids there is no regular arrangement of molecules like that in crystalline solids. We can, therefore, say that amorphous solids are more like liquids with the disordered structure frozen in.

For example ordinary glass, which is a solid at ordinary temperature, has no regular arrangement of molecules. On heating, it gradually softens into a paste like state before it becomes a very viscous liquid at almost $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Thus amorphous solids are also called glassy solids. This type of solids have no definite melting point.

## Polymeric Solids

Polymers may be said to be more or less solid materials with a structure that is intermediate between order and disorder. They can be classified as partially or poorly crystalline solids.

Polymers form a large group of naturally occurring and synthetic materials. Plastics and synthetic rubbers are termed 'Ploymers' because they are formed by polymerization reactions in which relatively simple molecules are chemically combined into massive long chain molecules, or "three dimensional" structures. These materials have rather low specific gravity compared with even the lightest of metals, and

yet exhibit good strength-to-weight ratio.
Polymers consist wholly or in part of chemical combinations of carbon with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and other metallic or non-metallic elements. Polythene, polystrene and nylon etc., are examples of polymers. Natural rubber is composed in the pure state entirely of a hydrocarbon with the formula $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{8}\right)_{n}$.

# Crystal Lattice

A crystalline solid consists of three dimensional pattern that repeats itself over and over again. This smallest three dimensional basic structure is called unit cell. The whole structure obtained by the repetition of unit cell is known as crystal lattice. For example, the pattern of NaCl particles have a cube shape. The cube shape of the sodium chloride is just one of several crystal shapes. In a cubic crystal all the sides meet at right angles. Other crystal shapes have corners in which one or more of the angles are not right angles.
