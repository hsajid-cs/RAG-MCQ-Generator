### 14.8 CATHODE RAY OSCILLOSCOPE

Cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) is a very versatile electronic instrument which is, in fact, a high speed graph plotting device. It works by deflecting beam of electrons as they pass through uniform electric field between the two sets of parallel plates as shown in the Fig. 14.13(a). The deflected beam then falls on a fluorescent screen where it makes a visible spot.

It can display graphs of functions which rapidly vary with time. It is called cathode ray oscilloscope because it traces the desired waveform with a beam of electrons which are also called cathode rays.

The beam of the electrons is provided by an electron gun which consists of an indirectly heated cathode, a grid and three anodes. The filament $F$ heats the cathode $C$ which emits electrons. The anodes $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}$ which are at high positive potential with respect to cathode, accelerate as well as focus the electronic beam to fixed spot on the screen $S$. The grid $G$ is at a negative potential with respect to cathode. It controls the number of electrons which are accelerated by anodes, and thus it controls the brightness of the spot formed on the screen.

Now we would explain how the waveform of various voltages is formed in CRO.

The two set of deflecting plates, shown in Fig. 14.13(a) are usually referred as $x$ and $y$ deflection plates because a voltage applied between the $x$ plates deflects the beam horizontally on the screen i.e., parallel to $x$-axis. A voltage applied across the $y$ plates deflects the beam vertically on the screen i.e., along the $y$-axis. The voltage that is applied across the $x$ plates is usually provided by a circuit that is built in the CRO. It is known as sweep or time base generator. Its output waveform is a saw tooth voltage of period $T$ (Fig. 14.13-b). The voltage increases linearly with time for a period $T$ and then drops to zero. As this voltage is impressed across the $x$ plates, the spot is deflected linearly with time along the $x$-axis for a time $T$. Then the spot returns to its starting point on the screen very quickly because a saw tooth voltage rapidly falls to its initial value at the end of each

period. We can actually see the spot moving on the $x$-axis. If the time period $T$ is very short, we see just a bright line on the screen.

If a sinusoidal voltage is applied across the $y$ plates when, simultaneously, the time base voltage is impressed across the $x$ plates, the sinusoidal voltage, which itself gives rise to a vertical line, will now spread out and will appear as a sinusoidal trace on the screen. The pattern will appear stationary only if the time $T$ is equal to or is some multiple of the time of one cycle of the voltage on y plates. It is thus necessary to synchronize the frequency of the time base generator with the frequency of the voltage at the $y$ plates. This is possible by adjusting the synchronization controls provided on the front panel of the CRO.

The CRO is used for displaying the waveform of a given voltage. Once the waveform is displayed, we can measure the voltage, its frequency and phase. For example, Fig. 14.14(a) shows the waveform of an alternating voltage. As the $y$-axis is calibrated in volts and the $x$-axis in time, we can easily find the instantaneous value and peak value of the voltage. The time period can also be determined by using the time calibration of $x$-axis. Information about the phase difference between two voltages can be obtained by simultaneously displaying their waveforms. For example, the waveforms of two voltages are shown in Fig. 14.14(b). These waveforms show that when the voltage of I is increasing, that of II is decreasing and vice versa. Thus the phase difference between these voltages is $180^{\circ}$.
