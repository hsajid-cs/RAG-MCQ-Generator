### 14.11 AVO METER - MULTIMETER

It is an instrument which can measure current ir amperes, potential difference in volts and resistance ir ohms. It basically consists of a sensitive moving coi galvanometer which is converted into a multirange ammeter voltmeter or ohmmeter accordingly as a current measuring

circuit or a voltage measuring circuit or a resistance measuring circuit is connected with the galvanometer with the help of a switch known as function switch (Fig.14.22). Here $X, Y$ are the main terminals of the AVO meter which are connected with the circuit in which measurement is required. FS is the function selector switch which connects the galvanometer with relevant measuring circuit.

# Voltage Measuring Part of AVO Meter

The voltage measuring part of the AVO meter is actually a multirange voltmeter. It consists of a number of resistances each of which can be connected in series with the moving coil galvanometer with the help of a switch called the range switch (Fig. 14.23). The value of each resistance depends upon the range of the voltmeter which it controls.
Alternating voltages are also measured by AVO meter. AC voltage is first converted into DC voltage by using diode as rectifier and then measured as usual.

## Current Measuring Part of AVO Meter

The current measuring part of the AVO meter is actually a multirange ammeter. It consists of a number of low resistances connected in parallel with the galvanometer. The values of these resistances depend upon the range of the ammeter (Fig. 14.24).
The circuit also has a range selection switch RS which is used to select a particular range of the current.

## Resistance Measuring Part of AVO Meter

The resistance measuring part of AVO meter is, in fact, a multirange ohmmeter. Circuit for each range of this meter consists of a battery of emf $V_{s}$ and a variable resistance $r_{s}$ connected in series with galvanometer of resistance $R_{0}$. When the function switch is switched to position $X_{1}$ Fig. 14.22), this circuit is connected with the terminals $X, Y$ of he AVO meter (Fig. 14.25 a).
Before measuring an unknown resistance by an ohmmeter it s first zeroed which means that we short circuit the terminals $\langle, Y$ and adjust $r_{s}$, to produce full scale deflection.

## Digital Multimeter (DMM)

Another useful device to measure resistance, current and voltage is an electronic instrument called digital multimeter.

It is a digital version of an AVO meter. It has become a very popular testing device because the digital values are displayed automatically with decimal point, polarity and the unit for $V, A$ or $\Omega$. These meters are generally easier to use because they eliminate the human error that often occurs in reading the dial of an ordinary AVO meter. A portable DMM is shown in Fig. 14.26.

# SUMMARY

A magnetic field is set up in the region surrounding a current carrying conductor.
The right hand rule states, "If the wire is grasped in the fist of right hand with the thumb pointing in the direction of current, the fingers of the hand will circle the wire in the direction of the magnetic field".
The strength of the magnetic field or magnetic induction is the force acting on one metre length of the conductor placed at right angle to the magnetic field when 1 A current is passing through it.
A magnetic field is said to have a strength of one tesla if it exerts a force of one newton on one metre length of the conductor placed at right angle to the field when a current of one ampere passes through the conductor.
The magnetic flux $\Phi_{0}$ through plane element of area $\mathbf{A}$ in a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ is given by dot product of $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{A}$.
Ampere circuital law states the sum of the quantities B. $\Delta \mathbf{L}$ for all path elements into which the complete loop has been divided equals $\mu_{0}$ times the total current enclosed by the loop.
The force experienced by a single charge carrier moving with velocity $\mathbf{v}$ in magnetic field of strength $\mathbf{B}$ is $\mathbf{F}=q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})$.
Cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) is a high speed graph plotting device. It works by deflecting beam of electrons as they pass through uniform electric field between the two sets of parallel plates.
A torque may act on a current carrying coil placed in a magnetic field.

A galvanometer is an electric device which detects the flow of current. It usually consists of a coil placed in a magnetic field. As the current passes through the coil, the coil rotates, thus indicating the flow of current.
A galvanometer is converted into an ammeter by properly shunting it.
A galvanometer is converted into a voltmeter by connecting a high resistance in series.
