### 14.2 FORCE ON A CURRENT CARRYING CONDUCTOR IN A UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD

We have seen that a current carrying conductor sets up its own magnetic field. If such a conductor is placed in an external magnetic field, the magnetic field of the conductor will interact with the external magnetic field, as a result of which the conductor may experience a force. To demonstrate

When a current is passed through the copper rod from a battery, the rod moves on the rails. The relative directions of the current, magnetic field and the motion of the conductor are shown in Fig. 14.3. It can be seen that the force on a conductor is always at right angles to the plane which contains the rod and the direction of the magnetic field. The magnitude of the force depends upon the following factors:
(i) The force $F$ is directly proportional to $\sin \alpha$ where $\alpha$ is the angle between the conductor and the field. From this, it follows that the force is zero if the rod is placed parallel to the field and is maximum when the conductor is placed at right angles to the field.

$$
F \propto \sin \alpha
$$

(ii) The force $F$ is directly proportional to the current $I$ flowing through the conductor. The more the current, greater is the force.

$$
F \propto I
$$

(iii) The force $F$ is directly proportional to the length $L$ of the conductor inside the magnetic field.

$$
F \propto L
$$

(iv) The force $F$ is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. The stronger the field, the greater is the force. If we represent the strength of the field by $B$, then

$$
F \propto B
$$

Combining all these factors,

$$
F \propto I L B \sin \alpha
$$

or

$$
F=k / L B \sin \alpha
$$

where $k$ is constant of proportionality. If we follow SI units, the value of $k$ is 1 . Thus in SI units

$$
F=I L B \sin \alpha
$$

Eq.14.1 provides a definition for the strength of magnetic field. If $I=1 \mathrm{~A}, L=1 \mathrm{~m}$ and $\alpha=90^{\circ}$, then $F=B$. Thus $B$, the strength of magnetic field which is also known as magnetic induction is defined as the force acting on one metre length of the conductor placed at right angle to the magnetic field when 1 A current is passing through it. In SI units the unit of $B$ is tesla. A magnetic field is said to have a strength of one tesla if it exerts a force of one newton on one metre length of the conductor placed at right angles to the field when a current of one ampere passes through the conductor. Thus

$$
1 \mathrm{~T}=1 \mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}
$$

It can be seen that the force on a current carrying conductor is given both in magnitude and direction by the following equation:

$$
F=I L \times B
$$

where the vector $L$ is in the direction of current flow. The magnitude of the vector $/ \mathrm{L} \times \mathrm{B}$ is $/ L B \sin \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the angle between the vector $L$ and $B$. This gives the magnitude of the force. The direction of the force $F$ (Fig. 14.3) is also correctly given by the right hand rule of the cross product of vectors of $L$ and $B$ i.e., rotate $L$ to coincide with $B$ through the smaller angle. Curl the fingers of right hand in the direction of rotation. The thumb points in the direction of force. In some situations the direction of the force is conveniently determined by applying the following rule:
Consider a straight current carrying conductor held at right angle to a magnetic field such that the current flows out of the plane of paper i.e., towards the reader as shown in Fig. 14.4. It is customary to represent a current flowing towards the reader by a symbol dot $(\bullet)$ and a current flowing away from him by a cross ( $x$ ).
In order to find the direction of force, consider the lines of force (Fig. 14.4). The two fields tend to reinforce each other on left hand side of the conductor and cancel each other on the right side of it. The conductor tends to move towards the weaker part of the field i.e., the force on the conductor will be directed towards right in a direction at right angles to both the

conductor and the magnetic field. This rule is often referred as extension of right hand rule. It can be seen that the direction of the force is the same as given by the direction of the vector $L \times B$.

Example 14.1: A 20.0 cm wire carrying a current of 10.0 A is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.30 T . If the wire makes an angle of $40^{\circ}$ with the direction of magnetic field, find the magnitude of the force acting on the wire.

# Solution:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Length of the wire }=L=20.0 \mathrm{~cm}=0.20 \mathrm{~m} \\
\text { Current }=1=10.0 \mathrm{~A} \\
\text { Strength of magnetic field }=B=0.30 \mathrm{~T} \\
\text { Angle }=\alpha=40^{\circ}
\end{gathered}
$$

Substituting these values in the equation

$$
\begin{gathered}
F=1 B L \sin \alpha \\
F=10.0 \mathrm{~A} \times 0.30 \mathrm{~T} \times 0.20 \mathrm{~m} \times \sin 40^{\circ}=0.39 \mathrm{~N}
\end{gathered}
