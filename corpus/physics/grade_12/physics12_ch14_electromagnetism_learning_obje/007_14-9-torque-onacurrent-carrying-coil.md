### 14.9 TORQUE ONACURRENT CARRYING COIL

Consider a rectangular coil carrying a current $I$. The coil is capable of rotation about an axis. Suppose it is placed in uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ with its plane along the field (Fig. 14.15). We know that a current carrying conductor of length $L$ when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force $F=I L B$ sin $\theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between conductor and the field. In case of sides $A B$ and $C D$ of the coil, the angle $\theta$ is zero or $180^{\circ}$, so the force on these sides will be zero. In case of sides $D A$ and $B C$, the angle $\theta$ is $90^{\circ}$ and the force on these sides will be

$$
F_{1}=F_{2}=I L B
$$

where $L$ is the length of these sides, $F_{1}$ is the force on the side $D A$ and $F_{2}$ on $B C$. The direction of the force is given by the vector $/ \mathbf{L} \times \mathbf{B}$. It can be seen that $F_{1}$ is directed out of the plane of paper and $F_{2}$ into the plane of paper (Fig. 14.15 a). Therefore, the forces $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ being equal and opposite form a couple which tends to rotate it about the axis. The torque of this couple is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau & =\text { Force } \times \text { Momentarm } \\
& =I L B \times a
\end{aligned}
$$

where $a$ is the moment arm of the couple and is equal to the length of the side $A B$ or $C D$. La is the area $A$ of the coil,

$$
\tau=I B A
$$

Note that the Eq. 14.15 gives the value of torque when the field $B$ is in the plane of the coil. However if the field makes an angle $\alpha$ with the plane of the coil, as shown in Fig 14.15(b), the moment arm now becomes a $\cos \alpha$. So

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \tau=I L B \times \operatorname{acos} \alpha \\
& \tau=I B A \cos \alpha
\end{aligned}
$$

# 14.10 GALVANOMETER

A galvanometer is an electrical instrument used to detect the passage of current. Its working depends upon the fact that when a conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experience a force as soon as a current passes through it. Due to this force, a torque $\tau$ acts upon the conductor if it is in the form of a coil or loop.

$$
\tau=N / B A \cos \alpha
$$

where $N$ is the number of turns in the coil, $A$ is its area, $I$ is current passing through it, $B$ is the magnetic field in which the coil is placed such that its plane makes an angle a with the direction of $\mathbf{B}$. Due to action of the torque, the coil rotates and

thus it detects the current. The construction of a moving coil galvanometer is shown in Fig. 14.16 (a).
A rectangular coil $C$ is suspended between the concave shaped poles $N$ and $S$ of a $U$-shaped magnet with the help of a fine metallic suspension wire. The rectangular coil is made of enameled copper wire. It is wound on a frame of nonmagnetic material. The suspension wire $F$ is also used as one current lead to the coil. The other terminal of the coil is connected to a loosely wound spiral $E$ which serves as the second current lead. A soft iron cylinder D is placed inside the coil to make the field radial and stronger near the coil as shown in Fig. 14.16 (b).
When a current is passed through the coil, it is acted upon by a couple which tends to rotate the coil. This couple is known as deflecting couple and is given by $N / B A \cos \alpha$. As the coil is placed in a radial magnetic field in which the plane of the coil is always parallel to the field (Fig. 14.16 b), so $\alpha$ is always zero. This makes $\cos \alpha=1$ and thus,

$$
\text { Deflecting couple }=N i B A
$$

As the coil turns under the action of deflecting couple, the suspension wire Fig. (14.16 a) is twisted which gives rise to a torsional couple. It tends to untwist the suspension and restore the coil to its original position. This couple is known as restoring couple. The restoring couple of the suspension wire is proportional to the angle of deflection $\theta$ as long as the suspension wire obeys Hooke's law. Thus

$$
\text { Restoring torque }=c \theta
$$

where the constant c of the suspension wire is known as torsional couple and is defined as couple for unit twist.
Under the effect of these two couples, coil comes to rest when Deflecting torque $=$ Restoring torque

$$
\begin{aligned}
& N I B A=c \theta \\
& \text { or } \\
& 1=\frac{c}{B A N} \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $\quad 1 \propto \theta \quad$ since $\quad \frac{c}{B A N}=$ Constant
Thus the current passing through the coil is directly proportional to the angle of deflection.

There are two methods commonly used for observing the angle of deflection of the coil. In sensitive galvanometers the angle of deflection is observed by means of small mirror attached to the coil along with a lamp and scale arrangement (Fig.14.17). A beam of light from the lamp is directed towards the mirror of the galvanometer. After reflection from the mirror it produces a spot on a translucent scale placed at a distance of one metre from the galvanometer. When the coil rotates, the mirror attached to coil also rotates and spot of light moves along the scale. The displacement of the spot of light on the scale is proportional to the angle of deflection (provided the angle of deflection is small).
The galvanometer used in school and college laboratories is a pivoted type galvanometer. In this type of galvanometer, the coil is pivoted between two jewelled bearings. The restoring torque is provided by two hair springs which also serve as current leads. A light aluminium pointer is attached to the coil which moves over a scale (Fig.14.18). It gives the angle of deflection of the coil.
It is obvious from Eq. 14.17 that a galvanometer can be made more sensitive (to give large deflection for a given current) if $\mathrm{c} / B A N$ is made small. Thus, to increase sensitivity of a galvanometer, c may be decreased or $B, A$ and $N$ may be increased. The couple $c$ for unit twist of the suspension wire can be decreased by increasing its length and by decreasing its diameter. This process, however, cannot be taken too far, as the suspension must be strong enough to support the coil. Another method to increase the sensitivity of galvanometer is to increase N , the number of turns of the coil. In case of suspended coil type galvanometer, the number of turns can not be increased beyond a limit because it will make the coil heavy. To compensate for the loss of sensitivity, in case fewer turns are used in the coil, we increase the value of the magnetic field employed. We define current sensitivity of a galvanometer as the current, in microamperes, required to produce one millimetre deflection on a scale placed one metre away from the mirror of the galvanometer.
When the current passing through the galvanometer is discontinued, the coil will not come to rest as soon as the current flowing through the coil is stopped. It keeps on oscillating about its mean position before coming to rest. In the same way if the current is established suddenly in a galvanometer, the coil will shoot beyond its final equilibrium position and will oscillate several times before coming to rest

at its equilibrium position. As it is annoying and time consuming to wait for the coil to come to rest, artificial ways are employed to make the coil come to rest quickly. Such galvanometer in which the coil comes to rest quickly after the current passed through it or the current is stopped from flowing through it, is called stable or a dead beat galvanometer.

## Ammeter

An ammeter is an electrical instrument which is used to measure current in amperes. This is basically a galvanometer. The portion of the galvanometer whose motion causes the needle of the device to move across the scale is usually known as meter - movement. Most meter movements are very sensitive and full scale deflection is obtained with a current of few milliamperes only. So an ordinary galvanometer cannot be used for measuring large currents without proper modification.
Suppose we have a galvanometer whose meter - movement (coil) has a resistance $R_{s}$ and which gives full scale deflection when current $I_{n}$ is passed through it. From Ohm's law we know that the potential difference $V_{0}$ which causes a current $I_{0}$ to pass through the galvanometer is given by

$$
V_{0}=I_{0} R_{0}
$$

If we want to convert this galvanometer into an ammeter which can measure a maximum current $I$, it is necessary to connect a low value bypass resistor called shunt. The shunt resistance is of such a value so that the current $I_{0}$ for full scale deflection of the galvanometer passes through the galvanometer and the remaining current $\left(I-I_{0}\right)$ passes through the shunt in this situation (Fig. 14.19).
The shunt resistance $R_{s}$ can be calculated from the fact that as the meter - movement and the shunt are connected in parallel with each other, the potential difference across the meter - movement is equal to the potential difference across the shunt.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& I_{0} R_{0}=\left(I-I_{0}\right) R_{n} \\
& R_{s}=\frac{I_{0}}{I-I_{0}} R_{0}
\end{aligned}
$$

The resistance of the shunt is usually so small that a piece of

copper wire serves the purpose. The resistance of the ammeter is the combined resistance of the galvanometer's meter - movement and the shunt. Usually it is very small. An ammeter must have a very low resistance so that it does not disturb the circuit in which it is connected in series in order to measure the current.

# Voltmeter

A voltmeter is an electrical device which measures the potential difference in volts between two points. This, too, is made by modifying a galvanometer. Since a voltmeter is always connected in parallel, it must have a very high resistance so that it will not short the circuit across which the voltage is to be measured. This is achieved by connecting a very high resistance $R_{h}$ placed in series with the meter movement (Fig.14.20). Suppose we have a meter movement whose resistance is $R_{g}$ and which deflects full scale with a current $I_{s}$. In order to make a voltmeter from it which has a range of $V$ volts, the value of the high resistance $R_{h}$ should be such that full scale deflection will be obtained when it is connected across $V$ volt. Under this condition the current through the meter - movement is $I_{s}$. Applying Ohm's law (Fig.14.20) we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V=I_{s}\left(R_{s}+R_{h}\right) \\
& R_{h}=\frac{V}{I_{g}}-R_{g}
\end{aligned}
$$

If the scale of the galvanometer is calibrated from 0 to $V$ volts, the combination of galvanometer and the series resistor acts as a voltmeter with range $0-V$ volts. By properly arranging the resistance $R_{h}$ any voltage can be measured. Thus, we see that a voltmeter possesses high resistance.
It may be noted that a voltmeter is always connected across the two points between which potential difference is to be measured. Before connecting a voltmeter, it should be assured that its resistance is very high in comparison with the resistance of the circuit across which it is connected otherwise it will load the circuit and will alter the potential difference which is required to be measured.
Example 14.6: What shunt resistance must be connected across a galvanometer of $50.0 \Omega$ resistance which gives full scale deflection with 2.0 mA current, so as to convert it into an ammeter of range 10.0A?

## Solution:

Resistance of galvanometer $=R_{s}=50.0 \Omega$
Current for full scale deflection $=I_{0}=2.0 \mathrm{~mA}$
Current to be measured $\quad=I=10.0 \mathrm{~A}$
The shunt resistance $R_{s}$ is given by

$$
R_{s}=\frac{I_{0}}{I-I_{0}} R_{p}=\frac{2.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~A}}{10.0 \mathrm{~A}-2.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~A}} \times 50.0 \mathrm{~A}=0.01 \Omega
$$

# Ohmmeter

It is a useful device for rapid measurement of resistance. It consists of a galvanometer, and adjustable resistance $r_{s}$ and a cell connected in series (Fig.14.21-a). The series resistance $r_{s}$ is so adjusted that when terminals $c$ and $d$ are short circuited, i.e., when $R=0$, the galvanometer gives full scale deflection. So the extreme graduation of the usual scale of the galvanometer is marked 0 for resistance measurement. When terminals $c$ and $d$ are not joined, no current passes through the galvanometer and its deflection is zero. Thus zero of the scale is marked as infinity (Fig. 14.21-b). Now a known resistance $R$ is connected across the terminals c and d . The galvanometer deflects to some intermediate point. This point is calibrated as R. In this way the whole scale is calibrated into resistance. The resistance to be measured is connected across the terminals c and d. The deflection on the calibrated scale reads the value of the resistance directly.
