### 14.7 DETERMINATION OF e/m OF AN ELECTRON

Let a narrow beam of electrons moving with a constant speed $v$ be projected at right angles to a known uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ directed into plane of paper. We have seen that electrons will experience a force

$$
F=-e \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}
$$

The direction of the force will be perpendicular to both $\mathbf{v}$ and B. As the electron is experiencing a force that acts at right angle to its velocity, so it will change the direction of the velocity. The magnitude of velocity will remain unchanged. The magnitude of the force is evBsin $\theta$. As $\theta$ is $90^{\circ}$, so $F=e v B$. As both $v$ and $B$ do not change, the magnitude of $F$ is constant. Thus the electrons are subjected to a constant force evB at right angle to their direction of motion. Under the action of this force, the electrons will move along a circle as shown in Fig. 14.11.
The magnetic force $F=B e v$ provides the necessary centripetal force $\frac{m v^{2}}{r}$ to the electron of mass $m$ to move along a circular trajectory of radius $r$. Thus we have

$$
B e v=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}
$$

or

$$
\frac{e}{m}=\frac{v}{B r}
$$

If $v$ and $r$ are known, $e / m$ of the electron is determined. The radius $r$ is measured by making the electronic trajectory visible. This is done by filling a glass tube with a gas such as hydrogen at low pressure. This tube is placed in a region occupied by a uniform magnetic field of known value. As electrons are shot into this tube, they begin to move along a circle under the action of magnetic force. As the electrons move, they collide with atoms of the gas. This excites the atoms due to which they emit light and their path becomes visible as a circular ring of light (Fig. 14.12). The diameter of the ring can be easily measured.
In order to measure the velocity $v$ of the electrons, we should know the potential difference through which the electrons are accelerated before entering into the magnetic field. If $V$ is this potential difference, the energy gained by electrons during their acceleration is Ve. This appears as the kinetic energy of electrons
or

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} & =\text { Ve } \\
v & =\sqrt{\frac{2 \mathrm{Ve}}{m}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting the value of $v$ in Eq. 14.13, we have

$$
\frac{e}{m}=\frac{2 V}{B^{2} r^{2}}
$$

Fig 14.11 An electron is moving perpendicular to a constant magnetic field. The magnetic force $F$ causes the particle to move on a circular path.

Example 14.4: Find the radius of an orbit of an electron moving at a rate of $2.0 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ in a uniform magnetic field of $1.20 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~T}$.

# Solution:

| Speed of the electron | $=v=2.0 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| Magnetic field strength | $=B=1.20 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~T}$ |
| Mass of the electron | $=m=9.11 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg}$ |
| Charge on electron | $=e=1.61 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$ |

The radius of the orbit is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& r=\frac{m v}{e B} \\
& =\frac{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg} \times 2.0 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{1.61 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C} \times 1.20 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~T}} \\
& r=9.43 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 14.5: Alpha particles ranging in speed from $1000 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ to $2000 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ enter into a velocity selector where the electric intensity is $300 \mathrm{Vm}^{-1}$ and the magnetic induction 0.20 T . Which particle will move undeviated through the field?

## Solution:

$$
E=300 \mathrm{Vm}^{-1}=300 \mathrm{NC}^{-1} \quad, \quad B=0.20 \mathrm{~T}
$$

Only those particles will be able to pass through the plate for which the electric force $e E$ acting on the particles balances the magnetic force Bev on the particle as shown in the figure. Therefore

$$
e E=B e v
$$

Thus, the selected speed is

$$
v=\frac{E}{B}=\frac{300 \mathrm{NC}^{-1}}{0.20 \mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}}=1500 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
$$

The alpha particles having a speed of $1500 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ will move undeviated through the field.
