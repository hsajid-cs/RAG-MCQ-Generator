### 14.3 MAGNETIC FLUX AND FLUX DENSITY

Like electric flux, the magnetic flux $\Phi_{B}$ through a plane element of area $\mathbf{A}$ in a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ is given by dot product of $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ (Fig. 14.5).

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Phi_{B}=\mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{A} \\
& \Phi_{B}=B A \cos \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that $\mathbf{A}$ is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the element and whose direction is along the normal to the surface of the element, $\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the vectors $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{A}$.

In Fig. 14.5 (b) the field is directed along the normal to the area, so $\theta$ is zero and the flux is maximum, equal to $B A$. When the field is parallel to the plane of the area (Fig. 14.5 c), the angle between the field and normal to area is $90^{\circ}$ i.e., $\theta=90^{\circ}$, so the flux through the area in this position is zero.

In case of a curved surface placed in a non uniform magnetic field, the curved surface is divided into a number of small surface elements, each element being assumed plane and the flux through the whole curved surface is calculated by sum of the contributions from all the elements of the surface. From the definition of tesla, the unit of magnetic flux is $\mathrm{NmA}^{-1}$ which is called weber (Wb).

According to Eq.14.3, the magnetic induction $\mathbf{B}$ is the flux per unit area of a surface perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$, hence it is also called as flux density. Its unit is then, $\mathrm{Wbm}^{2}$. Therefore, magnetic induction, i.e., the magnetic field strength is measured in terms of $\mathrm{Wbm}^{2}$ or $\mathrm{NA}^{\circ} \mathrm{m}^{\circ}$ (tesla).
Example 14.2: The magnetic field in a certain region is given by $\mathbf{B}=(40 \hat{\mathrm{i}}-18 \hat{\mathrm{k}}) \mathrm{Wbm}^{2}$. How much flux passes through a $5.0 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ area loop in this region if the loop lies flat in the xy- plane?

# Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Magnetic induction } & =\mathbf{B}=40 \hat{\mathrm{i}}-18 \hat{\mathrm{k}} \\
\text { Area of the loop } & =\Delta \mathbf{A}=5.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \hat{\mathrm{k}} \\
\text { Flux } & =\Phi_{0}=\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{A} \\
& =(40 \hat{\mathrm{i}}-18 \hat{\mathrm{k}}) \cdot\left(5.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \hat{\mathrm{k}}\right) \\
\Phi_{0} & =90 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~Wb}
\end{aligned}
