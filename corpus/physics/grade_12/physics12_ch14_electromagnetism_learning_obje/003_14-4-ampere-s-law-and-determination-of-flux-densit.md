### 14.4 AMPERE'S LAW AND DETERMINATION OF FLUX DENSITY B

We know that an electric current produces a magnetic field. Ampere, after carrying out a series of experiments, generalized his results into a law known as Ampere circuital law by which the magnetic flux density $\mathbf{B}$ at any point due to a current carrying conductor can be easily computed as explained below:
Consider a closed path in the form a circle of radius $r$ enclosing the current carrying wire (Fig.14.6). This closed path is referred as Amperean path. Divide this path into small elements of length like $\Delta \mathrm{L}$. Let $\mathbf{B}$ be the value of flux density at the site of $\Delta \mathrm{L}$. Determine the value of $\mathbf{B} . \Delta \mathrm{L}$. If $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{B}$ and $\Delta \mathbf{L}$, then

$$
\mathbf{B} . \Delta \mathbf{L}=B \Delta L \cos \theta
$$

$B \cos \theta$ represents the component of $\mathbf{B}$ along the element of length $\Delta \mathbf{L}$ i.e., Component of $\mathbf{B}$ parallel to $\Delta \mathbf{L}$. Thus $\mathbf{B} . \Delta \mathbf{L}$ represents the product of the length of the element $\Delta \mathbf{L}$ and the component of $\mathbf{B}$ parallel to $\Delta \mathbf{L}$. Ampere stated that the sum of the quantities $\mathbf{B} . \Delta \mathbf{L}$ for all path elements into which the complete loop has been divided equals $\mu_{0}$ times the total current enclosed by the loop, where $\mu_{0}$ is a constant, known

as permeability of free space. In SI units its value is $4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~WbA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$. This can be mathematically expressed as

$$
(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{1}+(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{2}+\ldots .+(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{1}+\ldots .+(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{N}=\mu_{0} /
$$

or

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{i}=\mu_{0} /
$$

where ( $\mathbf{B} . \Delta \mathbf{L}$ ), is the value of $\mathbf{B} . \Delta \mathbf{L}$ along the $r$ th element and N is the total number of elements into which the loop has been divided. This is known as Ampere's circuital law.

# Field Due to a Current Carrying Solenoid

A solenoid is a long, tightly wound, cylindrical coil of wire. When current passes through such a coil, it behaves like a bar magnet. The magnetic field produced by it is shown in Fig. 14.7(a). The field inside a long solenoid is uniform and much strong whereas out side the solenoid, it is so weak that it can be neglected as compared to the field inside.
The value of magnetic filed $\mathbf{B}$ can be easily determined by applying Ampere's circuital law. Consider a rectangular loop abcd as shown in Fig. 14.7 (b). Divide it into four elements of length $a b=\ell_{1}, b c=\ell_{2}, c d=\ell_{3}$ and $d a=\ell_{4}$.
Fig. 14.7
Applying Ampere's law, we have

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{4}(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{i}=\mu_{0} \times \text { current enclosed }
$$

$(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{1}+(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{2}+(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{3}+(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{4}=\mu_{0} \times$ current enclosed
Now we will calculate the value of $\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L}$ for each of the elements. First we will consider the element $a b=\ell_{1}$ that lies inside the solenoid. Field inside the solenoid is uniform and is parallel to (Fig. 14.7b), so

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{1} & =\ell_{1} B \cos 0^{\circ} \\
& =\ell_{1} B
\end{aligned}
$$

For the element $\mathrm{cd}=\ell_{3}$, that lies outside the solenoid, the field $\mathbf{B}$ is zero, so

$$
(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{2}=0
$$

Again $\mathbf{B}$ is perpendicular to $\ell_{2}$ and $\ell_{4}$ inside the solenoid and is zero outside, so

$$
\begin{gathered}
(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{2}=(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{2}=0 \\
\sum_{r=1}^{4}(\mathbf{B} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{L})_{r}=B \ell_{1}=\mu_{0} \times \text { current enclosed }
\end{gathered}
$$

To find the current enclosed, consider the rectangular surface bounded by the loop abcda.
If $n$ is the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid, the rectangular surface will intercept $n \ell$, turns, each carrying a current $I$. So the current enclosed by the loop is $n \ell_{1} I$. Thus Ampere's law gives

$$
B \ell_{1}=\mu_{0} \times n \ell_{1} I
$$

or

$$
B=\mu_{0} n I
$$

The field $\mathbf{B}$ is along the axis of the solenoid and its direction is given by right hand grip rule which states "hold the solenoid in the right hand with fingers curling in the direction of the current, the thumb will point in the direction of the field".

Example 14.3: A solenoid 15.0 cm long has 300 turns of wire. A current of 5.0 A flows through it. What is the magnitude of magnetic field inside the solenoid?

## Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Length of the solenoid }=L=15.0 \mathrm{~cm}=0.15 \mathrm{~m} \\
& \text { Total number of turns }=\mathrm{N}=300 \\
& \text { Current }=I=5.0 \mathrm{~A} \\
& \text { Permeability of free space }=\mu_{0}=4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~WbA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1} \\
& \text { Number of turns per unit length }=n=\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\ell}=\frac{300}{0.15 \mathrm{~m}} \\
& =2000 \text { turns } / \mathrm{m} \\
& \text { Magnetic field }=B=\mu_{0} n I
\end{aligned}
$$

## The current loop can be imagined to be a phantom bar magnet with a north pole and a south pole.

## (b) Repulsion

The "phantom" magnet included for each loop helps to explain the attraction and repulsion between the loops.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =4 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~WbA}^{\prime} \mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime} \times 2000 \mathrm{~m}^{\prime \prime} \times 5.0 \mathrm{~A} \\
& \mathrm{~B}=1.3 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{Wbm}^{\prime \prime}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 14.5 FORCE ON A MOVING CHARGEINA MAGNETIC FIELD

We have seen that a current carrying conductor, when placed in a magnetic field, experiences a force. The current through the conductor is because of the motion of charges. Actually the magnetic field exerts force on these moving charges due to which the conductor experiences force. We are interested in calculating the force exerted on the moving charges.
Fig. 14.8

## The moving charge experiences a magnetic force $F$ because of the magnetic field $B$.

Consider the situation as shown in Fig. 14.8 where we see a portion of the wire that is carrying a current $I$. Suppose there are $n$ charge carriers per unit volume of the wire, and that each is moving with velocity $v$ as shown. We will now find how long it takes for all the charge carriers originally in the wire segment shown to exit through the end area $\mathbf{A}$.
The volume of the wire segment is $A L$. Because there are $n$ charge carriers per unit volume, the number of charge carrier in the segment is $n A L$. If the charge on a charge carrier is $q$, each of it, as it crosses the end area, will transport a charge $q$ through it. Assuming the speed of the carriers to be $v$, the carrier entering the left face of the segment takes a time $\Delta t=L / v$ to reach the right hand face. During this time, all the charge carriers originally in the segment, namely $n A L$, will exit through the right hand face. As each charge carrier has a charge $q$, the charge $\Delta Q$ that exits through the end area in time $\Delta t=L / v$ is

$$
\Delta Q=n A L q
$$

Then, from the definition of the current, the current / through the conductor is

$$
\begin{aligned}
I & =\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=\frac{n A L q}{L / v} \\
& =n A q v
\end{aligned}
$$

By Eq.14.2, the force on the segment $L$ of a conductor, carrying current / is given by

$$
F_{1}=/ L \times B
$$

Substituting the value of the current /,

$$
F_{1}=n A q v L \times B
$$

In Fig.14.8, it can be seen that the direction of the segment $L$ is the same as the direction of the velocity of the charge carriers. If $L$ is a unit vector along the direction of the segment $L$ and $\hat{v}$, a unit vector along the velocity vector $v$, then $\hat{L}=\hat{v}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
v L & =v \hat{L} L \\
& =v \hat{v} L=v L
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting the value of $v \mathbf{L}$ in Eq.14.7, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{L} & =n A q(v L) \times B \\
& =n A L q v \times B
\end{aligned}
$$

$n A L$ is the total number of charge carries in the segment $L$, so the force experienced by a single charge carrier is

$$
F=\frac{F_{L}}{n A L}=q v \times B
$$

Thus the force experienced by a single charge carrier moving with velocity $v$ in magnetic field of strength $B$ is

$$
F=q(v \times B)
$$

Although the Eq.14.8 has been derived with reference to charge carrier moving in a conductor but it does not involve any parameter of the conductor, so the Eq. 14.8 is quite general and it holds for any charge carrier moving in a magnetic field.
If an electron is projected in a magnetic field with a velocity $v$, it will experience a force which is given by putting $q=-e$ in Eq. 14.8 where $e$ is the magnitude of the electronic charge.

$$
\therefore \quad \mathbf{F}=-e \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}
$$

In case of proton, $F$ is obtained by putting $q=+e$.

$$
\therefore \quad \mathbf{F}=+e \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}
$$

Note that in case of proton or a positive charge the direction of the force is given by the direction of the vector $\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}$ i.e., rotate $\mathbf{v}$ to coincide with $\mathbf{B}$ through the smaller angle of rotation and curl the fingers of right hand in the direction of rotation. Thumb will point in the direction of the force. This is illustrated in Fig. 14.9 in which the proton enters into a magnetic field, as shown in figure, along the direction of dotted line. It experiences a force in the upward direction as given by the vector $\mathbf{v} \times \boldsymbol{B}$. As a result of this force the proton is deflected upwards as shown in Fig. 14.9. The direction of the force on a moving negative charge will be opposite to that of positive charge. Due to this force, the electron is deflected in the downward direction as it enters into a magnetic field. It
Magnetic force $F$ is perpendicular to both the magnetic field $B$ and the velocity $v$ and causes the particle's trajectory to bend in a vertical plane.

Fig. 14.10

## the electric force $F$ that acts on a positive charge is parallel to the electric field $E$ and causes the particle's trajectory to bend in a norizontal plane.
may be noted that the magnitude of the force on a moving charge carrier is $q v B \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the velocity of the carrier and the magnetic field. It is maximum when $\theta=90^{\circ}$ i.e., when the charged particle is projected at right angles to the field. It is zero when $\theta=0^{\circ}$ i.e., a charged particle projected in the direction of the field experiences no force.
