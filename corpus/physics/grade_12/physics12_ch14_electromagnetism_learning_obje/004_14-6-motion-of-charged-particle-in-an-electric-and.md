### 14.6 MOTION OF CHARGED PARTICLE IN AN ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELD

When an electric charge $q$ is placed in an electric field $\mathbf{E}$, It experiences a force $\mathbf{F}$ parallel to electric field (Fig. 14.10). It is given by

$$
F=q E
$$

If the charge is free to move, then it will accelerate according to Newton's second law as

$$
a=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{q E}{m}
$$

If electric field is uniform, then acceleration is also uniform and hence, the position of the particle at any instant of time can be found by using equations of uniformly accelerated motion.
When a charge particle $q$ is moving with velocity $v$ in a region where there is an electric field $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, the total force $\mathbf{F}$ is the vector sum of the electric force $q \mathbf{E}$ and magnetic force $q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})$ that is,

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}_{\mathbf{x}}+\mathbf{F}_{\mathbf{b}} \\
\mathbf{F}=q \mathbf{E}+q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
\end{gathered}
$$

This force $\mathbf{F}$ is known as the Lorentz force. It is to be pointed out that only the electric force does work, while no work is done by the magnetic force which is simply a deflecting force.
