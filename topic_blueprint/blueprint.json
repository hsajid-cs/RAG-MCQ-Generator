It provides the basic principles and laws which help to understand the mysteries of other branches of sciences such as astronomy, chemistry, geology, biology and health sciences. The tools, techniques and products of Physics have transformed our dreams into realities. The comforts and pleasures added in our lives are fruitful results of science, technology and engineering in everyday life.\nThe information technology has entirely changed the outlook of mankind. The fast means of communication have brought people of the entire world in so close contact that the whole world has become a global village.\nComputer chips are made from silicon, which is obtained from sand. It is up to us whether we make a sand castle or a computer out of it.\n\nPhysics is an experimental science and the scientific method emphasizes the need of accurate measurement of various measurable physical quantities. This chapter stresses in understanding the concept of measuring techniques and recording skills.\n\n# 1.1 PHYSICAL QUANTITIESAND THEIR UNITS\n\nThe foundation of physics depends on physical quantities in terms of which the laws of Physics are expressed. Therefore, these quantities have to be measured accurately. These are mass, length, time, velocity, force, density, temperature, electric current, and numerous others.\nPhysical quantities are often divided into two categories: base quantities and derived quantities. Derived quantities are those which depend on base quantities. Examples of derived quantities are velocity, acceleration, force, etc. Base quantities are not defined in terms of other physical quantities. The base quantities are the independent physical quantities in terms of which the other physical quantities can be defined. Typical examples of base quantities are length, mass and time.\nThe measurement of a base quantity involves two steps: first, the choice of a standard, and second, the establishment of a procedure for comparing the quantity to be measured with the standard so that a number and a unit are determined as the measure of that quantity.\nMeasurements must be reliable and accurate so that they can be used, easily and effectively.\n\n### 1.2 INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS\n\nIn 1960, an international committee agreed on a set of definitions and standards to describe the physical quantities. The system that was established is called the System International (SI).\nSI units are used by the world's scientific community and by almost all nations. The system International (SI) consists of two kinds of units: base units and derived units.\n\n## Base Units\n\nThere are seven base units for physical quantities namely: length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, light or luminous intensity and amount of substance (with special reference to the number of particles). Prefixes such as milli, micro, kilo, etc. may be used with them to express smaller or larger quantities.\n\nTable 1.1\n\n| Physical <br> Quantity | SI Unit | Symbol |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Length | mste | m |\n| Mass | kilogram | kg |\n| Time | second | s |\n| Electric <br> current | ampere | A |\n| Thermodynamic <br> temperature | kelvin | K |\n| Intensity of <br> light | candela | cd |\n| Amount of <br> substance | mole | mol |\n\nThe names of base units for these physical quantities together with symbols are listed in Table 1.1.\n\n# Derived Units\n\nDerived units are those units which depend on the base units. Some of the derived units are given in Table. 1.2. The units of plane angle and solid angle have also been included in the list of derived units since 1995.\nIn addition to base and derived units, the SI permits the use of certain additional units, including:\n\n| Table 1.2 |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Physical quantity | Unit | Symbol | In terms of base units |\n| Plane angle | radian | rad | dimensionless |\n| Solid angle | steradian | sr | dimensionless |\n| Force | newton | N | $\\mathrm{kg} \\mathrm{m} \\mathrm{s}^{-2}$ |\n| Work | joule | J | $\\mathrm{Nm}=\\mathrm{kg} \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ |\n| Power | watt | W | $\\mathrm{J} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}=\\mathrm{kg} \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ |\n| Electric charge | coulomb | C | As |\n| Pressure | pascal | Pa | $\\mathrm{Nm}^{-2}=\\mathrm{kg} \\mathrm{m}^{-1} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ |\n\n- The traditional mathematical units for measuring angles (degree, arcminute, and arcsecond).\n- The traditional units for standard time are (minute, hour, day, and year).\n- The logarithmic units bel (and its multiples, such as the decibel).\n- Two metric units commonly used in ordinary life: the litre for volume and the tonne (metric ton) for large masses.\n- Two non-metric scientific units are atomic mass unit ( $\\mu$ ) and the electron volt (eV).\n- The nautical mile and knot; units traditionally used at sea and in meteorology.\n- The acre and hectare, common metric units of land area.\n- The bar is a unit of pressure and it is commonly used as the millibar in meteorology and the kilobar in engineering.\n- The angstrom and the bam, units used in physics and astronomy.\n\n## Scientific Notation\n\nNumbers are expressed in standard form called scientific notation, which employs powers of ten. The internationally accepted practice is that there should be only one non-zero digit left of decimal. Thus, the number 134.7 should be written as $1.347 \\times 10^{2}$ and 0.0023 be expressed as $2.3 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n# Prefixes\n\nMost prefixes indicate order of magnitude in steps of 1000 and provide a convenient way to express large and small numbers, to eliminate non-significant digits. SI also includes four of the other prefixes to accommodate usage already established before the introduction of SI (Table 1.3). They are centi- $\\left(10^{-3}\\right)$, deci- $\\left(10^{-4}\\right)$, deca- $\\left(10^{1}\\right)$ and hecto- $\\left(10^{2}\\right)$.\n\n## Conventions for Using SI Units\n\nUse of SI units requires special care, more particularly in writing prefixes. Some points to note are:\n\n1. Each SI unit is represented by a symbol not an abbreviation. These symbols are the same in all languages. Hence, correct use of the symbol is very important.\nFor example: For ampere, we should use \"A\" not \"amp\"; for seconds, \"s\" not \"sec\", SI not S.I.\n2. Full name of unit does not begin with capital letter. For example: newton, metre, etc., except Celsius.\n3. Symbols appear in lower case.\n\nFor example: \"m\" for metre, \"s\" for second, etc., exception \"L\" for litre.\n4. Symbols named after scientists have initial letters capital.\nFor example: \"N\" for newton, \"Pa\" for pascal, \"W\" for watt.\n5. Symbols and prefixes are printed in upright (roman) style regardless of the type style in surrounding text.\nFor example: a distance of 50 m .\n6. Symbols do not take plural form.\n\nFor example: $1 \\mathrm{~mm}, 100 \\mathrm{~mm}, 1 \\mathrm{~kg}, 60 \\mathrm{~kg}$.\n7. No fullstop or dot is placed after the symbol except at the end of the sentence.\n8. Prefix is written before and without space to base unit. For example: \"mL\" not mL or \"ms\" not m s.\n9. Base units are written one space apart. Leave a space even between the number (value) and the symbol. For example: $1 \\mathrm{~kg}, 10 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$, etc.\n\nTable 1.3\nSome Prefixes for Powers of Ten\n\n| Factor | Prefix | Symbol |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $10^{10}$ | atto | a |\n| $10^{10}$ | femto | f |\n| $10^{10}$ | pico | p |\n| $10^{10}$ | nano | n |\n| $10^{10}$ | micro | $\\mu$ |\n| $10^{3}$ | mill | m |\n| $10^{3}$ | cent | c |\n| $10^{1}$ | deci | d |\n| $10^{1}$ | deca | da |\n| $10^{2}$ | hecto | h |\n| $10^{3}$ | blo | k |\n| $10^{5}$ | mega | M |\n| $10^{6}$ | glga | G |\n| $10^{10}$ | fena | T |\n| $10^{10}$ | peta | P |\n| $10^{10}$ | exa | E |\n\n|  | Interval (s) |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Age of the universe | $5 \\times 10^{17}$ |\n| Age of the Earth | $1.4 \\times 10^{17}$ |\n| One year | $3.2 \\times 10^{7}$ |\n| One day | $8.6 \\times 10^{4}$ |\n| Time between | $8 \\times 10^{-1}$ |\n| normal heartbeats | $8 \\times 10^{-1}$ |\n| Period of audible | $1 \\times 10^{-3}$ |\n| sound waves | $1 \\times 10^{-6}$ |\n| Period of typical | $1 \\times 10^{-15}$ |\n| radiowaves | $2 \\times 10^{-15}$ |\n| Period of vibration |  |\n| of an atom in a |  |\n| solid |  |\n| Period of visible |  |\n| light waves |  |\n\nApproximate Values of Some Time Intervals\n\n## Mass can be thought of as a form of energy. In effect, the mass is highly concentrated form of energy. Einstein's famous equation, Ennac ${ }^{2}$ means:\n\nEnergy $=$ mass $x$ (speed of light) ${ }^{2}$\nAccording to this equation 1 kg mass is actually $9 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~J}$ of energy.\n\n10. Compound prefixes are not allowed:\n\nFor example: $1 \\mu \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ should be 1 pF .\n11. When base unit of multiple is raised to a power, the power applies to whole multiple and not to base unit alone.\nFor example: $1 \\mathrm{~km}^{2}=1(\\mathrm{~km})^{2}=1 \\times\\left(10^{3} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)^{2}=1 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$.\n12. Use negative index notation ( $\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$ ) instead of solidus ( $\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$ ).\n13. Use scientific notation, that is, one non-zero digit left of decimal.\n\nFor example: $143.7=1.437 \\times 10^{2}$.\n14. Do not mix symbols and names in the same expression.\n\nFor example: metre per second or $\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$, notmetre/sec or $\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{sec}$ ond.\n15. Practical work should be recorded in most convenient units depending upon the instruments being used.\nFor Example: Measurements using screw gauge should be recorded in mm but the final results must be recorded to the appropriate base units.\n16. System International do not allow the use of former CGS System units such as dyne, erg, gausa, poise, torr, etc.\n\n# 1.3 UNCERTAINTY IN MEASUREMENT\n\nYou can count the number of pages of a book exactly but measurement of its length needs some measuring instrument. Every instrument is calibrated to a certain smallest division mark on it and this fact puts a limit regarding its accuracy. When you take a reading with one instrument, its limit of measurement is the smallest division or graduation on its scale. Hence, every measured quantity has some uncertainty aboutits value. When a measurement is made, it is taken to the nearest graduation or marking on the scale. You can estimate the maximum uncertainty as being one smallest division of the instrument. This is called absolute uncertainty. It is one millimetre on a metre rule that is graduated in millimetres. For example, if one edge of the book coincides with 10.0 cm mark and the other with 33.5 cm , then the length with uncertainty is given by\n\n$$\n(33.5 \\pm 0.05) \\mathrm{cm}-(10.0 \\pm 0.05) \\mathrm{cm}=(23.5 \\pm 0.1) \\mathrm{cm}\n$$\n\nIt means that the true length of the book is in between 23.4 cm and 23.6 cm . Hence, the maximum uncertainty is $\\pm 0.05 \\mathrm{~cm}$, which is equivalent to an uncertainty of 0.1 cm . Infact, it is equal to least count of the metre rule. Uncertainty may be recorded as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Fractional uncertainty }=\\frac{\\text { Absolute uncertainty }}{\\text { Measured value }} \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad \\text { Percentage uncertainty }=\\frac{\\text { Absolute uncertainty }}{\\text { Measured value }} \\times 100 \\%\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## Uncertainty in Digital Instruments\n\nSome modern measuring instruments have a digital scale. We usually estimate one\n\n# Physics II\n\ndigit beyond what is certain: with a digital scale, this is reflected in some fluctuations of the last digit. If the last digit fluctuates by 1 or 2 , write down that last digit. If fluctuation is more than 2 or so in the last digit, it may mean that the reading is being influenced by some factor such as air currents. Regardless of the reason, a large fluctuation may mean that the displayed digit is not really significant.\nThe indication of uncertainty in a recorded value has been simplified using significant figures. If a measurement is recorded using the knowledge of significant figures, then its last digit, which is an estimation, is an indication of the accuracy of the recorded value.\n\n### 1.4 USE OF SIGNIFICANT FIGURES\n\nThe number of digits of a measurement about which we do feel reasonably sure are called significant figures. Infact, they reflect the use of actual instrument used for that measurement. While using a calculator, the result of any calculation contains many digits after the decimal point. The additional digits may mislead another person who uses those figures into believing them. Hence, they are to be rounded off to the correct number of significant figures. This can be done by keeping in view the uncertainty or the least count of the instrument while recording observations and also quoting results of any calculations to the correct numbers of significant figures. It is better to quote the result in scientific notation to avoid any ambiguity regarding the number of significant figures.\nFor example, weighing the same object with different balances:\nElectronic balance: mass $=3.145 \\pm 0.001 \\mathrm{~g}$\nUsually, the uncertainty $\\pm 0.001 \\mathrm{~g}$ or $\\pm 0.1 \\mathrm{~g}$ is dropped, and it is understood that the number quoted has an uncertainty of at least 1 unit in the last digit. All digits which are quoted are called significant figures.\n\nIn any measurement, the accurately known digits and the first estimated or doubtful digit are called significant figures.\nProper use of significant figures ensures that we correctly represent the uncertainty of our measurements. For example, scientists immediately realize that the reported mass 3.145 g is more accurate than a reported mass of 3.1 g , reflecting the use of a better or more precise instrument. As we improve the quality of our measuring instrument and techniques, we extend the result to more and more significant figures and\n\n# Physical\n\ncorrespondingly improve the experimental accuracy of the result.\n\n## Working with significant figures\n\n## (i) Counting significant digits\n\n(a) All digits $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ are significant. However, zeros may or may not be significant. In case of zeros, the following rules may be adopted:\n(b) Azero between two significant figures is itself significant.\n(c) Zeros to the left most significant figure are not significant. For example, none of the zeros in 0.00467 or 02.59 are significant.\n(d) Zeros to the right of a significant figure may or may not be significant. In decimal fraction, zeros to the right of a significant figure are significant. For example, all the zeros in 3.570 or 7.4000 are significant. However, in integers such as $8,000 \\mathrm{~kg}$, the number of significant zeros is determined by the precision of the measuring instrument. If the measuring scale has a least count of 1 kg , then there are four significant figures written in scientific notation as $8.000 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~kg}$. If the least count of the scale is 10 kg , then the number of significant figures will be 3 written in scientific notation as $8.00 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~kg}$ and so on.\n(e) When a measurement is recorded in scientific notation or standard form, the figures other than the powers of ten are significant figures. For example, a measurement recorded as $8.70 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~kg}$ has three significant figures.\n\n## (ii) Multiplying or dividing numbers\n\nKeep a number of significant figures in the product or quotient not more than that contained in the least accurate factor i.e., the factor containing the least number of significant figures. For example, the computation of the following using a calculator, gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{5.348 \\times 10^{-2} \\times 3.64 \\times 10^{4}}{1.336}-1.45768982 \\times 10^{3}\n$$\n\nAs the factor $3.64 \\times 10^{4}$, the least accurate in the above calculation has three significant figures, the answer should be written to three significant figures only. The other figures are insignificant and should be deleted. While deleting the figures, the last significant figure to be retained is rounded off for which the following rules are followed:\n\nRemember Thumb Rule\nFor calculation of end result:\n\n- Addition / Subtraction: same precision.\n- Multiplication/Division: same accuracy (Same number of significant figures).\n(a) If the first digit dropped is less than 5 , the last digit retained should remain unchanged.\n(b) If the first digit dropped is more than 5 , the digit to be retained is increased by one.\n(c) If the digit to be dropped is 5 , the previous digit which is to be retained is increased by one if it is odd and retained as such if it is even. For example, the following numbers are rounded off to three significant figures as follows. The digits are deleted one by one.\n\n| Physica II |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 43.75 | is rounded off as | 43.8 |\n| 56.8546 | is rounded off as | 56.9 |\n| 73.650 | is rounded off as | 73.6 |\n| 64.350 | is rounded off as | 64.4 |\n\nFollowing this rule, the correct answer of the computation given in section (ii) is $1.46 \\times 10^{5}$.\n\n## (iii) In adding or subtracting numbers\n\nThe number of decimal places retained in the answer should be equal to the smallest number of decimal places in any of the quantities being added or subtracted. In this case, the number of significant figures is not important. It is the position of decimal that matters. For example, suppose we wish to add the following quantities expressed in metres.\n(a) 72.1\n(b) 2.7543\n3.42\n4.10\n0.003\n1.273\n75.523\n8.1273\nCorrect answer: 75.5 m\n8.13 m\n\n## Thumb Rule for Uncertainty\n\nFor average value of many readings:\n\n- Mean deviation from an average value.\n- Periodic Uncertainty:\n\nDivide least count of timing device by the number of oscillations.\n\n## Cunich Oude\n\n1. Give the correct number of significant figures for $0.0054 \\mathrm{~m}, 0.03030 \\mathrm{~m}$, $40.0 \\mathrm{~m}, 0.6 \\mathrm{~m}, 8.20 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~m}$.\n2. Give the answer to the appropriate number of significant figures.\n$2602 \\mathrm{~kg}+36.02 \\mathrm{~kg}+54.1 \\mathrm{~kg}=$ ?\n3. Give the answer to the appropriate number of significant figures.\n$3.54 \\mathrm{~kg}-2.4 \\mathrm{~kg}=$ ?\n4. Give the answer to the appropriate number of significant figure.\n$2.45 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m} \\times 2.46 \\mathrm{~m} / 3.6 \\mathrm{~m}=$ ?\n\nIn case (a), the number 72.1 has the smallest decimal places, thus the answer is rounded off to the same position which is then 75.5 m . In case (b), the number 4.10 has the smallest number of decimal places and hence, the answer is rounded off to the same decimal position which is then 8.13 m .\n\n## Limitations of Significant Figures\n\nSignificant figures deal with only one source of uncertainties that inherent in reading the scale. Real experimental uncertainties have many contributions, including personal errors and sometimes hidden systematic errors. One cannot do better than that what the scale reading allows, but the total uncertainty may well be more than what the significant figure of the measurements would suggest.\n\n### 1.5 PRECISION AND ACCURACY\n\nThe terms precision and accuracy are frequently used in physics measurements. They should be distinguished clearly. The precision of a measurement is determined by the instrument or device being used. The smaller the least count the more precise is the measurement. Accuracy is defined\n\nRemember Thumb Rule\n\n- Precision: Less absolute uncertainty.\n- Accuracy: Less \\% age uncertainty.\nas the closeness of a measurement to the exact or accepted value of a physical quantity. It is expressed by the fractional or percentage uncertainty. The smaller the fractional or\n\n# Physica II\n\npercentage uncertainty, the more accurate is the measurement.\nFor example, the length of an object is recorded as 25.5 cm by using a metre rule having smallest division in millimetre. Its precision or absolute uncertainty (least count) $= \\pm 0.1 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nFractional uncertainty $=\\frac{0.1 \\mathrm{~cm}}{25.5 \\mathrm{~cm}}=0.004$\nPercentage uncertainty $=\\frac{0.1 \\mathrm{~cm}}{25.5 \\mathrm{~cm}} \\times 100 \\%=0.4 \\%$\nAnother measurement taken by Vernier Callipers with least count 0.01 cm is recorded as 0.45 cm . It has precision or absolute uncertainty (least count) $= \\pm 0.01 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nFractional uncertainty $=\\frac{0.01 \\mathrm{~cm}}{0.45 \\mathrm{~cm}}=0.02$\nPercentage uncertainty $=\\frac{0.01 \\mathrm{~cm}}{0.45 \\mathrm{~cm}} \\times 100 \\%=2 \\%$\nThus, the reading 25.5 cm taken by metre rule is although less precise but is more accurate having less percentage uncertainty or error.\nWhereas the reading 0.45 cm taken by Vernier Callipers is more precise but is less accurate. In fact, it is the relative measurement which is important. The smaller a physical quantity, the more precise instrument should be used. Here the measurement 0.45 cm demands that a more precise instrument, such as micrometer screw gauge, with least count 0.001 cm , should nave been used. Hence, we can conclude that:\nA precise measurement is the one which has less precision or absolute uncertainty and an accurate measurement is the one which has less fractional or percentage uncertainty.\nWe can never make an exact measurement. The best we can do is to come as close as possible with in the limitation of the measuring instrument.\n\n### 1.6 ASSESSMENT OF TOTAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINAL RESULT\n\nKnowing the uncertainties in all the factors involved in a calculation, the maximum possible uncertainty or error in the final result can be found as follows:\nWe use many devices to measure physical quantities, such as length, time, and temperature. They all have some limit of precision.\nThese are not decoration pieces of glass but are the earliest known exquisite and sensitive thermometers, built by the Accademia del Cimento (16671667), in Florence. They contained alcohol, some times coloured red for easier reading.\n\n# 1. For addition and Subtraction\n\nAbsolute uncertainties are added. For example, the distance between two positions $x=15.4 \\pm 0.1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and $x_{1}=25.6 \\mathrm{~cm} \\pm 0.1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ is recorded as:\n$x=x_{2}-x_{1}=10.2 \\pm 0.2 \\mathrm{~cm}$\nand addition of two lengths is:\n$t_{1}=8.5 \\pm 0.1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and $t_{2}=12.6 \\pm 0.1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ recorded as:\n$t=t_{1}+t_{2}=21.1 \\pm 0.2 \\mathrm{~cm}$\n\n## 2. For multiplication and division\n\nFor your information\nColour printing uses just four colours cyan, magenta, yellow and black to produce the entire range of colours. All the colours in this book have been made from just these four colours.\n\nPercentage uncertainties are added. For example, the maximum possible uncertainty in the value of resistance $R$ of a conductor determined by the potential difference $V$ applied across the conductor resulting in current flowing through it is estimated as under:\n\nLet\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV & =3.4 \\pm 0.1 \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\nI & =0.68 \\pm 0.05 \\mathrm{~A} \\\\\nR & =\\frac{V}{I}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nusing\nPercentage uncertainty in $V=\\frac{0.1 \\mathrm{~V}}{3.4 \\mathrm{~V}} \\times 100 \\%=3 \\%$\nPercentage uncertainty in $I=\\frac{0.05 \\mathrm{~A}}{0.58 \\mathrm{~A}} \\times 100 \\%=7 \\%$\n\n## Thumb Rule for Total Uncertainty\n\n- For addition and subtraction: Absolute uncertainties are added.\n- For multiplication and division: Percentage uncertainties are added.\n- For power factor: Power factor $x$ Percentage uncertainty\n\nHence, total percentage uncertainty in the value of $R$ is $3+7=10 \\%$\nThe value of $R$ will be written as:\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{3.4 \\mathrm{~V}}{0.68 \\mathrm{~A}}=5.0 \\mathrm{ohm}\n$$\n\nHence, $R=5.0 \\pm 0.5$ ohms, uncertainty being an estimate only, is recorded by one significant figure.\n\n## 3. For Power Factor\n\n|  |  |\n| :--: | :--: |\n|  |  |\n\nThe percentage uncertainty is multiplied by the power factor in the formula. For example, the calculation of cross-sectional area of a cylinder of radius $r=1.25 \\mathrm{~cm}$ using formula for Area $A=\\pi r^{2}$ is given by the \\%age uncertainty which is $A=2 \\times \\%$ age uncertainty in radius $r$. As uncertainty is multiplied by power factor, it increases the precision demand of measurement. When the radius of a small sphere is measured as 1.25 cm by Vernier Callipers with least count 0.01 cm , then\nThe radius ris recorded as\n\n$$\nr=1.25 \\pm 0.01 \\mathrm{~cm}\n$$\n\n\\%age uncertainty in radius ris\n\n$$\nr=\\frac{0.01}{1.25} \\times 100 \\%=0.8 \\%\n$$\n\nTotal percentage uncertainty in area $A=2 \\times 0.8=1.6 \\%$\nThus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA & =\\pi r^{2} \\\\\n& =3.14(1.25)^{2}=4.906 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} \\text { with } 1.8 \\% \\text { uncertainty }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# Physica II\n\nThus, the result should be recorded as $A=4.91 \\pm 0.08 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$\nExample 7.1 The length, breadth and thickness of a metal sheet are $2.03 \\mathrm{~m}, 1.22 \\mathrm{~m}$ and 0.95 cm respectively. Calculate the volume of the sheet correct up to the appropriate significant digits.\n\nSolution Given Length\nBreadth\nThickness\nVolume\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ell & =2.03 \\mathrm{~m} \\\\\nb & =1.22 \\mathrm{~m} \\\\\nh & =0.95 \\mathrm{~cm}=0.95 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~m} \\\\\nV & =\\ell \\times b \\times h=2.03 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 1.22 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 0.95 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m} \\\\\n& =2.35277 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}^{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs the factor 0.95 cm has minimum number of significant figures equal to two, therefore, volume is recorded up to 2 significant figures, hence, $V=2.4 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$\nExample 7.2 The mass of a metal box measured by a lever balance is 3.25 kg . Two silver coins of masses 10.01 g and 10.02 g measured by a beam balance are added to it. What is now the total mass of the box correct up to the appropriate precision?\n\n## Solution\n\nTotal mass when silver coins are added to box $=3.25 \\mathrm{~kg}+0.01001 \\mathrm{~kg}+0.01002 \\mathrm{~kg}$ $=3.27003 \\mathrm{~kg}$\nSince least precise mass is 3.25 kg , having two decimal places, hence, total mass should be reported to 2 decimal places which is the appropriate precision.\nThus\nTotal mass $=3.27 \\mathrm{~kg}$\nExample 7.3 The diameter and length of a metal cylinder measured with the help of Vernier Callipers of least count 0.01 cm are 1.25 cm and 3.35 cm , respectively.

Dimensions deal with the qualitative nature of a physical quantity in terms of fundamental quantities. The quantities such as length, depth, height, diameter, light year are all measured in metre and denoted by the same dimension, basically known as length given by symbol $L$ written within square brackets [L]. Similarly, the other fundamental quantities, mass, time, electric current and temperature are denoted by specific symbols [M], [T], [A] and [6], respectively. These five dimensions have been chosen as being basic because they are easy to measure in experiments.\nThe dimensions of other quantities indicate how they are related to the basic quantities and are combination of fundamental dimensions. For example, speed $v$ is measured in metres per second, so it has the dimensions of length [L] divided by time [T].\n\n$$\n[v]=[L] /[T]=[L]\\left[T^{2}\\right]=\\left[\\mathrm{LT}^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nAs the acceleration $a=\\Delta v / \\Delta t$\nDimensions of acceleration are\n\n$$\n[a]=[v] /[T]=\\left[\\mathrm{LT}^{2}\\right] /[T]=\\left[\\mathrm{LT}^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nAlso, dimensions of force can be written as\n\n$$\n[F]=[m][a]=[M]\\left[\\mathrm{LT}^{2}\\right]=\\left[\\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nBy the use of dimensionality, we can check the homogeneity (correctness) of a physical equation, and also, we can derive formula for a physical quantity.\n\n## Homogeneity of Physical Equations\n\nThe correctness of an equation can be checked by showing that the dimensions of quantities on both sides of the equation are the same. This is known as principle of homogeneity.\nSuppose a car starts from rest $\\left(v_{i}=0\\right)$ and covers a distance $S$ in time $t$ moving with an acceleration a. The\nThe ceslum atomic frequency standard at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Colorado (USA). It is the primary standard for the unit of time.\n\nequation of motion is given by,\n\n$$\nS=v_{1} t+\\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nS=\\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}\n$$\n\nNumerical factors like $1 / 2$ have no dimensions, so they can be ignored. By putting the dimensions of both sides of the equation:\n\n$$\n[S]=[a]\\left[t^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nWriting the symbols of dimensions $[L]=\\left[\\mathrm{LT}^{2}\\right]\\left[\\mathrm{T}^{2}\\right]$\n\n$$\n[L]=\\left[\\mathrm{LT}^{2} \\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n[L]=[L]\n$$\n\nThis shows that dimensions on both sides of equation are the same, therefore, the equation is dimensionally correct.\n\n# Derivation of a Formula\n\nDimensionality can be used to derive a possible formula for a phyaical quantity by correct estimation of various factors on which the quantity depends.\nThe davice which made the pendulum clock practicai.\n\nExample 1.4 Derive a formula for the centripetal force required to keep an object moving along a circle with uniform speed. Assuming that centripetal force depends on mass of the object, radius of the circle and uniform speed.\nSolution As force depends on mass $m$ of the object, radius $r$ of the circle and uniform speed $v$, we can write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F a m^{2} v^{2} r^{2} \\\\\n& F=\\left(\\text { constant }\\right) m^{2} v^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the exponents (powers) $a, b$ and $c$ are to be determined. By the principle of homogeneity, the dimensions on both sides of the equation should be the same. Since, constant has no dimension so by ignoring it, we write the above equation in terms of dimensions as,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& {[F]=\\left[m^{2}\\right]\\left[v^{2}\\right]\\left[r^{2}\\right]} \\\\\n& {\\left[\\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\\right]=\\left[\\mathrm{M}^{2}\\right]\\left[\\mathrm{L} / \\mathrm{T}\\right]^{2}\\left[\\mathrm{~L}^{2}\\right]} \\\\\n& {\\left[\\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\\right]=\\left[\\mathrm{M}^{2}\\right]\\left[\\mathrm{LT}^{-1}\\right]^{2}\\left[\\mathrm{~L}^{2}\\right]} \\\\\n& {\\left[\\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\\right]=\\left[\\mathrm{M}^{2} \\mathrm{~L}^{2-2} \\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right]}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nComparing the powers of dimensions on both sides of the above equation, we have\n\n$$\na=1\n$$\n\n## Bevare!\n\nCalculators are designed to yield as many digits as the memory of the calculator chip permits. Hence, be sure to round off the final answers of calculations down to correct number of significant figures.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nb+c & =1 \\\\\n-b & =-2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolving the above equations, we have $a=1, b=2, c=-1$\nPutting the values of $a, b$ and $c$ in equation (i), we have\n\n$$\nF=(\\text { constant }) m v^{2} r^{1}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nF=(\\text { constant }) m v^{2} / r\n$$\n\nThe numerical value of the constant cannot be determined by dimensional analysis. However, it can be found by experiments. In the above equation, numerical value of the constant happens to be \" 1 \", so the equation reduces to:\n\n$$\nF=m v^{2} / r\n$$\n\n# Limitations in Dimensional Analysis\n\nThe dimensional method cannot identify where an equation is wrong. Even if an equation is proved correct, we can only say the equation might be correct, for the reason that the method does not provide a check on any numerical factor or constant. That can only be determined by experiments or plotting some suitable graph between the variables.\n\n## QUESTIONS\n\n## Multiple Choice Questions\n\n## Tick $(\\checkmark)$ the correct answer.\n\n1.1 The purpose of study and discoveries in Physics is:\n(a) the probing of interstellar spaces\n(b) the betterment of mankind\n(c) the development of destructive technology in warfare\n(d) deveiooment in aesthetics for the world\n1.2 The length of a steel pipe is in between 0.7 m to 0.8 m .

Many problems in physics require to distinguish between scalar and vector quantities to apply the correct mathematical and conceptual approaches. Understanding scalars and vectors help us to grasp how Physics applies to real-world situations, such as calculating the total distance travelled (scalar) or determining the magnitude and direction of force (vector). Learning these concepts develops critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This chapter is primarily concerned with vector algebra and its application in uniform accelerated motion, in a straight line, motion of freely falling bodies in uniform gravitational field, projectile motion, and interaction between objects in one and two dimensions.\n\n### 2.1 SCALARS\n\nScalars are physical quantities that are described solely by a magnitude (size or amount) without any mention of direction. Thus, scalars are directionless and can be fully characterized by a single number and its associated unit.\n\n## Examples:\n\nMass: The amount of matter in an object. For example, 2 kg .\nDistance: The total length of the path travelled by an object irrespective of the direction. For example, 50 m .\nSpeed: The rate at which an object covers distance. For example, $40 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~h}^{-1}$.\nTime: The duration between two events taking place. For example, 20 s .\nEnergy: The capacity to do work. For example, 25 J .\nTemperature: A measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. For example, $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\n### 2.2 VECTORS\n\nThose physical quantities which require magnitude as well as direction for their complete specification are known as vectors.\n\n## Examples:\n\nDisplacement: The change in position of an object. It has length, a distance (magnitude) and a direction (e.g. 10 m towards west).\nVelocity: The speed of an object in a particular direction (e.g., $50 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~h}^{-1}$ towards west).\nAcceleration: The rate of change of velocity that occurs in either speed or direction or both (e.g., $10 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ upward).\nForce: A push or pull acting on an object, determined by its magnitude and direction (e.g; 20 N to the right)\n\n# Graphical Representation of a Vector\n\nA good way to represent a vector quantity is to use a vector diagram, in which vectors are often represented by arrows. The length of the arrows indicates the magnitude and the head of the arrow shows the direction of the vector. Vectors are typically denoted by bold face letters (e.g; $\\mathrm{V}, \\mathrm{F}$ ) or an arrow above symbol ( $\\overline{\\mathrm{A}}$ ).\n\n## Rectangular Components of a Vector\n\nA component of a vector is its effective value in a given direction. A vector may be considered as the resultant of its component vectors along the specified directions. It is usually convenient to resolve a vector into its components along the mutually perpendicular directions. Such components are called rectangular components.\nLet there be a vector $A$ represented by a line $O P$ making an angle $\\theta$ with the $x$-axis. Draw projection $O M$ of vector $A$ on $x$-axis and projection $O N$ of vector $A$ on $y$-axis as shown in Fig.2.1. Projection OM being along $x$-direction is represented by $A_{x}$ and projection $O N$ along $y$-direction is represented by $A_{y}$. By applying head to tail rule:\n\n$$\nA=A_{x}+A_{y}\n$$\n\nThus, $A_{x}$ and $A_{y}$ are the comoponants of vector $A$. Since these are at right angles to each other, they are called rectangular components of $A$. Considering the right angled triangle OMP, the magnitude of $A_{x}$ or $x$-component of $A$ is:\n\n$$\nA_{x}=A \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\nAnd the magnitude of $A_{x}$ or $y$-component of $A$ is:\n\n$$\nA_{y}=A \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\n## Determination of a Vector from its Rectangular Components\n\nIf the rectangular components of a vector as shown in Fig.(2.1) are given, we can find out the magnitude of the vector by using Pythagorean Theorem.\nIn the right angle $\\triangle O M P$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(O P)^{2} & =(O M)^{2}+(M P)^{2} \\\\\nA^{2} & =A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2} \\\\\nA & =\\sqrt{A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe direction $\\theta$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\tan \\theta=\\frac{M P}{O M}=\\frac{A_{y}}{A_{x}}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\theta=\\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{A_{y}}{A_{x}}\\right)\n$$\n\n# 2.3 PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS\n\nThere are two types of vector multiplications. The product of these two types are known as scalar product and vector product.\n\nIf the product of two vectors results in a scalar quantity, it is called scalar product while if the product of two vectors results in a vector quantity, it is called vector product.\n\n## Scalar or Dot Product\n\nThe scalar product of two vectors $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ is written as $\\mathbf{A} . \\mathbf{B}$ and is defined as:\n\n$$\nA .

For that purpose, place together the tail of vectors $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ to define the plane of vectors $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$. The direction of the product vector is perpendicular to this plane. Rotate the First vector $\\mathbf{A}$ into $\\mathbf{B}$ through the smaller of the two possible angles and curl the fingers of the right hand in the direction of rotation, keeping the thumb erect. The direction of the product vector will be along the erect thumb, as shown in the Fig 2.4 (b). Because of this direction rule, $\\mathbf{B} \\times \\mathbf{A}$ is a vector opposite in sign to $\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ (Fig. 2.4-c). Hence,\n## Characteristics of Cross Product\n\n1.

The magnitude of $\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed with $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$\n\nas two adjacent sides (Fig.2.4-d).\n\n# Examples of Vector Product\n\ni. When a force $F$ is applied on a rigid body at a point whose position vector is $\\mathbf{r}$ from any point on the axis about which the body rotates, then the turning effect of the force called the torque $\\tau$ is given by the vector product of $r$ and $F$.\n\n$$\n\\tau=r \\times F\n$$\n\nii.

There are three ways to pair these variables up: velocity-time, position-time and velocity-position. In this order, they are called first equation of motion, second equation of motion and third equation of motion, respectively.\nThese equations of motion can only be applied to those objects, which are moving in a straight line with constant acceleration.\n\n## Derivation of First Equation of Motion\n\nSuppose a body is moving with uniform acceleration along a straight line with an initial velocity $v_{i}$. Suppose its velocity changes from initial value $v_{i}$ to a final value $v_{f}$ in time interval $t$. Then the acceleration produced in the body during this time interval is given as:\n\n$$\na=\\frac{v_{i}-v_{i}}{t}\n$$\n\nRearranging, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{i}-v_{i} & =a t \\\\\nv_{i} & =v_{i}+a t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is the first equation of motion. It correlates the final velocity attained by a body with initial velocity and the time interval $t$, when moving with constant acceleration $a$.\n\n## Derivation of First Equation of Motion By Graphical Method\n\nFirst equation of motion can be derived using velocity-time graph for an object moving with initial velocity $v_{i}$ final velocity $v_{f}$ and constant acceleration $a$.\nLet the velocity of a body at point $A$ be $v_{i}$ which changes to $v_{i}$ at point $B$ in time interval $t$ as shown in Fig.2.5. A perpendicular BD is drawn from point $B$ to $x$-axis and another perpendicular BE from B on $y$-axis, such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathrm{OA}=\\mathrm{v}=\\text { Initial velocity of the body } \\\\\n& \\mathrm{OE}=\\mathrm{DB}=\\mathrm{v}=\\text { Final velocity of the body }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom the graph, it can observed that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathrm{DB}=\\mathrm{DC}+\\mathrm{CB} \\\\\n& \\mathrm{DB}=\\mathrm{OA}+\\mathrm{CB} \\quad(\\mathrm{As} \\quad \\mathrm{OA}=\\mathrm{DC})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore\n\n$$\nv_{t}=C B+v_{t}\n$$\n\nFig. 2.5: Velocity-Time Graph\nThe value of CB in the above equation can be determined by taking the slope of line $A B$, which is equal to acceleration $a$.\n\n$$\na=\\frac{C B}{A C}\n$$\n\nAs\n\n$$\nA C=t\n$$\n\nSo\n\n$$\na=\\frac{C B}{t}\n$$\n\nor\n$B C=a t$\n$(2.13)$\n\nCombining Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13), we have\n\n$$\nv_{t}=v_{i}+a t\n$$\n\nThis is the first equation of motion.\n\n# Derivation of Second Equation of Motion\n\nSuppose a body is moving with uniform acceleration a along a straight line with an initial velocity $v_{0}$ which become $v_{0}$ after time interval $t$. Let it covers a distance $S$ in a particular direction during time $t$, then using the definition of velocity as rate of change of displacement, we can write\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Velocity } \\quad=\\text { Displacement } / \\text { Time } \\\\\n& \\text { Displacement }=\\text { Velocity } \\times \\text { Time }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf velocity of the body is not constant, we can use average velocity instead of velocity.\nThus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Displacement }=\\text { Average velocity } \\times \\text { Time } \\\\\n& \\text { Displacement }=\\frac{(\\text { Initial velocity }+(\\text { Final velocity })}{2} \\times \\text { Time } \\\\\n& S=\\frac{\\left(v_{i}+v_{i}\\right)}{2} \\times t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing first equation of motion, $\\quad S=\\frac{\\left(v_{i}+v_{i}+a t\\right)}{2} \\times t$\n\n$$\nS=\\frac{\\left(2 v_{i}+a t\\right)}{2} \\times t\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 2 S=2 v_{1} t+a t^{2} \\\\\n& S=v_{1} t+\\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is the second equation of motion.\n\n# Derivation of Second Equation of Motion by Graphical Method\n\nSecond equation of motion can be derived using velocity-time graph for a body moving with initial velocity $v_{1}$ which attains a final value $v_{f}$ in time interval $t$. While moving with constant acceleration $a$, it covers a displacement $S$ in time $t$.\nIt can be seen from the graph that distance travelled by the body is, $S=v \\times t$.\nAlso\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S=\\text { Area of the figure OABD } \\\\\n& S=(\\text { Area of the rectangle } O A C D)+(\\text { Area of the triangle } A B C) \\\\\n& S=(\\mathrm{OA} \\times \\mathrm{OD})+\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathrm{AC} \\times \\mathrm{BC})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{OA} & =v_{1} \\text { and } \\mathrm{OD}=\\mathrm{AC}=t . \\mathrm{So} \\text {, the above equation becomes: } \\\\\nS & =v_{1} \\times t+\\frac{1}{2}(i \\times B C)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $B C=a t$ (From graphical representation of first equation of motion). By putting this value in the above equation, we have\n\n$$\nS=v_{1} t+\\frac{1}{2}(i \\times a t)\n$$\n\n$$\nS=v_{1} t+\\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}\n$$\n\nThis is the second equation of motion.\n\n## Derivation of third equation of motion\n\nConsider a body moving along a straight line with an initial velocity $v_{1}$ which attains a final value $v_{f}$ in time $t$. Let the displacement of the body be $S$ during this time interval. Then, we can write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Displacement } & =\\left(\\frac{\\text { Initial velocity }+ \\text { Final velocity }}{2}\\right) \\times \\text { Time } \\\\\nS & =\\frac{\\left(v_{1}+v_{f}\\right)}{2} \\times t \\\\\n2 S & =\\left(v_{f}+v_{f}\\right) \\times t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing the first equation of motion:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v_{f}=v_{1}+a t \\\\\n& t=\\frac{v_{f}-v_{f}}{a}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nPutting the value of $t$ in Eq.

If its direction of motion does not change, then all the vector quantities can be manipulated like scalars. In such cases, initial velocity is taken as positive. A negative sign is assigned to quantities where direction is opposite to that of initial velocity. In the absence of air resistance, all objects in free fall at the surface of the Earth, move towards the Earth with a uniform acceleration. This acceleration is known as acceleration due to gravity, denoted by $g$ and its average value at the Earth surface is taken as $9.8 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ in the downward direction. The equation for uniformly accelerated motion can also be applied to free fall motion of the object by replacing a by g .\n\nExample 2.2 A car travelling at $10 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ accelerates uniformally at $2 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}$.

According to Gallio, all bodies fall freely (in vacuum) under the acceleration due to gravity, denoted by ' $g$ '. Its experimental value is $9.8 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ in SI units. This means that different bodies, when allowed to fall from the same height, strike the ground with the same velocity. As regards the sign of $g$, it is taken positive for a falling body (when initial velocity is zero) and negative for a body projected vertically upward (when initial velocity is not zero).\nThe equations of motion for a freely falling body, on putting $a=g$, become\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nv_{t}=v_{t}+g t \\\\\nS=h=v_{t} t+\\frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\\\\nv_{t}^{2}-v_{t}^{2}=2 g h\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nExample 2.5.

Now we consider the motion of a ball, when it is thrown horizontally from certain height. It is observed that the ball travels forward as well as falls downward, until it strikes something such as ground. Suppose that the ball leaves the hand of the thrower at pointA(Fig 2.8-a) and that its velocity at that instant is completely horizontal. Let this velocity be $v_{1}$. According to Newton's first law of motion, there will be no acceleration in horizontal direction, unless a horizontally directed force acts on the ball. Ignoring the air friction, only force acting on the ball during flight is the force of gravity. There is no horizontal force acting on it. So, its horizontal velocity will remain unchanged and will be $v_{1}$, until the ball hits the ground. The horizontal motion of ball is simple. The ball moves with constant horizontal velocity component. Hence, horizontal distance $x$ is given by\n\n$$\nx=v_{x} \\times t\n$$\n\nFig. 2.8(a)\nFig. 2.8(b)\n\nIt is not necessary that an object should be thrown with some initial velocity in the horizontal direction. A football kicked off by a player; a ball thrown by a cricketer and a missile fired from a launching pad, all projected at some angles with the horizontal, are called projectiles.\n\nProjectile motion is two dimensional motion under constant acceleration due to gravity.\n\nIn such cases, the motion of a projectile can be studied easily by resolving it into horizontal and vertical components which are independent of each other. Suppose that a projectile is fired in a direction angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal by velocity $v_{1}$ as shown in Fig.2.8(b). Let components of velocity $v_{1}$ along the horizontal and vertical directions be $v_{1} \\cos \\theta$ and $v_{1} \\sin \\theta$, respectively. The horizontal acceleration is $a_{v}=0$ because we have neglected air resistance and no other force is acting along this direction, whereas the vertical acceleration is $a_{v}=g$. Hence, the horizontal component $v_{1}$ remains constant and at any time $t$, we have\n\n$$\nv_{t v}=v_{11}=v_{1} \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\nNow we consider the vertical motion. The initial vertical component of the velocity is $v_{1} \\sin \\theta$ in the upward direction.\nThe vertical component $v_{11}$ at any instant $t$ can be determined by considering the upward motion of projectile as free fall motion $\\left(a_{v}=-g\\right)$. Using 1st equation of motion:\n\n$$\nv_{t v}=v_{1} \\sin \\theta-g t\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of velocity at any instant is:\n\n$$\nv=\\sqrt{v_{t v}^{2}+v_{t y}^{2}}\n$$\n\nThe angle $\\phi$ which this resultant velocity makes with the horizontal can be found from\n\n$$\n\\tan \\phi=\\frac{v_{t y}}{v_{t v}}\n$$\n\nIn projectile motion one may wish to determine the height to which the projectile rises, the time of flight and horizontal range. These are described below.\n\n# Height of the Projectile\n\nIn order to determine the maximum height the projectile attains, we use the equation of motion:\n\n$$\n2 a S=v_{i}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}\n$$\n\nAs body moves upward, $a=-g$, the initial vertical velocity $v_{0}=v_{i} \\sin \\theta=v_{i}$ as $v_{0}=0=v_{i}$, because the body comes to rest after reaching the highest point. Since\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS & =\\text { height }=h \\\\\n-2 g h & =0-v_{i}^{2} \\sin ^{2} \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nh=\\frac{v_{i}^{2} \\sin ^{2} \\theta}{2 g}\n$$\n\nThe height of projectile will be reduced in presence of air resistance. In the presence of air resistance, the upward velocity of the projectile will decrease and hence its height will also decrease during time $t$.\n\n# Time of Flight\n\nThe time taken by body to cover the distance from the place of tis projection to the place where it hits the ground is called the time of flight.\nThis can be obtained by taking $S=h=0$, because body goes up and comes back to the same level, thus covering no vertical distance. If the body is projecting with velocity $v_{i}$ making angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal, then its vertical component will be $v_{i} \\sin \\theta$. Hence, the equation of motion is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S=v_{i} t+\\frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\\\\n& 0=v_{i} \\sin \\theta t \\frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\\\\n& t=\\frac{2 v_{i} \\sin \\theta}{g}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $f$ is the time of flight of the projectile when it is projected from the ground.\n\n## Range of the projectile\n\nMaximum distance which a projectile covers in the horizontal direction is called the range of the projectile.\nTo determine the range $R$ of the projectile, we multiply the horizontal component of the velocity of projection with total time taken by the body to hit the ground after leaving the point of projection. Thus,\n\n$$\nR=v_{N} \\times t\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{v_{i} \\cos \\theta \\times 2 v_{i} \\sin \\theta}{g}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{v_{i}^{2}}{g} 2 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\nFor an angle less than $45^{\\circ}$, the height reached by the projectile and the range both will be less. When the angle of projectile is larger than $45^{\\circ}$, the height attained will be more but the range is again less.\n\n# Physica II\n\nAs $2 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta=\\sin 2 \\theta$, thus, the range of the projectile depends upon the velocity of projection and the angle of projection.\n\nTherefore\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{g} \\sin 2 \\theta\n$$\n\nFor maximum range $R$, the factor $\\sin 2 \\theta=1$, so\n\n$$\n2 \\theta=\\sin ^{-1}(1) \\text { or } 2 \\theta=90^{\\circ} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\theta=45^{\\circ}\n$$\n\nAir resistance will slow down projectile forward motion, reducing its velocity $v_{1}$. The reduction in $v_{1}$ will result in a decrease in the range of projectile.\nFurthermore, air resistance is not constant throughout the flight of the object. As the object slows down, the air resistance experienced by it also decreases. This means that the object retards more slowly and accelerates more slowly as it falls down. This results in a trajectory that is not perfectly parabolic but is skewed, with steeper descent than ascent.\n\nExample 2.6 A ball is thrown with a speed of $30 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ in a direction $30^{\\circ}$ above the horizon. Determine the height to which it rises, the time of flight and the horizontal range.\n\nSolution Initially\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v_{1}=v_{1} \\cos \\theta=30 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\times \\cos 30^{\\circ}=25.98 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\\\\n& v_{1}=v_{1} \\sin \\theta=30 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\times \\sin 30^{\\circ}=15 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs the time of flight, is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nt & =\\frac{2 v_{1}}{g} \\sin \\theta \\\\\n& =\\frac{2 \\times 30 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-}}{9.8 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}} \\times(0.5) \\\\\n\\text { So } & =\\frac{2 \\times 15 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-}}{9.8 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}}=3.1 \\mathrm{~s} \\\\\n\\text { Height } & h=\\frac{v_{1}^{2} \\sin ^{2} \\theta}{2 g} \\\\\n\\text { So } & h=\\frac{\\left(30 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\right)^{2}(0.5)^{2}}{19.6 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}} \\\\\n& h=11.5 \\mathrm{~m} \\\\\n\\text { Range } & R=\\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{g} \\sin 2 \\theta=\\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{g} \\sin 60^{\\circ} \\\\\n\\text { So } & R=\\frac{\\left(30 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\right)^{2} \\times 0.866}{9.8 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}} \\\\\n& =79.53 \\mathrm{~m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor your information\nIn the presence of air friction the trajectory of a high speed projectile falls short of a parabolic path.\n\n# 2.7 MOMENTUM\n\nWe are aware of the fact that moving object possesses a quality by virtue of which it exerts a force on anything that tries to stop it. The faster the object is travelling, the harder it is to stop it. Similarly, if two objects move with the same velocity, then it is more difficult to stop the massive of the two. Newton referred to this property as \"momentum\", a vector quantity defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity. This term is now called linear momentum $p$ of the body and is defined by the relation:\n\n$$\np=m \\vee \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots(2.25)\n$$\n\nIn this expression, $v$ is the velocity of the mass $m$. Linear momentum is, therefore, a vector quantity and has the direction of velocity. The SI unit of momentum is kilogram metre per second ( $\\mathrm{kg} \\mathrm{m} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ). It can also be expressed as newton second (Ns).\n\n## Momentum and Newton's Second Law of Motion\n\nConsider a body of mass $m$ moving with an initial velocity $v_{i}$. Suppose an external force $F$ acts upon it for time $t$ after which velocity becomes $v_{i}$. The acceleration a produced by this force is given by\n\n$$\na=\\frac{v_{r}-v_{i}}{t}\n$$\n\nBy Newton's second law, the acceleration is given as:\n\n$$\na=\\frac{F}{m}\n$$\n\nEquating the two expressions of acceleration, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{F}{m}=\\frac{v_{r}-v_{i}}{t}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nF \\times t=m v_{i}-m v_{i}\n$$\n\nwhere $m v_{1}$ is the initial momentum and $m v_{r}$ is the final momentum of the body.\nWhich hurt you in the above situations (a) or (b) and think why?\n\nThe equation (2.26) shows that change in momentum is equal to the product of force and the time for which force is applied. This form of the second law is more general than the form $F=m a$, because it can easily be extended to account for changes as the body accelerates when its mass also changes. For example, as a rocket accelerates, it loses mass because its fuel is burnt and ejected to provide greater thrust. From Eq. (2.28)\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{m v_{r}-m v_{i}}{t}\n$$\n\nThus, second law of motion can also be stated in terms of momentum as:\n\nCan a moving object experience impulse?\n\n## Your hair acts like a crumple zone on your skull. A force of 5 N might be enough to fracture your naked skull (uranium), but with a covering of skin and hair, a force of 50 N would be needed.\n\nTime rate of change of momentum of a body is equal to the applied force.\n\n# Impulse\n\nSometimes we wish to apply the concept of momentum to cases where the applied force is not constant, it acts for very short time. For example, when a bat hits a cricket ball, the force certainly varies from instant to instant during the collision. In such cases, it is more convenient to deal with the product of force and time ( $F \\times t$ ) instead of either quantity alone. The product of average force $F$ that acts during time tis called impulse given by\n\n$$\n\\text { Impulse }=\\mathrm{F} \\times t=m \\mathrm{v}_{1}-m \\mathrm{v}_{1} \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots(2.27)\n$$\n\nExample 2.7 A 1500 kg car has its velocity reduced from $20 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime}$ to $15 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime \\prime}$ in 3.0 s . How large was the average retarding force?\n\nSolution Using the Eq. (2.27)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F \\times t=m v_{1}-m v_{1} \\\\\n& F \\times 3.0 \\mathrm{~s}=1500 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 15 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime}-1500 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 20 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime} \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad \\begin{aligned}\nF \\quad & =-2500 \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{2} \\\\\n& =-2500 \\mathrm{~N}=-2.5 \\mathrm{kN}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the force is retarding one.\n\n## Law of Conservation of Momentum\n\nLet us consider an isolated system. It is a system on which no external agency exerts any force. For example, the molecules of a gas enclosed in a glass vessel at constant temperature constitute an isolated system. The molecules can collide with one another because of their random motion, but being enclosed by glass vessel, no external agency can exert a force on them.\nConsider an isolated system of two smooth hard interacting balls of masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, moving along the same straight line, in the same direction, with velocities $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ respectively. Both the balls collide and after collision, ball of mass $m_{1}$ moves with velocity $v_{1}$ vand $m_{2}$ moves with velocity $v_{2}^{\\prime}$ in the same direction as shown in Fig. (2.9).\nTo find the change in momentum of mass $m_{1}$.\nUsing Eq. (2.27) as:\nFig. 2.9\n\n$$\nF \\times t=m_{1} v_{1}-m_{1} v_{1}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the ball of mass $m_{2}$, we have\n\n$$\nF^{\\prime} \\times t=m_{2} v_{2}^{\\prime}-m_{2} v_{2}\n$$\n\nAdding these two expressions, we have\n\n$$\n\\left(F+F^{\\prime}\\right) t=\\left(m_{1} v_{1}^{\\prime}-m_{1} v_{1}\\right)+\\left(m_{2} v_{2}^{\\prime}-m_{2} v_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince the action force $F$ is equal and opposite to the reaction force $F^{\\prime}$, we have $F^{\\prime}=-F$, or $F+F^{\\prime}=0$ so the left hand side of the equation is zero. Hence,\n\n$$\n0=\\left(m_{1} v_{1}^{\\prime}-m_{1} v_{1}\\right)+\\left(m_{2} v_{2}^{\\prime}-m_{2} v_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn other words, change in momentum of 1st ball + change in momentum of the $2^{\\text {nd }}$ ball is zero.\nor $\\left(m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}\\right)=\\left(m_{1} v_{1}^{\\prime}+m_{2} v_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)$\nWhen a moving car stops quickly, the passengers move forward towards the windshield. Beatbelts change the forces of motion and prevent the passengers from moving. Thus, the chance of injury is greatly reduced.\n\nWhich means that total initial momentum of the system before collision is equal to the total final momentum of the system after collision. Consequently, the total change in momentum of the isolated two ball system is zero.\nFor such a group of objects, if one object within the group experiences a force, there must exist an equal but opposite reaction force on other object in the same group. As a result, the change in momentum of the group of objects as a whole is always zero. This can be expressed in the form of law of conservation of momentum, which states that:\n\nThe total linear momentum of an isolated system remains constant.\nIn applying the conservation law, we must notice that the momentum of a body is a vector quantity.\n\nExample 2.8 Two spherical balls of 2.0 kg and 3.0 kg masses are moving towards each other with velocities of $6.0 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and $4 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, respectively. What must be the velocity of the smaller ball after collision, if the velocity of the bigger ball is $3.0 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ?\n\nSolution As both the balls are moving towards one another, so their velocities are of opposite sign. Let us suppose that the direction of motion of 2 kg ball is positive and that of the 3 kg is negative.\nThe momentum of the system before collision is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2} & =2 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 8 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}+3 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times\\left(-4 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\right) \\\\\n& =12 \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}-12 \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nA motorcycle's safety helmet is padded so as to extend the time of any collision to prevent serious injury.\n\nMomentum of the system after collision $=m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}^{\\prime}$\n\n$$\n=2 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times v_{1}^{\\prime}+3 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times(-3) \\mathrm{m} \\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nFrom the law of conservation of momentum\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Momentum of the system } \\\\\n& \\text { before collision }\n\\end{aligned} \\quad=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text { Momentum of the system } \\\\\n\\text { after collision }\n\\end{array}\\right] \\\\\n& 0=2 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times v^{\\prime}-9 \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime \\prime} \\\\\n& v_{1}^{\\prime}=4.5 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime \\prime}\n$$\n\n# 2.8 ELASTIC AND INELASTIC COLLISIONS\n\nWhen a tennis ball is dropped on the floor vertically, it may not rebound to its initial height. It is because, a portion of $K . E$. is lost, partly due to friction as the molecules in the ball move past one another when the ball distorts and partly due to its change into heat and sound energies. Similar is the case when two tennis balls collide with certain velocities, their final kinetic energy may be less than the total initial kinetic energy.\n\nA collision in which the K.E. of the system is not conserved, is called inelastic collision.\n\nUnder certain special conditions, no kinetic energy is lost in the collision or impact on hitting the floor. Such type of collision is said to be elastic collision.\n\nFor example, when a hard ball is dropped onto a marble floor, it rebounds to very nearly the initial height. It loses negligible amount of energy in the collision with the floor. It is to be noted that momentum and total energy are conserved in all types of collisions. However, the K.E. is conserved only if it is an elastic collision.\n\n## Elastic Collisions in One Dimension\n\nConsider two smooth, non-rotating balls of masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ moving initially with velocities $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ respectively, in the same direction. They collide and after collision, they move along the same straight line without rotation. Let their velocities after the collision be $\\mathbf{v}^{\\prime}$, and $\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{\\prime}$ respectively, as\nBefore collision shown in Fig.(2.10).\nWe take the positive direction of the velocity and momentum to the right. By applying the law of conservation of momentum we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}\\right)=\\left(m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}\\right) \\\\\n& m_{1}\\left(v_{1}-v_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=m_{2}\\left(v_{2}^{\\prime}-v_{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFig. 2.10\n\nAs the collision is elastic, so the K.E. is conserved. From the conservation of K.E.,\n\n# Physica II\n\nwe have\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2} & =\\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2} \\\\\nm_{1}\\left(v_{1}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\\right) & =m_{2}\\left(v_{2}^{2}-v_{2}^{2}\\right) \\\\\nm_{1}\\left(v_{1}+v_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(v_{1}-v_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=m_{2}\\left(v_{2}^{\\prime}+v_{2}\\right)\\left(v_{2}^{\\prime}-v_{2}\\right) & \\ldots \\ldots . .(2.30)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nDividing Eq. (2.29) by (2.30)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(v_{1}+v_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) & =\\left(v_{2}^{\\prime}+v_{2}\\right) \\\\\n\\left(v_{1}-v_{2}\\right) & =\\left(v_{2}^{\\prime}-v_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=-\\left(v_{1}^{\\prime}-v_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe note that, before collision $\\left(v_{1}-v_{2}\\right)$ is the velocity of first ball relative to the second ball. Similarly $\\left(v_{1}^{\\prime}-v_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is the velocity of the first ball relative to the second ball after collision. It means that relative velocities before and after the collision has the same magnitude but are reversed after the collision. In other words, the magnitude of relative velocity of approach is equal to the magnitude of relative velocity of separation.\nIn equations (2.29) and (2.30) $m_{1}, m_{2}, v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are known quantities. We solve these equations to find the values of $v_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $v_{2}^{\\prime}$ which are unknown. The results are\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v_{1}^{\\prime}=\\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1}^{\\prime}+\\frac{2 m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{2} \\\\\n& v_{2}^{\\prime}=\\frac{2 m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1}^{\\prime}+\\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBefore collision\nThere are some cases of special interest, which are discussed below:\n(i) When $m_{1}=m_{2}$\n\nFrom Eq. (2.32) and (2.33), we find that\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v_{1}^{\\prime}=v_{2} \\\\\n& v_{2}^{\\prime}=v_{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(as shown in Fig. 2.11)\n(ii) When $m_{1}=m_{2}$ and $v_{2}=0$\n\nIn this case, the mass $m_{1}$ be at rest, and $v_{2}=0$, then Eqs. (2.32) and (2.33) give\n\n$$\nv_{1}^{\\prime}=0 ; \\quad v_{2}^{\\prime}=v_{1}\n$$\n\nWhen $m_{1}=m_{2}$ then ball of mass $m_{1}$ after collision will come to a stop and $m_{2}$ will take off with the velocity that $m_{1}$ originally had, as shown in Fig.(2.12). Thus when a billiard ball $m_{1}$, moving on\nFig. 2.11\ncase (II)\nBefore collision\nAfter collision\n\nFig. 2.12\n\na table collides with exactly similar ball $m_{2}$ at rest, the ball $m_{1}$ stops while $m_{2}$ begins to move with the same velocity, with which $m_{1}$ was moving initially.\n(iii) When a light body collides with a massive body at rest\nIn this case initial velocity $v_{2}=0$ and $m_{2} \\gg>m_{1}$. Under these conditions $m_{1}$ can be neglected as compared to $m_{2}$. From Eq. (2.33) and (2.32), we have $v_{1}^{\\prime}=-v_{1}$ and $v_{2}^{\\prime}=0$.\nThe result is shown in Fig.(2.13). This means that $m_{1}$ will bounce back with the same velocity while $m_{2}$ will remain stationary. This fact is used of by the squash player.\n(iv) When a massive body collides with light stationary body\n\nIn this case, $m_{1} \\gg>m_{2}$ and $v_{2}=0$, so $m_{2}$ can be neglected in Eqs.(2.32) and (2.33). This gives $v_{1}^{\\prime} \\approx v_{1}$ and $v_{2}^{\\prime} \\approx 2 v_{1}$. Thus, after the collision, there is practically no change in the velocity of massive body, but the lighter one bounces off in the forward direction with approximately twice the velocity of the incident body, as shown in Fig.(2.14).\n\n# 2.9 INELASTIC COLLISION IN ONE DIMENSION\n\nConsider two bodies having masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, moving with velocities $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, along the same line such that $v_{1}>v_{2}$. In such a case $m_{1}$ is regarded as projectile and $m_{2}$ as target. After time $t$ both the bodies make inelastic collision and stick together. Let their combined mass become $m_{1} \\pm m_{2}$ which moves with final velocity $v_{1}$ after collision.\nSince the collision is perfectly inelastic, the total momentum of balls is conserved. Using law of conservation of momentum.\nTotal momentum of system before collision = Total momentum of the system after collision\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nm_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}=\\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\\right) v_{1} \\\\\nv_{1}=\\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1}+\\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{2}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nWhich gives the common velocity of the body after inelastic collision.\n\nIn a special case when the target $m_{2}$ is at rest, $v_{2}=0$, the above equation becomes:\n\n$$\nv_{1}=\\begin{gathered}\nm_{1} \\\\\nm_{1}+m_{2}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nIt shows that velocity of $m_{1}$ is reduced by the mass ratio i.e., $\\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}$.\n\nExample 2.9 A 70 g ball collides with another ball of mass 140 g . The initial velocity of the first ball is $9 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ to the right while the second ball is at rest. If the collision were perfectly elastic.

Momentum is a vector quantity, we resolve it into its rectangular components and apply the law of conservation of momentum along both axes.\n\n# Momentum conservation along $x$-axis is:\n\nMomentum before collision $=$ momentum after collision\n\n$$\nm_{1} v_{1}+m_{1} v_{2}=m_{1} v_{1}^{\\prime} \\cos \\theta_{1}+m_{1} v_{1}^{\\prime} \\cos \\theta_{2}\n$$\n\nMomentum conservation along $y$-axis:\nMomentum before collision $=$ Momentum after collision\n\n$$\n0=m_{1} v_{1}^{\\prime} \\sin \\theta_{1}-m_{1} v_{2}^{\\prime} \\sin \\theta_{2}\n$$\n\n## Conservation of Energy\n\nKinetic Energy before collision = Kinetic Energy after collision\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2}\n$$\n\nThese equations ( 2.35 to 2.37 ) are useful in solving problems about elastic collisions in two dimensions.\n\n### 2.11 INELASTIC COLLISION IN TWO DIMENSIONS\n\nThe macroscopic collisions are generally inelastic and do not conserve Kinetic energy.\nThe perfect inelastic collision is one in which the colliding objects stick together to make a single mass after collision. Its analysis can be carried out as follows:\nLet us take two balls having masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ moving with velocities, $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, respectively, in a two-dimensional $x y$ plane. Assume that the first body is moving along the $x$-axis while the second body moves in a direction, making an angle $\\theta$ with $x$-axis. Both the bodies collide at the origin as shown in the figure 2.17 .\nFig. 2.17\n\nAfter collision, bodies stick together, having combined mass $M=m_{1}+m_{2}$, which moves with velocity $v_{1}$, making an angle $\\phi$ with $x$-axis.\n\n## Momentum in the $x$-direction:\n\n$$\nm_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2} \\cos \\theta=M v_{1} \\cos \\phi\n$$\n\nMomentum in the $y$-direction:\n\n$$\n0+m_{2} v_{2} \\sin \\theta=M v_{1} \\sin \\phi\n$$\n\nEquation 2.38 and 2.39 can be used to find the final velocity.\n\n## Kinetic Energy\n\nSince collision is inelastic, the kinetic energy of colliding system is not conserved. The loss of kinetic energy is computed as follows:\n\n# Initial Kinetic Energy\n\nThe total initial kinetic energy $K . E_{i}$ of the system before the collision is:\n\n$$\n(K . E)_{i}=\\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{i}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2}\n$$\n\nSince $K . E$. is a scalar quantity, so velocities involving in the formula of $K . E$. does not require to break velocities into their components.\n\n## Final Kinetic Energy\n\nThe total final kinetic energy $K . E_{t}$ after the collision (when the objects stick together) is:\n\n$$\n(K . E)_{r}=\\frac{1}{2} M v_{i}^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $v_{i}$ is magnitude of the final velocity which can be calculated from Eq. (2.41).\n\n## Energy Loss in the Collision\n\nSince the collision is inelastic, there is a loss in kinetic energy, represented by $\\Delta K . E$.\n\n$$\n\\Delta K . E_{i}=(K . E)_{t}-(K . E)_{r}\n$$\n\nThis lost kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat, sound, or in deformation.\n\n## Some examples of an inelastic collision:\n\n(i) When a karate chop breaks a pile of bricks, it's an example of an inelastic collision. In this type of collision, the objects involved don't bounce back after impact. Instead, some of the energy from the strike is absorbed by the bricks, converting into heat, sound, and the force needed to break them. This means the energy goes into breaking the bricks rather than causing the hand to rebound. If the Karate chop is not perfectly vertical and involves some horizontal motion, the momentum transfer and the resulting forces will have both horizontal and vertical components.\n(ii) In a car crash, the collision is an inelastic nature. When the vehicles collide and absorb the impact energy, causing them to crumple and deform. This energy absorption slows down the cars, stopping them from bouncing back. Most of the kinetic energy is lost, turning into heat, sound, and damage to the vehicles.\n(iii) In real-world collisions, a ball and bat show an inelastic behaviour. When the bat hits the ball, some of the kinetic energy is lost because the ball deforms, and energy is also converted into heat and sound. Even though the bat is rigid, it does not transfer energy perfectly and absorbs some energy itself. The ball compresses upon impact, which leads to further energy loss. Consequently, not all of the initial kinetic energy is conserved, making the collision overall an inelastic.\n\n# 2.12 ROCKET PROPULSION\n\nRockets move by expelling burning gas through engines at their rear. The ignited fuel turns to a high pressure gas which is expelled with extremely high velocity from the rocket engines (Fig. 2.18). The rocket gains momentum equal to the momentum of the gas expelled from the engine but in opposite direction. The rocket engines continue to expel gases after the rocket has begun moving and hence rocket continues to gain more and more momentum. So, instead of travelling at steady speed the rocket gets faster and faster so long the engines are operating.\nA rocket carries its own fuel in the form of a liquid or solid hydrogen and oxygen. It can, therefore work at great heights where very little or no air is present. In order to provide enough upward thrust to overcome gravity, a typical rocket consumes about $10000 \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime \\prime}$ of fuel and ejects the burnt gases at speeds of over $4000 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime \\prime}$. In fact, more than $80 \\%$ of the launch mass of a rocket consists of fuel only. One way to overcome the problem of mass of fuel is to make the rocket from several rockets linked together.\nWhen one rocket has done its job, it is discarded leaving others to carry the space cratt further up at ever greater speed.\nIf $m$ is the mass of the gases ejected per second with velocity $v$ relative to the rocket, the change in momentum per second of the ejecting gases is mv. This equals the thrust produced by the engine on the body of the rocket. So, the acceleration 'a' of the rocket is\n\n$$\na=\\frac{m v}{M} \\ldots \\ldots(2.42)\n$$\n\nwhere $M$ is the mass of the rocket. When the fuel in the rocket is burned and ejected, the mass $M$ of rocket decreases and hence the acceleration increases.\nFuel and oxygen mix in the combustion chamber. Hot gases exhaust the chamber at a very high velocity. The gain in momentum of the gases equals the gain in momentum of the rocket. The gas and rocket push against each other and move in opposite directions.\n\n# (1)\n\n## QUESTIONS\n\n## Multiple Choice Questions\n\nTick ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sim}$ ) the correct answer.\n2.1 The angle at which dot product becomes equal to cross product:\n(a) $65^{\\circ}$\n(b) $45^{\\circ}$\n(c) $75^{\\circ}$\n(d) $30^{\\circ}$\n2.2 The projectile gains its maximum height at an angle of:\n(a) $0^{\\circ}$\n(b) $45^{\\circ}$\n(c) $60^{\\circ}$\n(d) $90^{\\circ}$\n2.3 The scalar product of two vectors is maximum if they are:\n(a) perpendicular\n(b) parallel\n(c) at $30^{\\circ}$\n(d) at $45^{\\circ}$\n2.4 The range of projectile is same for two angles which are mutually:\n(a) perpendicular\n(b) supplementary\n(c) complementary\n(d) $270^{\\circ}$\n2.5 The acceleration at the top of a trajectory of projectile is:\n(a) maximum\n(b) minimum\n(c) zero\n(d) $g$\n2.6 Si unit of impulse is:\n(a) $\\mathrm{kg} \\mathrm{m} \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n(b) $\\mathrm{Nm}$\n(c) N s\n(d) $\\mathrm{Nm}^{2}$\n2.7 The rate of change of momentum is:\n(a) force\n(b) impulse\n(c) acceleration\n(d) power\n2.8 As rocket moves upward during its journey, then its acceleration goes on:\n(a) Increasing\n(b) decreasing\n(c) remains same\n(d) it moves with uniform velocity\n2.9 Elastic collision involves:\n(a) loss of energy\n(b) gain of energy\n(c) no gain, no loss of energy\n(d) no relation between energy and elastic collision\n\n## Short Answer Questions\n\n2.1 State right hand rule for two vectors with reference to vector product.\n2.2 Define impulse and show how it is related to momentum.\n2.3 Differentiate between an elastic and an inelastic collision.\n2.4 Show that rate of change in momentum is equal to force applied.

Satellites moving in circular orbits around the Earth, orbital and spin motion of the Earth itself, a car turning around a curved road, and a stone whirled around by a string are the familiar examples. When objects move in circular paths, their direction is continuously changing. Since velocity is a vector quantity, this change of direction means that their velocities are not constant. In this chapter, we will study, circular motion, rotational motion, moment of inertia, angular momentum and the related topics.\n\n# 3.1 ANGULAR MEASUREMENTS\n\nConsider an angle subtended at the centre ' $O$ ' of a circle by an arc 'AB' as shown in Fig. 3.1. If the length of the arc ' $A B$ ' is equal to the radius $r$ ' of the circle, then the angle is called one radian. It is the SI unit of angular measurement and its symbol is \"rad\".\n\n## Angular Displacement\n\nFig. 3.1\n\nConsider the motion of a single particle $P$ of mass $m$ in a circular path of radius $r$. Suppose this motion is taking place by attaching the particle $P$ at the end of a massless rigid rod of length $r$ whose other end is pivoted at the centre $O$ of the circular path, as shown in Fig. 3.2 (a). As the particle is moving on the circular path, the rod OP rotates in the plane of the circle. The axis of rotation passes through the pivot $O$ and is normal to the plane of rotation. Consider a system of axes as shown in Fig. 3.2 (b). The z-axis is taken along the axis of rotation with the pivot $O$ as origin of coordinates. Axes $x$ and $y$ are taken in the plane of rotation. While OP is rotating, suppose at any instant $t$, its position is $\\mathrm{OP}_{1}$, making angle $\\theta$ with $x$-axis. At a later time $t+\\Delta t$, let its position be $\\mathrm{OP}_{2}$ making angle $\\theta+\\Delta \\theta$ with $x$-axis (Fig. 3.2-c).\nFig. 3.2(a)\nFig. 3.2(b)\nFig. 3.2(c)\n\nAngle $\\Delta \\theta$ defines the angular displacement of $O P$ during the time interval $\\Delta t$. For very small values of $\\Delta \\theta$, the angular displacement is a vector quantity.\n\nThe angular displacement $\\Delta \\theta$ is assigned a positive sign when the sense of rotation of OP is counter clock wise.\nThe direction associated with $\\Delta \\theta$ is along the axis of rotation and is given by right hand rule as shown in Fig 3.2 (d) which states that:\n\nGrasp the axis of rotation in right hand with fingers curling in the direction of rotation; the thumb points in the direction of angular displacement.\nFig. 3.2(d)\n\nThree units are generally used to express angular displacement, namely degrees, revolution and radian. Consider an arc of length $S$ of a circle of radius $r$ (Fig. 3.3) which subtends an angle $\\theta$ at the centre of the circle. Its value in radians (rad) is given as:\n\n$$\n\\theta=\\frac{S}{r}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nS=r \\theta \\quad \\text { (where } \\theta \\text { is in radian) }\n$$\n\nIf OP is rotating, the point $P$ covers a distance $S=2 \\pi r$ in one revolution of $P$. In radian, it would be:\n\n$$\n\\frac{S}{r}-\\frac{2 \\pi r}{r}-2 \\pi\n$$\n\nSo\n\n$$\n1 \\text { revolution }=2 \\pi \\mathrm{rad}=360^{\\circ}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text { or } \\quad 1 \\mathrm{rad}=\\frac{360^{\\circ}}{2 \\pi}=57.3^{\\circ}\n$$\n\n# Angular Velocity\n\nVery often, we are interested in knowing how fast or how slow a body is rotating. It is determined by its angular velocity defined as the rate at which the angular displacement is changing with time. Referring to Fig. 3.2(c), if $\\Delta \\theta$ is the angular displacement during the time interval $\\Delta t$, the average angular velocity $\\omega_{0}$ during this interval is given by\n\n$$\n\\omega_{0 r}=\\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nThe instantaneous angular velocity $\\omega$ is the limit of the ratio $\\Delta \\theta / \\Delta t$ as $\\Delta t$, approaches to zero.\n\n$$\n\\text { Thus } \\quad \\omega=\\lim _{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nIn the limit when $\\Delta t$ approaches zero, the angular displacement would be infinitesimally small. So, it would be a vector quantity and the angular velocity as defined by Eq. 3.3 would also be a vector. Its direction is along the axis of rotation and is given by right hand rule as described earlier.\n\nAngular velocity is measured in radians per second which is the SI unit. Sometimes it is also given in terms of revolution per minute (rpm).\n\n## Angular acceleration\n\nWhen we switch on an electric fan, we notice that its angular velocity goes on increasing till it becomes uniform. We say that it has an angular acceleration. We define angular acceleration as the rate of change of angular velocity. If $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{1}$ are the values of instantaneous velocity of a rotating body at instants $t_{1}$ and $t_{r}$, the average angular acceleration during the interval $t_{1}-t_{1}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{0 r}=\\frac{\\omega_{r}-\\omega_{1}}{t_{r}-t_{1}}=\\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nThe instantaneous angular acceleration is the limit of the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{\\Delta t}$ as $\\Delta t$ approaches zero. Therefore, instantaneous angular acceleration $\\alpha$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\lim _{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nThe angular acceleration is also a vector quantity whose magnitude is given by Eq. 3.5 and its direction is along the axis of rotation. Angular acceleration is expressed in rads ${ }^{2}$.\nTill now we have been considering the motion of a particle $P$ on a circular path. The point $P$ was fixed at the end of a rotating massless rigid rod. Now consider the rotation of a rigid body as shown in Fig. 3.4. Imagine a point $P$ on the rigid body. Line $O P$ is the perpendicular dropped from $P$ on the axis of rotation usually referred as the reference line. As the body rotates, line OP also rotates with the same angular velocity and angular acceleration. Thus, the rotation of a rigid body can be described by the rotation of the reference line OP and all the terms that we defined with the help of rotating line OP are also valid for the rotational motion of a rigid body. Henceforth, while dealing with rotation of a rigid body, we will replace it by its reference line OP.\n\n# Relation between Angular and Linear Velocities\n\nConsider a rigid body rotating about $z$-axis with an angular velocity $\\omega$ as shown in Fig. 3.5 (a).\nImagine a point $P$ in the rigid body af a perpendicular distance $r$ from the axis of rotation. OP represents the reference line of the rigid body. As the body rotates, the point $P$ moves along a circle of radius $r$ with a linear velocity $v$ whereas the line OP rotates with angular velocity $\\omega$ as shown in Fig. 3.5 (b). We are interested in finding out the relation between $\\omega$ and $v$. As the axis of rotation is fixed, so the direction of $\\omega$ always remains the same and $\\omega$ can be manipulated as a scalar. As regards the linear velocity of the point $P$, let us consider only its magnitude only which can also be treated as a scalar.\n\n$$\nP_{1} P_{2}=\\Delta S\n$$\n\nSuppose during the course of its motion, the point $P$ moves through a distance $P_{1} P_{2}=\\Delta S$ in a time interval $\\Delta t$ during which reference line OP covers an angular displacement $\\Delta 0$ radian. So, $\\Delta S$ and $\\Delta 0$ are related by Eq. 3.1 as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S=r \\Delta 0\n$$\n\nFig. 3.4\nFig. 3.5(b)\nAs the wheel turns through an angle $\\theta$, it lays out a tangential distance $S=r \\theta$.\n\nDividing both sides by $\\Delta t$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta S}{\\Delta t}=r \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nIn the limit when linear $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$ the ratio $\\Delta S / \\Delta t$ represents $v$, the magnitude of the linear velocity with which point $P$ is moving on the circumference of the circle. Similarly $\\Delta \\theta / \\Delta t$ represents the angular velocity $\\omega$ of the reference line OP So. Eq. 3.6 becomes:\n\n$$\nv=r \\omega\n$$\n\nFrom Fig. 3.5(b), it can be seen that the point $P$ is moving along the arc $\\mathrm{P}_{1} \\mathrm{P}_{2}$. In the limit when $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$, the length of arc $\\mathrm{P}_{1} \\mathrm{P}_{2}$ becomes very small and its direction represents the direction of tangent to the circle at point $P_{1}$. Thus, the velocity with which point $P$ is moving on the circumference of the circle has a magnitude $v$ and its direction is always along the tangent to the circle at that point. That is why the linear velocity of the point $P$ is also known as tangential velocity.\nSimilarly, Eq. 3.7 shows that if the reference line OP is rotating with an angular acceleration $a$, the point $P$ will also have a linear or tangential acceleration $a_{r}$. Using Eq. 3.7 it can be shown that the two accelerations are related by\n\n$$\na_{t}=r \\alpha\n$$\n\nEqs. 3.7 and 3.8 show that on a rotating body, points that are at different distances from the axis do not have the same speed or acceleration, but all points on a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis do have the same angular displacement, angular speed and angular acceleration at any instant. Thus, by the use of angular variables, we can describe the motion of the entire body in a simple way.\n\n# Equations ofAngular Motion\n\nThe equations $(3.2,3.3,3.4$ and 3.5 ) of angular motion are exactly analogous to those in linear motion if $0, \\omega$ and $\\alpha$ be replaced by $S, v$ and $a$, respectively. As the other equations of linear motion were obtained by algebraic manipulation of these equations, it follows that analogous equations will also apply to angular motion. Given below are angular equations together with their linear counterparts.\n\n| Linear Equations | Angular Equations |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| $v_{t}=v_{t}+a t$ | $\\omega_{t}=\\omega_{t}+\\alpha t$ |\n| $2 a S=v_{t}^{2}-v_{t}^{2}$ | $2 \\alpha \\theta=\\omega_{t}^{2}-\\omega_{t}^{2}$ |\n| $S=v_{t} t+\\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ | $\\theta=\\omega_{t} t+\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha t^{2}$ |\n\nThe angular equations 3.9 to 3.11 hold true only in the case when the axis of rotation is fixed, so that all the angular vectors have the same direction. Hence, they can be manipulated as scalars.\n\nExample 3.1 An electric fan rotating at 3 rev s\" is switched off. It comes to rest in 18.0 s . Assuming deceleration to be uniform, find its value. How many revolutions did it tum before coming to rest?\n\nSolution In this problem, we have\n$\\omega_{t}=3.0 \\mathrm{rev} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}, \\quad \\omega_{t}=0, \\quad t=18.0 \\mathrm{~s}$ and $\\alpha=?, \\quad \\theta=$ ?\nFrom Eq. 3.9, we have\n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{\\omega_{r}-\\omega_{t}}{t}=\\frac{(0-3.0) \\mathrm{revs}^{-1}}{18.0 \\mathrm{~s}}=-0.167 \\mathrm{rev} \\mathrm{~s}^{2}\n$$\n\nand from Eq 3.11, we have\n\n$$\n0=\\omega_{t} t+\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha t^{2}\n$$\n\n$=3.0 \\mathrm{rev} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\times 18.0 \\mathrm{~s}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(-0.167 \\mathrm{rev} \\mathrm{s}^{-2}\\right) \\times(18.0 \\mathrm{~s})^{2}$\n$=27$ rev\nDirection of motion changes continuously in circular motion.\n\n# 3.2 CENTRIPETAL FORCE\n\nNewton's second law of motion states that when a force acts on a body, it produces acceleration in the same direction. A force acting on a moving body along the direction of its velocity will change magnitude of the velocity (speed) keeping the direction unchanged. On the other hand, a constant force acting perpendicular to the velocity of a body moving in a circular path will change the direction but magnitude of velocity (speed) will remain the same. Such force makes the body move in a circle by producing a radial (or centripetal) acceleration and is called centripetal force (Centre seeking) force. Figure 3.6(a) shows a ball tied at the end of a string is whirled in a horizontal surface. It would not continue in a circular path if the string is snapped. Careful observation shows at once that if the string snaps, when the ball is at the point $A$, in Fig. 3.6 (b), the ball will follow the\nFig. 3.6(a)\nFig. 3.6(b)\nstraight line path $A B$ which is tangent $A B$ at point $A$.\nThus, a force is needed to change the direction of velocity or motion of a body continuously at each point in circular motion moving with uniform speed. The force that does not alter speed but only direction at each point is a perpendicular force which acts along the radius of the circular path. This force always pulls the object towards the centre\n\nof the circular path. Its direction is perpendicular to the tangential velocity at each point.\nThe force needed to bend the straight path of the particle into a circular path is called the centripetal force.\nFor a body of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ in a circular path of radius $r$, centripetal force $F_{c}$ is given by\n\n$$\nF_{c}=m u_{c}=\\frac{m v^{2}}{r}\n$$\n\nwhere $a=v^{2} / r$ is the centripetal acceleration and its direction is towards the centre of the circle. As $v=r \\omega$, so the above equation becomes:\n\n$$\nF_{c}=m r \\omega^{2}\n$$\n\nExample 3.2 If a CD spins at 210 rpm , what is the radial acceleration of a point on the outer rim of the CD? The CD is 12 cm in diameter.\nSolution We convert 210 rpm into a frequency in revolutions per second $(\\mathrm{Hz})$.\nThus $f=210 \\frac{\\mathrm{rev}}{\\min } \\times \\frac{1}{60} \\frac{\\min }{s}=3.5 \\frac{\\mathrm{rev}}{\\mathrm{s}}=3.5 \\mathrm{~Hz}$\nFor each revolution, the CD rotates through an angle of $2 \\pi$ radians. The angular velocity is:\n\n$$\n\\omega=2 \\pi f=2 \\pi \\mathrm{rad} \\times 3.5 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}=7.0 \\pi \\mathrm{rad} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe radial acceleration is:\n\n$$\na=\\omega^{2} r=\\left(7.0 \\pi \\mathrm{rad} \\mathrm{~s}^{1}\\right)^{2} \\times 0.06 \\mathrm{~m}=29 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}\n$$\n\nExample 2.3 A ball tied to the end of a string, is swung in a vertical circle of radius $r$ under the action of gravity as shown in Fig. 3.7. What will be the tension in the string when the ball is at the point $A$ of the path and its speed is $v$ at this point?\nSolution For the ball to travel in a circle, the force acting on the ball must provide the required centripetal force. In this case, at point $A$, two forces act on the ball, the pull of the string and the weight $w$ of the ball. These forces act along the radius at $A$, and so their vector sum must furnish the required centripetal force. We, therefore, have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& T+w=\\frac{m v^{2}}{r} \\quad \\text { as } w=m g \\text {, therefore. } \\\\\n& \\therefore \\quad T=\\frac{m v^{2}}{r}-m g=m\\left(\\frac{v^{2}}{r}-g\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCurved flight at high speed requires a large centripetal force that makes the stunt dangerous even if the air planes are not so close.\nFig. 3.7\n\nIf $\\frac{v^{2}}{r}=g$, then $T$ will be zero and the centripetal force is just equal to the weight.\n\n# Examples of centripetal force\n\nIn every circular or orbital motion, centripetal force is needed which is provided by some agency.\n\n1. When a ball is whirled in a horizontal circle with the help of a string, then tension in the string provides necessary centripetal force.\n2. For an object placed on a turntable, the friction is the centripetal force.\n3. The gravitational force is the cause of the Earth orbiting around the Sun, Moon and artificial satellites revolving around the Earth.\n4. A normal or perpendicular magnetic force compels a charge particle moving along a straight path into a circular path.\n5. When a vehicle takes turn on a road, it also needs centripetal force which is provided by the friction between the tyres and the road. If the road is slippery, then at high speed, the friction may not be sufficient enough to provided necessary centripetal force.\nBanked tracks are needed for turns that are taken so quickly that friction alone cannot provide energy for centripetal force\n\nHence, vehicle will not be able to take turn and may skid or may even be toppled. To overcome this difficulty, the highway road is banked on turns. That is, the outer edge of the track is kept slightly higher than that of the inner edge.\n\n## Applications of Centripetal Force\n\nWe know that an object moves in a circle because of centripetal force. If the magnitude of applied force falls short of required centripetal force then the object will move away from the centre of the circle. The centrifuge (Fig. 3.8-a) functions on this basic principle.\nCentrifuge: It is one of the most useful laboratory device. It helps to separate out denser and lighter particles from a mixture. The mixture is rotated at high speed for a specific time. In a laboratory setup, sample tubes are used where the denser particles will settle at the bottom and lighter particles will rise to the top of the sample tubes (Fig. 3.8-b).\nThe dryer of the washing machine also functions on the principle of centrifuge. The dryer consists of a long cylinder with hundreds of small holes on its wall. Wet clothes are piled up in this cylinder, which is then rotated rapidly about its axis. Water moves outward to the walls of the cylinder and thus, drained out through the holes. In this way, clothes become dry quickly.\nCream separator is another practical device which is used to separate cream form the milk. In this machine, milk is whirled rapidly. Since milk is a mixture of light and heavy particles, when it is rotated, the light particles gather near the axis of rotation whereas the heavy particles will go outwards and hence, cream can easily be separated from milk.\n\n# 3.3 ARTIFICIAL SATELLITES\n\nSatellites are objects that orbit in nearly circular path around the Earth. They are put into orbit by rockets and are\nFig. 3.10\nheld in orbits by the gravitational pull of the Earth. The low flying Earth satellites have acceleration $9.8 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{2}$ towards the centre of the Earth. If there is no gravitational pull, they would fly off in a straight line along tangent to the orbit. When the satellite is moving in a circle, it has an acceleration $\\vec{v}$. In a circular orbit around the Earth, the centripetal acceleration is supplied by gravity and we have\n\n$$\ng=\\frac{v^{2}}{R}\n$$\n\n(3.14)\nwhere $v$ is the orbital velocity and $R$ is the radius of the Earth $(6400 \\mathrm{~km})$. From Eq. 3.14, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv & =\\sqrt{g R} \\\\\n& -\\sqrt{9.5 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{2}} \\times 6.4 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~m} \\\\\n& =7.9 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}=7.9 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is the minimum velocity necessary to put a satellite into the orbit, called the critical velocity. The period $T$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT & =\\frac{2 \\pi R}{v}=2 \\times 3.14 \\times \\frac{6400 \\mathrm{~km}}{7.9 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{1}} \\\\\n& =5060 \\mathrm{~s}=84 \\mathrm{~min} \\text { approx. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf, however, a satellite in a circular orbit is at a distance $h$ much greater than $R$ above the Earth's surface, we must take into account the experimental fact that the gravitational acceleration decreases inversely as the square of the distance from the centre of the Earth (Fig.3.11).\nThe higher the satellite, the slower will be the required speed and longer it will take to complete one revolution around the Earth.\nFig. 3.11\n\n# Orbital Velocity\n\nFigure 3.12 shows a satellite going round the Earth in a circular path. Let the mass of the satellite be $m_{s}$ and $v$ is its orbital speed. The mass of the Earth is $M$ and $r$ represents the radius of the orbit. A centripetal force $m_{s} v^{2} / r$ is required to hold the satellite in the orbit. This force is provided by the gravitational force of attraction between the Earth and the satellite. Equating the gravitational force to the required centripetal force, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{G m_{s} M}{r^{2}}=\\frac{m_{s} v^{2}}{r}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nv=\\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}\n$$\n\nThis shows that the mass of the satellite is unimportant in describing the satellite's orbit. Thus, any satellite orbiting at distance $r$ from the Earth's centre must have the orbital speed given by Eq. 3.15. Any speed less than this will bring the satellite tumbling back to the Earth.\n\n## Example 3.6\n\nAn Earth satellite is in circular orbit at distance of $384,000 \\mathrm{~km}$ from the Earth's surface. What is its period of one revolution in days? Take mass of the Earth $M=6.0 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{~kg}$ and its radius $R=6400 \\mathrm{~km}$.\n\n## Solution\n\nAs $\\quad r=R+h=(6400+384000) \\mathrm{km}=390400 \\mathrm{~km}$\n\nUsing $v=\\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~N} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\mathrm{~kg}^{-2} \\times 6 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{~kg}}{390400 \\mathrm{~km}}}$\n\nAlso\n\n$$\nT=\\frac{2 \\pi R}{V}=2 \\times 3.14 \\times 390400 \\mathrm{~km} \\times \\frac{1}{1.025 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{1}} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{day}}{60 \\times 60 \\times 24 \\mathrm{~s}}\n$$\n\n## Weightlessness in Satellites\n\nWhen a satellite is launched by a rocket in its desired orbit around the Earth, then it has been observed practically that everything inside the satellite experiences weightlessness because the satellite is accelerating towards the centre of the Earth as a freely falling body.\nThe moment you switch on your mobile phone, your location can be tracked immediately by global positioning system.\nIn 1984, at a height of 100 km above Hawaii Island with a speed of $29000 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~h}^{1}$ Bruce McCandless stepped into space from a space shuttle and became the first human satellite of the Earth.\n\n## Your weight slightly changes when the velocity of the elevator changes at the start and end of a ride, not during the rest of the ride when that velocity is constant.\n\nConsider a satellite of mass $M$ revolving in its orbit of radius $r$ around the Earth. A body of mass $m$ inside the satellite suspended by a spring balance from the ceiling of the satellite is under the action of two forces. That is, its weight mg acting downward, while the supporting force, called normal force $F_{n}$ or tension in the spring acting upward, as shown in Fig. 3.13. Their resultant force is equal to the centripetal force required by the mass $m$ which is acting towards the centre of the Earth, and is expressed as:\n\n$$\nF_{c}=m g-F_{n}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nF_{c}=\\frac{m v^{2}}{r}\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\n\\frac{m v^{2}}{r}=m g-F_{n}\n$$\n\nWhen a bucket full of water is rapidly whited in a vertical circular peth, water does not fall out even if the bucket is invarted at the maximum height. Why is it so?\n\nIt may be noted that the centripetal force responsible for the revolution of the satellite of mass $M$ around the Earth is provided by the gravitational force of attraction between the Earth and the satellite.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_{g} & =F_{n} \\\\\nM g & =\\frac{M v^{2}}{r} \\\\\ng & =\\frac{v^{2}}{r}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, Eq. 3.16(a) becomes:\nor\n\n$$\nm g=m g-F_{n}\n$$\n\nAstronaut floating inside the cabin of a spaceship.\n\nThis shows that the supporting force which is acting on a body inside the satellite is zero. Therefore, the bodies as well as the astronauts in a satellite find themselves in a state of apparent weightlessness.\n\n# Artificial Gravity\n\nIn a gravity free space, there will be no force that will push anybody to any side of the spacecraft. If this spacecraft is to stay in the orbit over an extended period of time, the weightlessness may affect the performance of the astronauts present in that spacecraft. To overcome this difficulty, an artificial gravity can be created in the spacecraft. This could enable the crew of the space ships to function in an almost normal manner. For this situation to prevail, the spaceship is set into rotation around its own axis. The astronaut then is pressed towards the outer rim and exerts a force on the 'floor' of the spaceship in much the same way as on the Earth.\nConsider a spacecraft of the shape as shown in Fig. 3.14. The outer radius of the\n\nspaceship is $R$ and it rotates around its own central axis with angular speed $\\omega$, then its angular acceleration $a_{c}$ is\n\n$$\na_{c}=R \\omega^{2}\n$$\n\nBut $\\omega=\\frac{2 \\pi}{t}$ where $t$ is the period of revolution of spaceahip\nHence\n\n$$\na_{c}=R \\frac{(2 \\pi)^{2}}{t^{2}}=R \\frac{4 \\pi^{2}}{t^{2}}\n$$\n\nAs frequency $f=1 / t$, therefore,\n\n$$\na_{c}=R 4 \\pi^{2} f^{2}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nf^{2}=\\frac{a_{c}}{4 \\pi^{2} R} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad f=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{a_{c}}{R}}\n$$\n\nAs described above, the force of gravity provides the required centripetal acceleration, therefore,\n\n$$\na_{c}=g\n$$\n\nSo\n\n$$\nf=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{R}}\n$$\n\nWhen the spaceship rotates with this frequency, the artificial gravity like the Earth is provided to the inhabitants of the spaceship.\n\n# 3.4 MOMENT OF INERTIA\n\nConsider a mass $m$ attached to the end of a massless rod as shown in Fig. 3.15. Assume that the bearing at the pivot point $O$ is frictionless. Let the system be in a horizontal plane. A force $F$ is acting on the mass perpendicular to the rod and hence, this will accelerate the mass according to:\n\n$$\nF=m a\n$$\n\nIn doing so, the force will cause the mass to rotate about $O$. Since tangential acceleration $a_{T}$ is related to angular acceleration $\\alpha$ by the equation.\n\n$$\na_{1}=r \\alpha\n$$\n\nSo\n\n$$\nF=m r \\alpha\n$$\n\nThe surface of the rotating space-ship pushes on an object with which it is in contact and thereby provides the centripetal force needed to keep the object moving on a circular path.\nFig. 3.15\nThe force $F$ causes a torque about the axis $O$ and gives the mass $m$ an angular acceleration $\\alpha$ about the pivot point.\n\nAs turning effect is produced by torque $\\tau$, it would, therefore, be better to write the equation for rotation in terms of torque. This can be done by multiplying both sides of the above equation by $r$. Thus,\n\n$$\nr F=\\tau=\\text { torque }=m r^{2} \\alpha\n$$\n\nwhich is rotational analogue of the Newton's second law of motion, $F=m a$.\nHere $F$ is replaced by $\\tau$, a by $\\alpha$ and $m$ by $m r^{2}$. The quantity $m r^{2}$ is known as the moment\n\nof inertia and is represented by $I$. The moment of inertia plays the same role in anguler motion as the mass in linear motion. It may be noted that moment of inertia depends not only on mass $m$ but also on $r^{2}$.\nMost rigid bodies have different mass concentration at different distances from the axis of rotation, which means the mass distribution is not uniform. As shown in Fig. 3.16(a), the rigid body is made up of $n$ small pieces of masses $m_{1}, m_{2}, \\ldots$ at distances $r_{1}, r_{2}, \\ldots$ from the axis of rotation $O$. Let the body be rotating with the angular acceleration $\\alpha$, so the magnitude of the torque acting on $m_{1}$ is\n\n$$\n\\tau_{1}=m_{1} r_{1}^{2} \\alpha_{1}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the torque on $m_{2}$ is\n\n$$\n\\tau_{2}=m_{2} r_{2}^{2} \\alpha_{2}\n$$\n\nFig. 3.16\nEach small piece of mass within a large, rigid body undergoes the same angular acceleration about the pivot point.\nSince the body is rigid, so all the masses are rotating with the same angular acceleration $\\alpha$.\nTotal torque $\\tau_{\\text {total }}$ is then given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\tau_{\\text {total }} & =\\left(m_{1} r_{1}^{2}+m_{2} r_{2}^{2}+\\ldots+m_{n} r_{n}^{2}\\right) \\alpha \\\\\n& =\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} r_{i}^{2}\\right) \\alpha\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\tau=I \\alpha\n$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the moment of inertia of the body and is expressed as\n\n$$\nI=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} r_{i}^{2}\n$$\n\n# 3.5 ANGULAR MOMENTUM\n\nWe have already seen that linear momentum plays an important role in translational motion of bodies. Similarly, another quantity known as angular momentum has important role in the study of rotational motion.\n\n## A particle is said to possess an angular momentum about a reference axis if it so moves that its angular position changes relative to that reference axis.\n\nThe angular momentum $\\mathbf{L}$ of a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ and momentum $p$ (Fig. 3.17) relative to the origin $O$ is defined as:\n\n$$\nL=r x p\n$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the position vector of the particle at that instant relative to the origin $O$. Angular momentum is a vector quantity. Its magnitude is:\n\n$$\nL=r p \\sin \\theta=m r v \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between $r$ and $p$. The direction of $L$ is perpendicular to the plane formed by $r$ and $p$ and its sense is given by the right hand rule of vector product. SI unit of angular momentum is $\\mathrm{kg} \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ or J s .\nIf the particle is moving in a circle of radius $r$ with uniform angular velocity $\\omega$, then angle between $r$ and tangential velocity is $90^{\\circ}$. Hence,\n\n$$\nL=m r v \\sin 90^{\\circ}=m r v\n$$\n\nBut\n\n$$\nv=r \\omega \\quad \\text { Hence } \\quad L=m r^{2} \\omega\n$$\n\nNow consider a symmetric rigid body rotating about a fixed axis through the centre of mass as shown in Fig 3.18. Each particle of the rigid body rotates about the same axis in a circle with an angular velocity $\\omega$. The magnitude of the angular momentum of the particle of mass $m_{t}$ is $m_{t} v_{t} r_{t}$ about the origin $O$. The direction of $L$ is the same as that of $\\omega$. Since $v_{t}=r_{t} \\omega$, the angular momentum of the th particle is $m_{t} r_{t}^{2} \\omega$. Summing this over all particles gives the total angular momentum of the rigid body.\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{L}=\\left(\\sum_{t=1}^{N} m_{t} r_{t}^{2}\\right) \\omega=l \\omega\n$$\n\nwhere $l$ is the moment of inertia of the rigid body about the axis of rotation.\nFig. 3.17\n(a)\n(b)\n\nThe sphere in (a) is rotating in the sense given by the gold arrow. Its angular velocity and angular momentum are taken to be upward along the rotational axis, as shown by the right-hand rule in (b).\nFig. 3.18\n\n# 3.5\n\nThe mass of Earth is $6.00 \\times 10^{34} \\mathrm{~kg}$. The distance $r$ from Earth to the Sun is $1.50 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{~m}$. As seen from the direction of the North Star, the Earth revolves counter-clockwise around the Sun. Determine the orbital angular momentum of the Earth about the Sun, assuming that it traverses a circular orbit about the Sun once a year ( $3.16 \\times 10^{\\prime}$ s).\nSolution To find the Earth's orbital angular momentum, we must first know its orbital speed from the given data. When the Earth moves around a circle of radius $r$, it travels a distance of $2 \\pi r$ in one year. Its orbital speed $v_{0}$ is thus, $v_{0}=\\frac{2 \\pi r}{t}$ Orbital angular momentum of the Earth $=L_{x}=m v_{0} r$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nL & =\\frac{2 \\pi r^{2} m}{t} \\\\\n& =\\frac{2 \\pi\\left(1.60 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)^{2} \\times\\left(6.00 \\times 10^{34} \\mathrm{~kg}\\right)}{3.16 \\times 10^{\\prime} \\mathrm{s}} \\\\\nL & =2.67 \\times 10^{40} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe sign is positive because the revolution is counter clockwise.\n\n### 3.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM\n\nThe law of conservation of angular momentum states that if no external torque acts on a system, the total angular momentum of the system remains constant.\n\n$$\nL_{\\text {sita }}=L_{1}+L_{2}+\\ldots=\\text { constant }\n$$\n\nThe law of conservation of angular momentum is one of the fundamental principles of Physics. It has been verified from the cosmological to the sub microscopic level. The effect of the law of conservation of angular momentum is readily apparent if a single isolated spinning body alters its moment of inertia.\n\nIf a body of moment of inertia $I_{1}$ spinning with angular speed $\\omega_{1}$ alters its moment of inertia to $I_{2}$, then its angular speed $\\omega_{2}$ also changes so that its angular momentum remains constant.\nHence\n\n$$\nI_{1} \\omega_{1}=I_{2} \\omega_{2}\n$$\n\nThe angular momentum is a vector quantity with direction along the axis of rotation. Hence, the direction of angular momentum along the axis of rotation also remains fixed. This is illustrated by the fact given below:\n\nThe axis of rotation of an object will not change its orientation unless an external torque causes it to do so.\n\n## If you try to sit on a bike at rest, it fails. But if the bike is moving, the angular momentum of the spinning wheel resists any tendency to change and heips to keep the bike upright and stable.\nThe ball's speed increases as the string wraps around the finger.\n\nThis fact is of great importance for the Earth as it moves around the Sun. No other sizeable torque is experienced by the Earth, because the major force acting on it is the pull of the Sun. The Earth's axle of rotation, therefore, remains fixed in one direction with reference to the universe around us.\n\n# Examples of conservation of angular momentum\n\nAman diving from a diving board\nA diver jumping from a springboard has to take a few someraaults in air before touching the water surface, as shown in Fig.3.19. After leaving the springboard, he curls his body by rolling arms and legs in. Due to this, his moment of inertia decreases, and he spins in midair with a large angular velocity. When he is about to touch the water surface, he stretches out his arms and legs. He enters the water at a gentle speed and gets a smooth dive. This is an example of the law of conservation of angular momentum.\n\n## The spinning ice skater\n\nAn ice skater as shown in Fig. 3.20 can increase his angular velocity by folding arms and bringing the stretched leg close to the other leg. By doing so, he decreases his moment of inertia. As a result, angular speed increases. When he stretches his hands and a leg outward, the moment of inertia increases and hence angular velocity decreases.\n\n## A person holding some weight in his hands standing on a turntable.\n\nA person is standing on a turntable with heavy mass (dumb-bell) in his hands stretohed out on both sides as shown in Fig. 3.21. As he draws his hands inward, his\nFig. 3.21\nMan with masses in his hands on a turntable. Conservation of angular momentum requires that as the man pulls his arms in, the angular velocity increases.\nFig. 3.19\nA man diving from a diving board.\nFig. 3.20\nAn ice skater using angular momentum\n\n## It has been noticed that when ice on the polar caps of Earth melts and water flows away in the form of river; the moment of inertia of water and hence that of Earth about its axis of rotation increases due to conservation of angular momentum. Hence, the angular velocity of Earth will decrease, therefore, the duration of day increases slightly.\n\nangular speed at once increases. This is because the moment of inertia decreases on drawing the hands inwards, which increases the angular speed.\n\n# Flywheel\n\nFlywheel is a mechanical device which consists of a heavy wheel with an axle (Fig. 3.22). It is used to store rotational energy, smooth out output fluctuations and provides stability in a wide range of applications such as bicycles and other vehicles, industrial machinery, gyroscopes, ships and spacecrafts.\n\n## The flywheel called the balance wheel regulates the time keeping mechanism in mechanical clocks and watches by maintaining controlled oscillations rate.\n\nFig. 3.22: A flywheel\nWhen a fly wheel spins, its angular momentum resists changes to its orientations, maintaining stability. This is useful in systems that need precise control over their orientation without external interference.\n\n## The Gyroscope\n\nAgyroscope is a device which is used to maintain its orientation relative to the Earth's axis or resists changes in its orientation. It consists of a mounted flywheel pivoted in supporting rings as shown in Fig. 3.23. It works on the basis of law of conservation of angular momentum due to its large moment of inertia. When the gyroscope spins at a large angular speed, it gains large angular momentum. It is then difficult to change the orientation of the gyroscope's rotational axis due to its large moment of inertia. A change in orientation requires a change in its angular momentum. To change the direction of a large angular momentum, a corresponding large torque is required. Even if gyroscope is tilted (Fig. 3.24), it still keeps levitated without falling. Hence, it is a reason why a gyroscope can be used to maintain orientation. The\nWhy does the coasting rotating system slow down so water drips into the beaker?\nFig. 3.23: The gryscope\nFig. 3.24\n\nmain applications of gyroscope are in the guiding system of aeroplanes, submarines and space vehicles in order to maintain a specific direction in space to keep steady course.\n\nPlanets move around the Sun in elliptical orbits with Sun situated at one of its foci, thus, distance of a planet from the Sun is not constant when it is nearer the Sun. Its orbital velocity increases automatically.

In Physics, however, the termwork involves two things (i) force, and (ii) displacement. We shall begin with a simple situation in which work is done by a constant force.\n\n### 4.1 WORK DONE BY A CONSTANT FORCE\n\nLet us consider an object which is being pulled by a constant force $F$. The force displaces the object through a displacement $d$ in the direction of force. In such a case, work $W$ is defined as the product of the magnitude of the force $F$ and magnitude of the displacement d. This can be written as:\n\n$$\nW=F d\n$$\n\nEquation (4.1) shows that if the displacement is zero, no work is done even if a large force is applied. For example, pushing on a wall may tire your muscles, but work done is zero as shown in Fig. 4.1.\nThe force applied on a body may not always be in the direction of force as shown in Fig. (4.2). If the force $F$ makes an angle 0 with the displacement $d$ (Fig. 4.3), the work done is equal to the product of the component of force along the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of displacement. Then\nFig. 4.2\n\nFrom the definition of work, we find that:\n(i) Work is a scalar quantity.\n(ii) If $\\theta<90^{\\circ}$, work is done and it is said to be positive work.\n(iii) If $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$, no work is done.\n(iv) If $\\theta>90^{\\circ}$, the work done is said to be negative.\n(v) Sl unit of work is N m , also known as joule (J).\n\n# 4.2 WORKDONE BYAVARIABLEFORCE\n\nIn many cases, the force does not remain constant during the process of doing work. For example, as a rocket moves away from the Earth, work is done against the force of gravity, which varies as the inverse square of the distance from the Earth's centre. Similarly, the force exerted by a spring increases with the amount of stretch. How can we calculate the work done in such situations?\n\nFigure 4.5 shows the path of a particle in the $x y$ plane as it moves from point $P$ to point $Q$. The path has been divided into $n$ short intervals of displacements $\\Delta d_{1}, \\Delta d_{2}, \\ldots \\ldots, \\Delta d_{n}$ and $F_{1}, F_{2}, \\ldots \\ldots, F_{n}$ are the forces acting during these intervals, respectively.\n\nDuring each small interval, the force is supposed to be approximately constant. So, the work done for the first interval can then be written as\n$\\Delta W_{1}=\\mathbf{F}_{1} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{d}_{1}=F_{1} \\cos \\theta_{1} \\Delta d_{1}$\nand in the second interval\n$\\Delta W_{2}=F_{2} \\cdot \\Delta d_{2}=F_{2} \\cos \\theta_{2} \\Delta d_{2}$\nand so on. The total work done in moving the object can be calculated by adding all these terms.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nW_{\\text {total }} & =\\Delta W_{1}+\\Delta W_{2}+\\ldots \\ldots+\\Delta W_{n} \\\\\n& =F_{1} \\cos \\theta_{1} \\Delta d_{1}+F_{2} \\cos \\theta_{2} \\Delta d_{2}+\\ldots \\ldots+F_{n} \\cos \\theta_{n} \\Delta d_{n} \\\\\n\\text { or } \\quad W_{\\text {total }} & =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i} \\cos \\theta_{i} \\Delta d_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe can examine this graphically by plotting $F \\cos \\theta$ verses $d$ as shown in Fig. 4.6. The displacement $d$ has been sub-divided into the same $n$ equal Intervals. The value of $F \\cos \\theta$ at the beginning of each interval is indicated in the figure.\nFig. 4.5\nA particle acted upon by a variable force, moves along the path shown from point $P$ to point $Q$.\nFig. 4.6\n\nNow the $i^{\\text {th }}$ shaded rectangle has an area $F_{i} \\cos \\theta_{i} \\Delta d$ which is the work done during the $i^{\\text {th }}$ interval. Thus, the work done given by Eq. 4.4 equals the sum of the areas of all the rectangles. If we sub-divide the distance into a large number of intervals so that each $\\Delta d$ becomes very small, the work done given by Eq. 4.4 becomes more accurate. If we let each $\\Delta d$ to approach zero, then we obtain an exact result for the work done, such as:\n\n$$\nW_{\\text {total }}=\\underset{\\Delta d \\rightarrow 0}{\\text { Limit }} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i} \\cos \\theta_{i} \\Delta d_{i}\n$$\n\nIf this limit $\\Delta d$ approaches zero, the total area of all the rectangles (Fig. 4.6) approaches the area between the $F \\cos \\theta$ verses $d$ curve and $x$-axis from P to Q as shown shaded in Fig. 4.7.\nThus, the work done by a variable force in moving a particle between two points is equal to the area under the $F \\cos \\theta$ verses $d$ curve between the two points $P$ and $Q$ as shown in Fig. 4.7.\nFig. 4.7\n\nExample 4.3 A force $F$ acting on an object varies with distance $d$ as shown in Fig. 4.8. Calculate the work done by the force as the object moves from $d=0$ to $d=6 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nSolution The work done by the force is equal to the total area under the curve from $d=0$ to $d=6 \\mathrm{~m}$. This area is equal to the area of the rectangular section from $d=0$ to\n\n$d=4 \\mathrm{~m}$, plus the area of triangular section from $d=4 \\mathrm{~m}$ to $d=6 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nHence\nWork done represented by the area of rectangle $=4 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~N}$\n$=20 \\mathrm{Nm}=20 \\mathrm{~J}$\nWork done represented by the area of triangle $=\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~N}$\n$=5 \\mathrm{Nm}=5 \\mathrm{~J}$\nTherefore, the total work done\n$=20 \\mathrm{~J}+5 \\mathrm{~J}=25 \\mathrm{~J}$\n\n# 4.3 CONSERVATIVE AND NON-CONSERVATIVE FORCES\n\n## Conservative Forces\n\nThe space around the Earth In which its gravitational force acts on a body is called the gravitational field. When an object is moved in the gravitational field, the work is done by the gravitational force. If displacement is in the direction of gravitational force, the work is positive. If the displacement is against the gravitational force, the work is said to be negative.\nThere is an interesting property of the gravitational force that when an object is moved from one place to another, the work done by the gravitational force does not depend on the choice of the path. Let us explore it. Consider an object of mass $m$ being displaced with constant speed from point $A$ to $B$ along various paths in the presence of a gravitational force (Fig. 4.9). In this case, the gravitational force is equal to the weight\nFig. 4.9\n$m g$ of the object.\nThe work done by the gravitational force along the path 1 (ADB) can be split into two parts (path AD and path DB). The work done along AD is zero, because the weight mg is perpendicular to this path, whereas the work done along DB is ( $-m g h$ ) because the direction of $m g$ is opposite to that of the displacement i.e., $\\theta=180^{\\circ}$. Hence, the work done in displacing a body from $A$ to $B$ through path 1 is:\n\n$$\nW_{\\text {ace }}=0+(-m g h)=-m g h\n$$\n\nIf we consider the path 2 (ACB), the work done along AC is also (-mgh). Since the work done along CB is zero, therefore,\n\n$$\nW_{\\text {ace }}=-m g h+0=-m g h\n$$\n\nNow consider path 3, i.e., a curved one. Imagine the curved path to be broken down into a\n\nseries of horizontal and vertical steps as shown in Fig. 4.10. There is no work done along the horizontal steps, because $m g$ is perpendicular to the displacement for these steps. Work is done by the force of gravity only along the vertical displacements. During the segment CD, $m g$ is not negative; it is positive. But here all $\\Delta y$ elements are negative, so the products of $m g$ and $\\Delta y$ for all the elements will again be negative. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$\nW_{A B}=-m g\\left(\\Delta y_{1}+\\Delta y_{2}+\\Delta y_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots+\\Delta y_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nAs\n\n$$\n\\Delta y_{1}+\\Delta y_{2}+\\Delta y_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots+\\Delta y_{n}=h\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\nW_{A B}=-m g h\n$$\n\nFig. 4.10\nA smooth path may be replaced by a series of infinitesimal $x$ and $y$ displacements. Work is done only during the $y$ displecements.\n\nThe net amount of work done along the curved path $A B$ is still (-mgh). We conclude from the above discussion that:\n\n# Work done by gravitational force is independent of the path followed.\n\nCan you prove that the work done, along a closed path, such as ACBA or ADBA (Fig. 4.9), by the gravitational force is zero?\n\nIf the work done by a force in moving an object between two points is independent of the path followed or the work done in a closed path be zero, the force is called a conservative force.\nAs shown above, the gravitational force is a conservative force, other examples of conservative force are electrostatic force and elastic spring force.\n\n## Non-Conservative Forces\n\nAll types of forces are not conservative forces.\nA force is non-conservative if the work done by it in moving an object between two points or in a closed path depends on the path of motion.\nThe kinetic frictional force is a non-conservative force. When an object slides over a surface, the kinetic frictional force always acts opposite to the motion and does negative work equal in magnitude to the frictional force multiplied by the length of the path. Thus, greater amount of work is done over a longer path between any two points. Hence, the work depends on the choice of path. Moreover, the total work done by a nonconservative force in a closed path is notzero.\nOther examples of non-conservative force are air resistance, tension in a string, normal force and propulsion force of a rocket.\n\n### 4.4 POWER\n\nIn the definition of work, it is not clear, whether the same amount of work is done in one second or in one hour. The rate, at which work is done, is often of interest in practical applications.\n\n# Piyalue\n\nPower is the measure of the rate at which work is being done.\nIf work $\\Delta W$ is done in a time interval $\\Delta t$, then the average power $P_{w}$ during the interval $\\Delta t$ is defined as:\n\n$$\nP_{w}=\\frac{\\Delta W}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nIf work is expressed as a function of time, the instantaneous power $P$ at any instant is defined as:\n\n$$\nP=\\operatorname{Limit}_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\Delta W}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta W$ is the work done in short interval of time $\\Delta t$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Since } \\\\\n& \\Delta W=F \\cdot \\Delta d \\\\\n& \\text { Hence } \\\\\n& P=\\frac{F \\cdot \\Delta d}{\\Delta t}=F \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta d}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n& \\text { Since } \\\\\n& \\frac{\\Delta d}{\\Delta t}=v \\\\\n& \\text { Hence } \\\\\n& P=F \\cdot v\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, power may also be defined as the scaler product of $F$ and $V$.\nThe SI unit of power is watt, defined as one joule of work done in one second.\nSometimes, for example, in the electrical measurements, the unit of work is expressed as watt second. However, a commercial unit of electrical energy is kilowatt-hour.\nOne kilowatt- hour is the work done in one hour by an agency whose power is one kilowatt.\nTherefore\n\n$$\n1 \\mathrm{kWh}=1000 \\mathrm{~W} \\times 3600 \\mathrm{~s}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n1 \\mathrm{kWh}=3.6 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~J}=3.6 \\mathrm{MJ}\n$$\n\nFor your information\nApproximate Powers\nDevice Power (W)\n\n| Jumbo Jet Aircraft | $1.3 \\times 10^{4}$ |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Car at 90 km h | $1.1 \\times 10^{4}$ |\n| Electric heater | $2 \\times 10^{4}$ |\n| Coloured TV | 120 |\n| Flash light (two cells) | 1.5 |\n| Pocket calculator | $7.9 \\times 10^{4}$ |\n\nExample 4.2 A 70 kg man runs up a long flight of stairs in 4.0 s .

There are two basic forms of energy:\n\n# Physics II\n\n(i) Kinetic energy\n(ii) Potential energy\n\nKinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body due to its motion and potential energy is the energy possessed by a body due to its changed position.\nThe kinetic energy and the potential energy both are the kinds of mechanical energy.\n\n## Kinetic Energy\n\nLet us derive a formula for the kinetic energy of a moving body. Consider a car running with a constant speed on a road. If its engine is switched OFF, it will still cover some distance before stopping. As long as it is moving, it is doing work against the force of friction of the road. In other words, during this interval, it will exert a force equal in magnitude to the force of friction $f$. Let the distance travelled before coming to rest be $d$, then the work done by the car would be $f d$. This work is done by the car due to its motion. The ability of a body to do work due to its motion is its kinetic energy. Therefore, kinetic energy of the car is equal to $f d$. The acceleration can be found by using Newton's second law of motion, i.e.,\n\n$$\nF=m a\n$$\n\nAs the car slows down and finally stops, its acceleration a is negative because it is produced by force of friction $f$ acting apposite to the direction of motion. Thus,\n\n$$\nf=-m a\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\na=-\\frac{f}{m}\n$$\n\nWe can now determine the value of $(f d)$ by using the third equation of motion, i.e;\n\n$$\n2 a S=v^{2}-v^{2}\n$$\n\nHere, Initial velocity $\\quad v_{i}=v$\nFinal velocity $\\quad v_{f}=0$\nDistance $\\quad S=d$\nAcceleration $\\quad a=-\\frac{f}{m}$\nPutting values in the above equation of motion, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 \\times\\left(\\frac{-f}{m}\\right) d & =0-v^{2} \\\\\nf d & =\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs $f d$ is equal to the kinetic energy of body, therefore,\n\n$$\n\\text { Kinetic energy }=\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}\n$$\n\nSince, kinetic energy is equal to work which the body is capable of doing, so the unit of kinetic energy must be that of work, i.e. joule (J).\nExample 4.3 A car weighing 18620 N is running with a speed of $16 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. Brakes are applied and it is brought to rest in a distance of 60 m . Determine the average force of\n\nfriction acting on it.\n\n# Solation\n\nGiven that $\\quad v=16 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}, d=80 \\mathrm{~m}, w=18620 \\mathrm{~N}$ and $f=$ ?\nThe kinetic energy of the car is equal to the work done by it before stopping, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=f d\n$$\n\nHere\n\n$$\nm=\\frac{w}{g}=\\frac{18620 \\mathrm{~N}}{9.8 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}}=1900 \\mathrm{~kg}\n$$\n\nPutting the value in the above equation, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1900 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times\\left(16 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\right)^{2}=f \\times 80\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nf=3040 \\mathrm{~N}\n$$\n\n## Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy is possessed by a body because of its position in a force field, e.g. gravitational field or because of its constrained state.\nThe energy stored in a compressed spring is the potential energy possessed by the spring due to its compressed or stretched state. This form of energy is called the elastic potential energy.\n\n## Absolute Potential Energy\n\nThe absolute gravitational potential energy of an object at a certain position is the work done by the gravitational force in displacing the object from that position to infinity where the force of gravity becomes zero.\nThe relation for the calculation of the work done by the gravitational force or potential energy is $m g h$, which is true only near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational force is nearly constant. But if the body is displaced through a large distance in space, let it be from point 1 to N (Fig. 4.11) in the gravitational field, then the gravitational force will not remain constant, since it varies inversely to the square of the distance.\nIn order to overcome this difficulty, we divide the distance between points 1 and N into small steps each of length $\\Delta r$ so that the value of the force remains constant for each small step. Hence, the total work done can be calculated by adding the work done during all these steps. If $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are the\nFig. 4.11\ndistances of points 1 and 2 respectively, from the centre $O$ of the Earth (Fig. 4.11.), the\n\nwork done during the first step i.e., displacing a body from point 1 to point 2 can be calculated as below. The distance between the centre of this step and centre of the Earth will be:\n\n$$\nr=\\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{2}\n$$\n\nAs\n\n$$\nr_{2}-r_{1}=\\Delta r \\quad \\text { then } \\quad r_{2}=r_{1}+\\Delta r\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\nr=\\frac{r_{1}+r_{1}+\\Delta r}{2}=r_{1}+\\frac{\\Delta r}{2}\n$$\n\nThe gravitational force $F$ at the centre of this step is:\n\n$$\nF=G \\frac{M m}{r^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $m=$ mass of an object, $M=$ mass of the Earth and $G=$ Gravitational constant\nSquaring Eq. 4.10\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& r^{2}=\\left(r_{1}+\\frac{\\Delta r}{2}\\right)^{2} \\\\\n& r^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+2 r_{1} \\frac{\\Delta r}{2}+\\left(\\frac{\\Delta r}{2}\\right)^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThere is more energy reaching Earth in 10 days of sunlight than in all the fossil fuels on the Earth.\n\nAs $(\\Delta r)^{2} \\ll r_{1}{ }^{2}$, so $(\\Delta r)^{2}$ can be neglected as compared to $r_{1}{ }^{2}$.\nHence\n\n$$\nr^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+r_{1} \\Delta r\n$$\n\nPutting the value of $\\Delta r=r_{2}-r_{1}$\n\n$$\nr^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+r_{1}\\left(r_{1}-r_{1}\\right)=r_{1} r_{2}\n$$\n\nHence, Eq. 4.11 becomes\n\n$$\nF=G \\frac{M m}{r_{1} r_{2}}\n$$\n\nAs this force is assumed to be constant during the interval $\\Delta r$, so the work done is:\n\n$$\nW_{1} \\rightarrow_{2}=F \\Delta r=F \\Delta r \\cos 180^{\\circ}=-G M m \\frac{\\Delta r}{r_{1} r_{2}}\n$$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the work has to be done on the body from point 1 to 2 because displacement is opposite to gravitational force. Putting the value of $\\Delta r$, we have\n\n$$\nW_{1}>_{2}=-G M m \\frac{r_{2}-r_{1}}{r_{1} r_{2}}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nW_{1} \\rightarrow_{2}=-G M m\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\\frac{1}{r_{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the work done during the second step in which the body is displaced from point 2 to 3 is:\n\n$$\nW_{2} \\rightarrow_{3}=-G M m\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{2}}-\\frac{1}{r_{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nand the work done in the last step is:\n\n$$\nW_{N-1} \\rightarrow_{N}=-G M m \\frac{1}{\\left(N-1-\\frac{1}{r_{N}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nMore coal has been used since 1945 than was used in the whole of history before that.\n\nHence, the total work done in displacing a body from point 1 to N is calculated by adding up the work done during all these steps.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nW_{\\text {tutel }} & =W_{1} \\rightarrow_{2}+W_{2} \\rightarrow_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots . .+W_{N-1} \\rightarrow_{N} \\\\\n& =-G M m\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\\frac{1}{r_{2}}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{2}}-\\frac{1}{r_{3}}\\right)+\\ldots \\ldots+\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{N-1}} \\frac{1}{r_{N}}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOn simplification, we have\n\n$$\nW_{\\text {totel }}=-G M m\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\\frac{1}{r_{N}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIf the point N is situated at an infinite distance from the Earth, then\n\nHence\n\n$$\nr_{N}=\\infty \\quad ; \\quad \\text { so } \\quad \\frac{1}{r_{N}}=\\frac{1}{\\infty}=0\n$$\n\nThis total work by definition is the absolute potential energy (P.E) as stated earlier represented by $U$.\n\n$$\nU=-\\frac{G M m}{r}\n$$\n\nThis is also known as the absolute value of gravitational potential energy of a body at a distance $r$ from the centre of the Earth.\nNote that when $r$ increases, $U$ becomes less negative i.e., $U$ increases. It means when we raise a body above the surface of the Earth, its P.E. increases. Therefore, if we want to raise the body up to infinite distance, we will have to do work on it equal to $\\frac{G M m}{R}$, so thatits P.E. becomes zero.\nNow the absolute potential energy on the surface of the Earth is found by putting $r=R$ (Radius of the Earth), so\n\n$$\n\\text { Absolute potential energy }=U_{0}=-\\frac{G M m}{R}\n$$\n\nThe negative sign shows that the Earth's gravitational field for mass $m$ is attractive. The above expression gives the work or the energy required to take the body out of the\n\nEarth's gravitational field, where its potential energy with respect to Earth is zero.\n\n# 4.6 ESCAPE VELOCITY\n\nIt is our daily life experience that an object projected upward comes back to the ground after rising to a certain height. This is due to the force of gravity acting downward. With increased initial velocity, the object rises to the greater height before coming back. If we go on increasing the initial velocity of the object, a stage comes when it will not return to the ground. It will escape from the influence of gravity.\n\nThe initial velocity of an object with which it goes out of the Earth's gravitational field, is known as escape velocity.\n\n## Some Escape speeds (km s)\n\n| Heavendy body Escape speed |  |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| Moon | 2.4 |\n| Mercury | 4.3 |\n| Mars | 5.0 |\n| Venus | 10.4 |\n| Earth | 11.2 |\n| Uranus | 22.4 |\n| Neptune | 25.4 |\n| Saturn | 37.0 |\n| Jupiter | 61 |\n\nThe escape velocity corresponds to the initial kinetic energy gained by the body, which carries it to an infinite distance from the surface of the Earth.\n\n$$\n\\text { Initial } K . E .=\\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\text {sec }}^{2}\n$$\n\nWe know that the work done in lifting a body from Earth's surface to an infinite distance is equal to the increase in potential energy\n\n$$\n\\text { Incerase in } P . E .=0-\\left(-G \\frac{M m}{R}\\right)=G \\frac{M m}{R}\n$$\n\nwhere $M$ and $R$ are the mass and radius of the Earth respectively. The body will escape out of the gravitational field if the initial $K . E$. of the body is equal to increase in $P . E$. Then\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\text {sec }}^{2}=G \\frac{M m}{R}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nv_{\\text {ess }}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{R}}\n$$\n\nAs\n\n$$\ng=\\frac{G M}{R^{2}} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad g R=\\frac{G M}{R}\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\nv_{\\text {ess }}=\\sqrt{2 g R}\n$$\n\nThe value of $v_{\\text {sec }}$ comes out to be approximately $11 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.\n\n### 4.7 WORK-ENERGY THEOREM\n\nWhenever work is done on a body, it increases its energy. For example, if a force $F$ acts on a body of mass $m$, initially moving with velocity $v_{r}$, through a distance $d$ and increases its velocity to $v_{r}$, then the acceleration produced will be:\n\n$$\n2 a d=v_{r}^{2}-v_{r}^{2}\n$$\n\n# Physics II\n\nor\n\n$$\na=\\frac{1}{2 d}\\left(v_{f}^{2}-v_{f}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nFrom the second law of motion:\n\n$$\nF=m a\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\na=\\frac{F}{m}\n$$\n\nComparing Eqs. 4.16 and 4.17, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{F}{m}=\\frac{1}{2 d}\\left(v_{f}^{2}-v_{f}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nF d=\\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}\n$$\n\n## 1444\n\n## 1444\n\nAll the food you eat in one day has about the same energy as $1 / 3$ litre of petrol\nor\n\n$$\nF d=\\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}\n$$\n\nThis expression is the work-energy theorem. It states that:\nThe change in kinetic energy of an object is equal to the work done on it by a net force.\n$W=$ Change in kinetic energy $=(K . E)_{t}-(K . E)_{t}=\\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}$\nThis is also known as work-energy principle.\nThe work-energy theorem is applicable for any direction of the force relative to the displacement. For instance, an object with kinetic energy can perform work if it is allowed to push or pull on another object. In this case, the work will be taken as negative and the kinetic energy of the object will decrease. The theorem remains valid even if the force may vary from point to point.\n\nExample 4.4 A motorcycle rider weighing 80 kg is coasting down a $24^{\\circ}$ slope. The weight of motorcycle is 30 kg . At the top of the slope, the speed of motorcycle is $3.2 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. If the kinetic frictional force is 100 N , what will be the speed of the motorcycle 72 m downhill?\nSolution The normal force $F_{n}$ is balanced by the component of weight (mgcos $24^{\\circ}$ ) perpendicular to the slope, Let the kinetic frictional force is $f$, then the net force Fis:\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F=m g \\sin 24^{\\circ}-f \\quad \\text { where } m=\\text { total mass }=60 \\mathrm{~kg}+30 \\mathrm{~kg}=90 \\mathrm{~kg} \\\\\n& F=\\left(90 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 9.8 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \\times 0.4\\right)-100 \\mathrm{~N} \\\\\n& F=252.8 \\mathrm{~N}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWok done $W=F d=252.8 \\mathrm{~N} \\times 72 \\mathrm{~m}=18201.8 \\mathrm{~J}$\nAs work is positive, so applying work-energy theorem,\n\n$$\nW=(K .

At position A, the body has $P . E .=m g h$ and $K . E .=0$. We release the body and as it falls, we can examine how kinetic and potential energies associated with it interchange.\nLet us calculate P.E. and K.E. at the position B when the body has fallen a distance $x$, ignoring air friction.\nNow, height from the ground is $(h-x)$, so that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P .

E .=\\frac{1}{2} m v_{c}^{2}$, where $v_{c}$ can be found out by the following expression.\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v_{c}^{2}=v_{i}^{2}+2 g h=2 g h \\text { as } v_{i}=0 \\\\\n& K . E=\\frac{1}{2} m v_{c}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2} m \\times 2 g h=m g h\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, at point $C$, kinetic energy is equal to the original value of the potential energy of the body. Actually, when a body falls, its velocity increases i.e., the body is being accelerated under the action of gravity. The increase in velocity results in the increase in its kinetic energy. On the other hand, as the body falls, its height decreases and hence, its potential energy also decreases. Thus, we see (Fig. 4.13) that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { Loss in P.E. = Gain in K.E } \\\\\nm g\\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2} m\\left(v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are he velocities of the body at the heights $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ respectively. This result is true only when frictional force is not considered.\nIf we assume that a frictional force $f$ is present during the downward motion, then a part of P.E. is used in doing work against friction equal to $f h$. The remaining $P . E .=m g h-f h$ is converted into K.E.\n\nHence\n\n$$\nm g h-f h=\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nm g h=\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+f h\n$$\n\nThus\nLoss in P.E. = Gain in K.E. + Work done against friction\nConversely,\nLoss of K.E. = Gain in P.E. + Work done against friction\n\n# Example 4.5\n\nA car weighing 1100 kg is moving with a velocity of $12 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. When it is at point $P$, its engine stops. If the frictional force is 120 N , what will be its velocity at point $Q$ ? How far beyond $Q$ will it go before coming to rest?\n\n## Solution\n\nThe kinetic energy possessed by the car at point $P$ will partly be converted into P.E. and partly used up in doing work against friction as it reaches point $Q$.

          "title": "Solids and Fluid Dynamics\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nAfter studying this chapter, the students will be able to:\n\n- Distinguish between the structures of crystalline, amorphous, and polymeric solids.\n- Describe that deformation of solids in one dimension [That it is caused by a force and that in one dimension, the deformation can be tensile or compressive.]\n- Define and use the terms stress, strain and the Young's modulus\n- Describe an experiment to determine the Young's modulus of a metal wire.\n- Describe and use the terms elastic deformation, plastic deformation and elastic limit\n- Justify why and apply the fact that the area under the force-extension graph represents the work done\n- Determine the elastic potential energy of a material [That is, deformed within its limit of proportionality from the area under the force-extension graph. Also state and use $E_{0}=\\frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$ for a material deformed within its limit of proportionality]\n- State and use Archimedes' principle and flotation\n- Justify how ships are engineered to float in the sea.\n- Define and apply the terms: steady (streamline or laminar) flow, incompressible flow and non viscous flow as applied to the motion of an ideal fluid.\n- State and use equation of continuity to solve problems\n- Explain that squeezing the end of a rubber pipe results in increase in flow velocity\n- Justify that the equation of continuity is a form of the principle of conservation of mass.\n- Justify that the pressure difference can arise from different rates of flow of a fluid [Bemoulli effect]\n- Explain and apply Bemoulli's equation for horizontal and vertical fluid flow.\n- Explain why real fluids are viscous fluids.\n- Describe how viscous forces in a fluid cause a retarding force on an object moving through it.\n- Describe super fluidity [As the state in which a liquid will experience zero viscosity. Students should know the implications of this state e.g. this allows for super fluids to creep over the walls of containers to 'empty' themselves. It also implies that if you stir a superfluid, the vortices will keep spinning indefinitely.]\n- Analyze the real-world applications of the Bemoulli effect [For example, atomizers in perfume bottles, the swinging trajectory of a spinning cricket ball and the lift of a spinning golf ball (the Magnus effect), the use of Venture ducts in filter pumps and car engineers to adjust the flow of fluid, etc.]\n\nMaterials have specific uses depending upon their characteristics and properties, such as hardness, ductility, malleability, etc. What makes a metal hard and other soft? It depends upon the structure, the particular order and bonding of atoms and molecules in a material. Similarly, the study of fluids in motion is relatively complicated but analysis can be simplified by making a few assumptions. The analysis is further simplified by the use of two important conservation principles, the conservation of mass and conservation of energy. The law of conservation of mass gives us the equation of continuity while the law of conservation of energy is the basis of Bemoulli's equation.\n\n# 5.1 CLASSIFICATION OF SOLIDS\n\n## Crystalline Solids\n\nIn crystalline solids, there is a regular arrangement of atoms and molecules. The neighbours of every molecule are arranged in a regular pattern that is consistent throughout the crystal. There is, thus, an ordered structure in crystalline solids. Most solids, like metals and ceramics have a crystalline structure. This means their atoms, molecules or ions are arranged in a regular pattern. The arrangement of molecules, atoms or ions within all types of crystalline solids can be studied using various techniques such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). It should be noted that atoms, molecules or ions in a crystalline solid are not static. For example, each atom in a crystal vibrates about a fixed point with an amplitude that increases with rise in temperature. It is the average atomic positions which are perfectly ordered over large distances.\nThe cohesive forces between atoms, molecules or ions in crystalline solids maintain the strict long-range order inspite of atomic vibrations. For every crystal, however, there is a temperature at which the vibrations become greater that the structure suddenly breaks up, and the solid melts. The transition from solid (order) to liquid (disorder) is, therefore, abrupt or discontinuous. Every crystalline solid has a definite melting point e.g., Quartz, Calcite, Sugar, Mica, diamond, etc.\n\n## Amorphous or Glassy Solids\n\nThe word amorphous means without form or structure. Thus, in amorphous solids there is no regular arrangement of molecules like that in crystalline solids. We can, therefore, say that amorphous solids are more like liquids with the disordered structure frozen in.\nFor example, ordinary glass, which is a solid at ordinary temperature, has no regular arrangement of molecules. On heating, it gradually softens into a paste like state before it becomes a very viscous liquid at almost $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Thus, amorphous solids are also called glassy solids. This type of solids has no definite melting point e.g., plastic, glass, fused silicon, etc.\nCrystalline solids\nAmorphous solids\n\n## Polymeric Solids\n\nPolymers are solid materials with a structure that is intermediate between order and disorder. They can be classified as partially or poorly crystalline solids.\n\nPolymers form a large group of naturally occurring and synthetic materials. Plastics and synthetic rubbers are termed as polymers because they are formed by polymerization reactions in which relatively simple molecules are chemically combined into massive long chain molecules, or three-dimensional structures. These materials have rather low specific gravity compared with even the lightest of metals, and yet exhibit good strength to weight ratio.\nPolymers consist wholly or in part of chemical combinations of carbon with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and other metallic or non metallic elements. Polythene, polystyrene and nylon, etc. are examples of polymers. Natural rubber is composed in the pure state entirely of a hydrocarbon with the formula $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{2} \\mathrm{H}_{5}\\right)_{n}$.\n\n# 5.2 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS\n\n## Deformation in Solids\n\nIf we hold a soft rubber ball in our hand and then squeeze it, the shape or volume of the ball will change. However, if we stop squeezing the ball, and open our hand, the ball will return to its original spherical shape. This has been illustrated schematically in Fig. 5.1.\nSimilarly, if we hold two ends of a rubber string in our hands, and move our hands apart to some extent, the length of the\nstring will increase under the action of the applied force (a) Originalrubber ball exerted by our hands. Greater the applied force, larger will be (b) Squeezed rubber ball the increase in length. Now on removing the applied force, the (c) Rubber ball after removing string will return to its original length. From these examples, it is concluded that deformation (i.e., change in shape, length or volume) is produced when a body is subjected to some external force.\nIn crystalline solids, atoms are usually arranged in a certain order. These atoms are held about their equilibrium position, which depends on the strength of the inter-atomic cohesive force between them. Under the influence of external force, distortion occurs in the solid bodies because of the displacement of the atoms from their equilibrium position and the body is said to be in a state of stress. After the removal of external force, the atoms return to their equilibrium position, and the body regains its original shape, provided that external applied force was not too great. The ability of the body to return to its original shape is called elasticity. Figure 6.2. illustrates deformation produced in a unit cell of a crystal subjected to an external applied force.\nFig. 5.2\n\n# 5.3 STRESS, STRAIN AND YOUNG'S MODULUS\n\nThe results of mechanical tests are usually expressed in terms of stress and strain, which are defined in terms of applied force and deformation.\n\n## Stress\n\nIt is defined as the force applied per unit area to produce any change in the shape, volume or length of a body. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\text { Stress }(\\sigma)=\\frac{\\text { Force }(F)}{\\text { Area }(A)}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of stress ( $\\sigma$ ) is newton per square metre ( $\\mathrm{N} \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ ), which is given the name pascal (Pa). Stress may cause a change in length, volume and shape. When a stress changes length, it is called the tensile stress, when it changes the volume, it is called the volume stress and when it changes the shape, it is called the shear stress.\n\n## Strain\n\nStrain is a measure of the deformation of a solid when stress is applied to it. In the case of deformation in one dimension, strain is defined as the fractional change in length. If $\\Delta L$ is the change in length and $L$ is the original length (Fig. 5.3-a), then strain is given by\n\n$$\n\\text { Strain }(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{\\text { Change in length }(\\Delta L)}{\\text { Original length }(L)}\n$$\n\nSince strain is the ratio of lengths, it is dimensionless and therefore, has no units. If strain $\\varepsilon$ is due to tensile stress $\\sigma$ it is called tensile strain, and if it is produced as a result of compressive stress $\\sigma$, it is termed as compressive strain.\nIn case when the applied stress changes the volume, the change in volume per unit volume is known as volumetric strain as shown in Fig. 5.3 (b), thus\n\nVolumetric strain $\\left(\\varepsilon_{v}\\right)=\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_{0}}$\nFig. 5.3(b): Volumetric strain\nFig. 5.3(c): Shear strain\n\nLet $y$ be the distance between two opposite faces of a rigid body (Fig. 5.3-c), which are subjected to shear stress one of its face slides through a distance $\\Delta x$, then shear strain is produced which is is given by\n\n$$\n\\text { Shear strain }(\\gamma)=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\gamma}=\\tan \\theta\n$$\n\nHowever, for small value of angle $\\theta$, measured in radian $\\tan \\theta \\cong \\theta$, so that\n\n$$\n\\gamma=0\n$$\n\n## Young's Modulus\n\nThe stress applied per unit strain is called Young's modulus\ni.e. $Y=\\frac{\\text { Tensile stress }}{\\text { Tensile strain }}$\n\n$$\nY=\\frac{F / A}{\\Delta L / L_{0}}\n$$\n\nIt has the same unit as that of stress i.e., $\\mathrm{N} \\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The value of Young's modulus of different material is given in Table 5.1.\nThere are various methods to determine the Young's modulus of a wire. One of the method is Searle's method.",

This theory provides a macroscopic understanding of gas properties such as pressure, temperature, and volume. Thetnodynamics thus plays a key role in technology, since almost all the raw energy available for our use is liberated in the form of heat. In this chapter, we shall study the bebaviour of gases and laws of thermodynamics, their significance and applications.\n\n### 6.1 ASSUMPTIONS OF THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES\n\nThe kinetic theory of gases is a fundamental theory in physics and chemistry that explains the behaviour of gases based on the motion of their constituent particles. This theory provides a macroscopic understanding of gas properties such as pressure, temperature, and volume. Here are the key assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases.\n\n## 1. Gas Particles are in Constant, Random Motion\n\nGas molecules are in perpetual, random motion. They move in straight lines until they collide with either another molecule or the walls of the container.\n\n## 2. Negligible Volume of Gas Particles\n\nThe volume of the individual gas molecules is negligible as compared to the total volume of the gas. This means that the particles are considered point masses with no significant volume.\n\n## 3. No Intermolecular Forces\n\nThere are no attractive or repulsive forces between the gas molecules. The particles do not exert any force on each other except during collisions.\n\n## 4. Elastic Collisions\n\nThe collisions between gas molecules, and with the walls of the container are perfectly elastic. This means that there is no net loss of kinetic energy during collisions. The total kinetic energy is conserved.\n\n## 5. Large Number of Particles\n\nA gas contains a large number of particles. This large number allows for the use of statistical methods to describe the properties of the gas.\n\n## 6. Average Kinetic Energy is Proportional to Temperature\n\nThe average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. This implies that as the temperature increases, the speed of the gas particles also increases.\n\n## 7. Pressure due to Particle Collisions\n\nThe pressure exerted by a gas on the walls of its container is due to the collisions of gas\n\nparticles with the walls. The force exerted by the particles during collisions generates pressure.\n\n# 8. Time of Collisions is Negligible\n\nThe time interval of a collision between gas particles is extremely short compared to the time between collisions. This assumption simplifies the analysis of particle dynamics.\n\n## Limitations of Kinetic Molecular Theory\n\n## Real Gases\n\nThe assumptions of the kinetic theory hold true for ideal gases, but real gases exhibit deviations due to intermolecular forces and finite molecular volume, especially at high pressures and low temperatures.\nIn summary, the kinetic theory of gases provides a macroscopic view of gas behaviour, linking macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature to the motion of gas particles, and serves as a foundational concept in understanding thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.\n\n## Equation of State for an Ideal Gas\n\nA gas that obeys kinetic theory of gases is termed as an ideal gas. Ideal gas equation is given by\n\n$$\nP V=n R T \\quad \\ldots(6.1)\n$$\n\nHere $P$ represents pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is number of moles of the gas, $R$ is universal gas constant ( $R=8.3145 \\mathrm{~J} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\mathrm{~K}$ ) and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\nEquation (6.1) implies that product of pressure and volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature for an ideal gas.\n\n## Real Gas to Behays Like an Ideal Gas\n\nAccording to kinetic theory of gases, a gas has no intermolecular interaction and molecules are far apart from each other. For a real gas to behave like an ideal gas, some conditions must be satisfied. P.E. of the gas molecules is negligible and this have only K.E.\n\nNumber of moles ' $n$ 'can be given by\n\n$$\nn=\\frac{\\text { Mass of gas }}{\\text { Molar mass of gas }}=\\frac{m}{M}\n$$\n\nSo, Eq. (6.1) becomes: $P V=\\frac{m}{M} R T \\quad$ or $\\quad P M=\\left(\\frac{m}{V}\\right) R T$\nWe know that density; $\\rho=\\frac{m}{V}, \\quad$ So, $\\quad \\rho=\\frac{P M}{R T}$ as $\\frac{M}{R}$ is constant $\\therefore \\rho \\propto \\frac{P}{T}$\nThe density of a gas will be low at low pressure and high temperature due to which molecules of the gas will be at large distance from each other and the intermolecular\n\nforces will be negligible. So, the real gas behaves like an ideal gas at low pressure and high temperature.\n\n# Ideal Gas Equation in Terms of Boltzmann Constant\n\nFrom ideal gas equation:\n\n$$\nP V=n R T\n$$\n\nA mole can be defined as the number of atoms or molecules per unit Avogadro's number ( $N_{A}=6.02 \\times 10^{20}$ ).\n\n## Mathematically;\n\n$$\nn=\\frac{N}{N_{A}}\n$$\n\n(ii) , N is number of atoms or molecules\n\nSubstituting Eq. (ii) in Eq. (i), we have\n\n$$\nP V=\\frac{N}{N_{A}} R T\n$$\n\nThe term $\\frac{R}{N_{A}}$ is termed as Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\nk_{B}=\\frac{R}{N_{A}}\n$$\n\n(6.2)\n\nFor your information\nReal gases approach ideal beheviour under:\n(i) low pressure\n(ii) high temperature\n\nSubstituting the values of $R$ and $N_{A}$ we have\n\n$$\nk_{B}=1.38 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{~K}^{-1}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Eq. (6.2) in Eq. (iii),\n\n$$\nP V=N k_{B} T\n$$\n\nEquation (6.3) gives ideal gas equation in terms of Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$.\n(1) Example 6.1 One mole of an ideal gas is at a temperature of 300 K . If the Boltzmann constant is $1.38 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~J} \\mathrm{~K}^{-1}$, calculate the volume of the gas at a pressure of 1 atom. [1atm $=101325 \\mathrm{~Pa}]$\nSolution We know that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P V=n R T \\\\\n& R=N_{A} \\times k_{B} \\quad \\text { where } k_{B}=\\frac{R}{N_{A}} \\\\\n& \\text { Here } \\quad V=\\frac{n N_{A} k_{B} T}{P} \\\\\n& \\begin{array}{l}\nV=\\frac{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\times 6.02 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\times 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} \\mathrm{~K}^{-1} \\times 300 \\mathrm{~K}}{101325 \\mathrm{~Pa}} \\\\\nV \\approx 0.0245 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}\n\\end{array}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, volume of gas would be $0.0245 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$.\n\n# Gas Laws\n\nThere are some variables (state functions) which describe quantity of gas which includes pressure, volume, and temperature ( $P, V$, and $T$ ) with change in one variable, the second variable changes while the third is kept constant. The laws that relate these variables mutually for an ideal gas are termed as gas laws.\n\n## Boyle's Law\n\nThis law was introduced by Robert Boyle in 1662, and it provides a relationship between pressure and volume of a gas at constant temperature. It sates that for a fixed mass of an ideal gas, the pressure $P$ exerted by a gas varies inversely with volume $V$ occupied by the gas at constant temperature.\nMathematically;\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P \\propto \\frac{1}{V} \\text { at constant } T \\\\\n& P=\\text { constant } \\frac{1}{V} \\text { or } P V=\\text { constant }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor $\\quad P_{1} V_{1}=P_{2} V_{2}$\nGraphical representation of Boyle's law is shown in Fig. 6.1.\n\n## Charles' Law\n\nCharles' law relates volume and temperature of an ideal gas for a fixed mass at constant pressure. This law was formulated in 1870 by a French Physicist Jacques Charles. It states that the volume of given mass of gas at constant pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.\nMathematically;\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& V \\propto T \\text { atconstant } P \\\\\n& V \\\\\n& T=\\text { constant } \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\\\\n& \\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nGraphically, it can be shown in Fig. 6.2.\n\n## Joseph lussac's Law\n\nFig. 6.2\n\nIt states that for a fixed mass of an ideal gas, the pressure exerted by a gas varies directly with absolute temperature of the gas at constant volume.\nMathematically;\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P \\propto T \\text { at constant } V \\\\\n& P=\\text { constant } \\times T\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n| Physica II |  | (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) Heat and Thermodynamics |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| or | $\\frac{P}{T}=$ constant |  |  |  |  |\n| or | $\\frac{P}{T_{1}}=\\frac{P_{1}}{T_{1}}$ |  |  |  | $V=$ constant |\n| Graphically, Joseph lussac's law is shown in Fig. 6.3. |  |  |  |  | Fig. 6.3 |\n\n# Thermal Equilibrium\n\nWhen two bodies are at the same temperature, the thermal energy (which is related to the kinetic energy of particles) of each body is equal. As a result, there is no driving force for heat transfer between them, and thus they remain in thermal equilibrium.\n\n## Example\n\nWhen we put a metal spoon into a hot cup of coffee:\n(i) initially, the coffee is hotter than the spoon.\n(ii) over time, heat flows from the coffee to the spoon.\n(iii) eventually, the coffee and spoon reach at the same temperature.\n\nThermal equilibrium is achieved at this point, there is no net heat flow between the coffee and the spoon, and they are said to be in thermal equilibrium.\n\n### 6.2 INTERNALENERGY\n\nThe sum of all forms of molecular energies (kinetic and potential) of a substance is termed as its internal energy. In the study of thermodynamics, usually ideal gas is considered as a working substance. The molecules of an ideal gas are mere mass points which exert no forces on one another. So, the internal energy of an ideal gas system is generally the translational $K . E$. of its molecules. Since the temperature of a system is defined as the average $K . E$ of its molecules, thus for an ideal gas system, the internal energy is directly proportional to its temperature.\nAccording to the kinetic theory of gases, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is given by\n$\\langle K . E\\rangle=\\frac{3}{2} k_{a} T$ or $\\left\\langle\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\frac{3}{2} k_{a} T$\nwhere $k_{a}$ is Boltzmann constant.\nTherefore, the rise in temperature of an object reflects an increase in the internal kinetic energy of its particles. This increase in internal energy can\nDifferent processes can lead to changes in internal energy and temperature, such as heating (adding heat), adiabatic compression or expansion (no heat exchange), or phase changes (where heat energy changes the state of matter without changing temperature).\n\noccur due to the absorption of heat energy, which raises the average kinetic energy of the particles and thus increases the temperature of the object.\n\n### 6.3 HEAT AND WORK\n\nWe know that both heat and work correspond to transfer of energy by some means. The idea was first applied to the steam engine where it was natural to transfer heat in and get work out. Consequently, it made a sense to define both heat in and work out as positive quantities. Hence, work done by the system on its environment is considered positive while work done on the system by the environment is taken as negative. If an amount of heat $Q$ enters the system, it could manifest itself as either an increase in internal energy or as a resulting quantity of work performed by the system on the surrounding or both.\nWe can express the work in terms of directly measurable variables. Consider the gas enclosed in the cylinder with a moveable, frictionless piston of cross-sectional area $A$ as shown in Fig.6.4(a). In equilibrium, the system occupies volume $V$ and exerts a pressure $P$ on the walls of the cylinder and its piston. The force $F$ exerted by the gas on the piston is $P A$.\nWe assume that the gas expands through $\\Delta V$ very slowly, so that it remains in equilibrium as shown in Fig. 6.4(b). As the piston moves up through a small distance $\\Delta y$, the work $W$ done by the gas is:\nThe work done can also be calculated by area of the curve under $P-V$ graph as shown in Fig. 6.5.",

When a musician plucks a guitar string, sound waves are generated in air which reach our ears and produces sensation of music. The vast energy of the Sun, millions of kilometres away, is transferred to the Earth by light waves. In this chapter, we will discuss, formation, propagation and applications of different types of waves.\n\n### 7.1 WAVES\n\nA wave is a regular disturbance or variation that carries energy, which spreads out from the source. For example, energy is transferred from the Sun to the Earth in the form of light waves called electromagnetic waves. These waves can even travel through\n\nvacuum. However, in a medium, energy is transferred due to the regular and repeated disturbances that travel through the medium, making its particles to move up and down or back and forth (to and fro). Imagine a stone thrown into a pond of water (Fig. 7.1).\n\n- The stone produces a disturbance (ripple) that travels through the water (medium).\nFig. 7.1: Reprosenting a travelling disturbance (ripple)\n\n- The water particles move up and down about their mean positions, creating a repeating pattern known as wave that spreads out.\nThe displacement of a particle of a wave is its distance in a specified direction from its rest / equilibrium position. If the displacement is plotted along the $y$-axis and the time in the direction of energy travel along the $x$-axis, we get a waveform as shown in Fig. 7.2.\nThe waves can be described by the following parameters:\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The maximum displacement of the wave (or particles of the medium) from its equilibrium position.\n2. Frequency ( $f$ ): The number of oscillations or vibrations or cycles per second.\n3. Wavelength ( $\\lambda$ ) The distance between two consecutive similar points on the wave that are in phase.\nFig. 7.2: Graphical description of a wave\n\n# 4. Period (T): The time taken by the wave to complete one oscillation or cycle. it is the reciprocal of the frequency $T=1 / f$.\n5. Speed ( $v$ ): The speed at which the wave travels. If a wave crest moves one wavelength $\\lambda$ in one period of oscillation $T$, the speed $v$ is given by $v=\\lambda / T$ as $1 / T=f$, so $\\quad v=f \\lambda$\n6. Phase ( $\\theta$ ): The relative position of a point on the wave at a given time.\n\n## Types of Waves\n\nWaves have various forms, each with unique characteristics. A brief detail of different types of waves is given below:\n\n# 1. Mechanical Waves\n\nThese waves require a physical medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to propagate. Examples are water waves (ocean, lake, or pond ripples), sound waves (audible vibrations in air, water, or solids), seismic waves (earthquakes), etc.\n\n## 2. Electromagnetic Waves\n\nThey do not require a medium to propagate and therefore, can travel through vacuum. Examples are radiowaves (wireless communication), Microwaves (cooking and heating), infrared waves (IR or heat radiation), Visible light (sunlight, lamp light), Ultraviolet waves (UV radiation), X-rays (medical imaging), Gamma rays (high-energy radiation), etc.\n\n## 3. Quantum Waves\n\nQuantum waves are associated with particles like electrons and photons. Examples are matter waves/particle waves (electron waves in atoms) or de-Broglie waves, photon waves (light quanta), etc.\n\n## 4. Surface Waves\n\nSurface waves propagate along surfaces or interfaces between two mediums. Examples are ocean surface waves (wind-driven waves), seismic surface waves, etc.\n\n## Transverse and Longitudinal Waves\n\nThere are two main types of waves which are named as transverse waves and longitudinal waves. A transverse wave is one in which the vibrations of the particles are at right angles to the direction in which the energy of the wave is travelling whereas a longitudinal wave is one in which the direction of the vibration of the particles is along or parallel to the the direction in which the energy of the wave is travelling.\nThe transverse wave and longitudinal wave are illustrated in Figs. 7.3 (a and b), respectively.\n\n## Transverse waves\n\nLongitudinal waves\nFig. 7.3: Main types of waves\n\n### 7.2 PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION OF WAVES\n\nIf a particle of the medium is simultaneously acted upon by two waves, then the resultant displacement of the particle is the algebraic sum of their individual displacements. This is called principle of superposition.\nIn other words, the displacements of the individual waves are added together to form a new wave pattern as shown in Fig. 7.4 (a and b), respectively.\n(i) If two waves, which overlap each other, have same phase, their resultant displacement will be:\n\nwhere\n\n$$\ny_{1}=\\text { amplitude of wave } 1\n$$\n\n$y_{2}=$ amplitude of wave 2\nand\n$y=$ resultant amplitude\nParticularly, if $y_{1}=y_{2}$, then resultant displacement will be:\n\n$$\ny=2 y_{11} \\text { or } y=2 y_{2}\n$$\n\n(ii) If two waves, which cross each other, have opposite phase, their resultant displacement will be:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y=y_{1}+\\left(-y_{2}\\right) \\\\\n& y=y_{1}-y_{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n7.4 (a): Superposition of two waves of the same frequency which are exactly in phase.\n\nParticularly, if $y_{1}=y_{2}$, then resultant displacement will be $y=0$. Thus, if a particle of a medium is simultaneously acted upon by $n$ waves such that its displacement due to each of the individual $n$ waves be $y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots \\ldots, y_{n}$, then the resultant displacement $y$ of the particle, under the simultaneous action of these $n$ waves is the algebraic sum of all the displacements, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny=y_{1}+y_{2}+\\ldots \\ldots \\ldots+y_{n}\n$$\n\nThis is called principle of superposition of waves. Methematically, this can also be represented as:\n\n$$\ny(x, t)=y_{1}(x, t)+y_{2}(x, t)+\\ldots \\ldots+y_{n}(x, t)\n$$\n\nwhere $y(x, t)$ is the resultant wave, whereas $y_{1}(x, t)$, $y_{2}(x, t), \\ldots \\ldots, y_{n}(x, t)$ are the individual waves.\nIn the context of waves, $y(x, t)$ represents the wave function or wave displacement at a given point $x$ and time $t$. It describes the shape of the wave and its evolution over time. The principle of superposition applies to linear waves or small amplitude waves.\nPrinciple of superposition of waves leads to many interesting phenomena:\n(i) Two waves having same frequency and travelling in the same direction (Interference).\n(ii) Two waves of slightly different frequencies and travelling in the same direction (Beats).\n(iii) Two waves of equal frequency travelling in opposite direction (Stationary waves).\nAn interference pattern formed with white light.\n\n# Applications of the Principle of Superposition\n\nBy applying the principle of superposition of waves, noise-cancelling headphones effectively eliminate unwanted noise, providing a more immersive and peaceful listening experience.\n\n1. The headphones contain one or more microphones that capture ambient noise (like background chatter or engine rumble or any environmental noise).\n2. The microphone sends the sound signals to an amplifier and a processing unit in the headphones.\n3. The processing unit generates an \"anti-noise\" signal, which is the exact opposite of the ambient noise (in terms of amplitude and phase).\n4. The anti-noise signal is then played through the headphones, along with the desired audio (like music or voice).\n5. When the anti-noise signal meets the ambient noise, the two waves cancel each other out resulting in a much quieter listening experience.\nThough the above example is an oversimplification of the situation, as noise-cancelling headphones use complex algorithms and multiple microphones to achieve optimal noise cancellation, the basic principle of superposition remains a fundamental concept in understanding how they work.\n\n### 7.3 INTERFERENCE AND ITS TYPES\n\nSuperposition of two waves having the same frequency and travelling in the same direction results in phenomenon called interference.\nFig. 7.5(a): An experimental setup to observe interference of sound waves.\n\nFig. 7.5 (b): Interference of sound waves\nAn experimental setup to observe interference effect of sound waves is shown in Fig. 7.5(a). Two loud speakers $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ act as two sources of harmonic sound waves of a fixed frequency produced by an Audio Generator (AG). Since the two speakers are driven from the same generator, therefore, they vibrate in phase. Such sources of waves are called coherent sources. A microphone attached to a sensitive Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) acts as a detector of sound waves. The CRO is a device to display\n\nthe input signal into waveform on its screen. The microphone is placed at various points, turn by turn, in front of the loud speakers as shown in Fig.7.5(b).\n\n# Constructive Interference\n\nAt points $P_{1}, P_{3}$ and $P_{2}$, we find that a compression meets a compression and a rarefaction meets a rarefaction. So, the displacement of two waves are added up at these points according to the principle of superposition and a large resultant displacement is seen on the CRO screen (Fig.7.5-c).\nFig. 7.5(c):\nConstructive Interference: Large displacement is displayed on the CRO screen\nFig. 7.5(d):\nDestructive Interference:\nZero displacement is displayed on the CRO screen\nInterference pattern produced by a thin soap film Illuminated by white light.\n\nFrom Fig. 7.5 (b), we find that the path difference $\\Delta S$ between the waves at the point $P_{1}$, is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta S=S_{2} P_{1}-S_{1} P_{1} \\\\\n& \\Delta S=4 \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda-3 \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda=\\lambda\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, at points $P_{3}$ and $P_{2}$, path difference is zero and $\\lambda$, respectively. Here, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength which is the distance between any two successive solid or dashed lines.\n\nWhenever the path difference is an integral multiple of wavelength, the two waves are added up. This effect is called constructive interference.\nTherefore, the path difference (condition) for constructive interference can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S=n \\lambda \\quad \\text { where } n=0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\ldots \\ldots\n$$\n\n## Destructive Interference\n\nAt points $P_{2}$ and $P_{4}$, a compression meets a rarefaction, so that they cancel each other's effect according to the principle of superposition. The resultant displacement becomes zero, as shown in Fig. 7.5(d).\nThe path difference $\\Delta S$ between the waves at points $P_{3}$ and $P_{4}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta S=S_{2} P_{2}-S_{1} P_{2} \\\\\n& \\Delta S=4 \\lambda-3 \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda=\\frac{1}{2} \\lambda\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, at $P$, the path difference is $\\frac{1}{2} \\lambda$.\nSo, at points where the displacements of two waves cancel each other's effect, the path difference is an odd integral multiple of half the wavelength. This effect is called destructive interference.\nTherefore, the path difference (condition) for destructive interference can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S=(2 n+1) \\lambda / 2 \\quad \\text { where } n=0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3\n$$\n\nExample 7.1 Two speakers are arranged as shown in the figure. The distance between them is 3.0 m and they emit a constant tone of 344 Hz . A microphone $P$ is moved along a line parallel to and 4.0 m from the line connecting the two speakers. It is found that tone of maximum loudness is heard and displayed on the CRO when microphone is on the centre of the line and directly opposite to each speaker.

They are formed by the superposition of two waves with the same frequency and amplitude, travelling in opposite directions. The resulting wave pattern remains stationary, with nodes (points of zero amplitude) and antinodes (points of maximum amplitude) at fixed positions. Examples include waves on a string, and sound waves in a pipe. The term \"standing wave\" describes that the wave pattern remains fixed in space, oscillating between positive and negative values, without moving forward or backward.\nLet us consider the superposition of two waves moving along a string in opposite directions. Figures 7.6 (a) and (b) show the profile of two such waves at instants $t=0, T / 4, T / 2,3 / 4 T$ and $T$, where $T$ is the time period of the wave. We are interested in finding out the displacements of the points $1,2,3,4,5,6$ and 7 at these instants as the waves superpose. It is obvious that the points $1,2, . ., 7$ are distant $\\lambda / 4$ apart, $\\lambda$ being the wavelength of the waves. We can determine the resultant displacement of these points by applying the principle of superposition.\nFigure 7.6 (c) shows the resultant displacement of the points 1,3,5 and 7 at the instants $t=0, T / 4, T / 2,3 T / 4$ and $T$. It can be seen that the resultant displacement of these points is always zero. These points of the medium are known as nodes. Here, the distance between two consecutive nodes is $\\lambda / 2$.\n\nFig. 7.6: Stationary waves\nFigure 7.6 (d) shows the resultant displacement of the points 2,4 and 6 at the instants $t=0,7 / 4,7 / 2,37 / 4$ and $T$. The figure shows that these points are moving with an amplitude which is the sum of the amplitudes of the component waves represented by arrows. These points are known as antinodes. They are situated midway between the nodes and are $1 / 2$ apart. The distance between a node and the next antinode is $1 / 4$. Such a pattern of nodes and antinodes is known as a stationary or standing wave.\nEnergy in a wave transfers because of the motion of the particles of the medium. The nodes always remain at rest, so energy cannot flow past these points. Hence, energy remains \"standing\" in the medium between nodes, although it alternates between potential and kinetic forms at the antinodes. When the antinodes are all at their extreme displacements, the energy stored is wholly potential and when they are simultaneously passing through their equilibrium positions, the energy is wholly kinetic.\n\n# 7.5 STATIONARY WAVES ON A STRETCHED STRING\n\nConsider a string of length $\\ell$ which is kept stretched by clamping its ends so that the tension in the string is $F$.\n\n## (a) String Plucked at its Middle Point\n\nIf the string is plucked at its middle point, two transverse waves will originate from this point. One of them will move towards the left end of the string and the other towards the right end. When these waves reach the two clamped ends, they are reflected back thus giving rise to stationary waves. As the two ends of the string are clamped, no motion will take place there. So, nodes will be formed at the two ends and one mode of vibration of the string will be as shown in Fig.7.7(a) with the two ends as nodes with one antinode in between. Visually, the string seems to vibrate in one loop. As the distance between two\nFig. 7.7(a): First mode of vibration\n\nconsecutive nodes is one half of the wavelength of the waves set up in the string, so in this mode of vibration, the length $\\ell$ of the string is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\ell=\\lambda_{1} / 2 \\\\\n& \\lambda_{1}=2 \\ell\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_{1}$ is the wavelength of the waves set up in this mode. The speed $v$ of the waves in the string depends upon the tension $F$ of the string and $m$, the mass per unit length of the string. It is independent of the point from where string is plucked to generate wave. It is given by\n\n$$\nv=\\frac{F}{m}\n$$\n\nKnowing the speed $v$ and wavelength $\\lambda_{1}$, the frequency $f_{1}$ of the waves is:\n\n$$\nf_{1}=\\frac{v}{\\lambda_{1}}=\\frac{v}{2 \\ell}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the value of $v$,\n\n$$\nf_{1}=\\frac{1}{2 \\ell} \\cdot \\frac{F}{m}\n$$\n\nThus, in the first mode of vibration shown in Fig. 7.7 (a), waves of frequency $f_{1}$ only will be set up in the given string.\n\n# (b) String Plucked at Quarter Length\n\nIf the same string is plucked from one quarter of its length, again stationary waves will be set up with nodes and antinodes as shown in Fig. 7.7 (b). Note that now the string vibrates in two loops. This particular configuration of nodes and antinodes has developed because the string was plucked from the position of an antinode. As the distance between two consecutive nodes is half the wavelength, so the length $\\ell$ of string is equal to the wavelength of the waves set up in this mode. If $\\lambda_{2}$ is the measure of wavelength of these waves, then,\nComparison of Eq. (7.5) with Eq. (7.1) shows that the wavelength in this case is half of that in the first case. Equation (7.2) shows that the speed of the waves depends on tension and mass per unit length of the string, it is independent of the point where the string is plucked. So, speed $v$ remains the same in both cases.\nIf $f_{2}$ is frequency of vibration of string in its second mode, then\n\n$$\nf_{2}=\\frac{v}{\\lambda_{2}}\n$$\n\n| Physica II |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Since | $\\lambda_{2}=$ | $\\ell$ |  |  |\n| Therefore | $f_{2}$ | $=$ | $\\frac{v}{\\ell}$ |  |\n| Multiplying and dividing by 2 , we have |  |  |  |  |\n|  | $f_{2}$ | $=$ | $\\frac{2 v}{2 \\ell}$ | Brain toaser |\n| We know that: | $f_{1}$ | $=$ | $\\frac{v}{2 \\ell}$ | A guitar string is plucked at <br> to centre. What harmonis is <br> produced? |\n| So | $f_{2}$ | $=$ | $2 f_{1}$ |  |\n\nThus, when the string vibrates in two loops, its frequency becomes double than when it vibrates in one loop.\n\n# (c) String Plucked at an Arbitrary Point\n\nLet the string resonates in $n$ number of loops with $(n+1)$ nodes and $n$ antinodes. Thus, we can say that if the string is made to vibrate in $n$ loops, the frequency of stationary waves set up on the string will be:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f_{n}=n\\left(\\frac{v}{2 \\ell}\\right) \\\\\n& f_{n}=n f_{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand the corresponding wavelength is: $\\lambda_{n}=\\frac{2 \\ell}{n}$\nwhere $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$\nIt is clear that as the string vibrates in more than one loop, its frequency $f$ goes on increasing and the wavelength $\\lambda$ gets correspondingly shorter. However, the product of the frequency fand wavelength $\\lambda$ is always equal to $v$, the speed of waves.\n\nThe above discussion clearly establishes that;\n\n1. The stationary waves have a discrete set of frequencies $f_{1}, 2 f_{1}, 3 f_{1}, \\ldots, n f$, which is known as harmonic series. The lowest characteristic frequency of vibration is the fundamental frequency $f$, corresponds to the first harmonic. The frequency $f_{2}=2 f$, corresponds to the second harmonic and so on.\n2. In other words, quantum jumps in frequency exist between the resonance frequencies. This phenomenon is known as the Quantization of frequencies. It means $f_{n}=n f_{1}$ where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$ (Integral multiples). The stationary waves can be set up on the string only with the frequencies of harmonic series determined by the tension, length and mass per unit length of the string. Waves which are not in harmonic series are quickly damped out.\n3. The frequency of a string on a musical instrument can be changed either by varying the tension or by changing the length. For example, the tension in guitar and violin\n\nstrings is varied by tightening the pegs on the neck of the instrument. Once the instrument is tuned, the musicians vary the frequency by moving their fingers along the neck, thereby changing the length of the vibrating portion of the string.\n\n# Harmonics\n\nIn the above example, the set of all the possible standing waves, having frequencies $f_{1}$, $2 f_{1}, 3 f_{1}, \\ldots, n f_{1}$, are called harmonics of the system. The lowest or fundamental frequency of all the harmonics is called the fundamental or first harmonic. Subsequent frequencies are called as second harmonic, third harmonic, etc.\n\nExample 7.3 A stationary wave is established in a string which is 120 cm long and fixed at both ends. The string vibrates in four segments; at a frequency of 120 Hz . Determine its wavelength and the fundamental frequency?\n\nSolution\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\ell=120 \\mathrm{om}=\\frac{120}{100} \\mathrm{~m}=1.2 \\mathrm{~m} \\\\\n& n=4 \\\\\n& f_{4}=120 \\mathrm{~Hz} \\\\\n& f_{1}=? \\\\\n& \\lambda=?\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(i) As the string vibrates in four segments and the distance between two consecutive nodes is $2 / 2$, so the wavelength of the string is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\ell=n \\frac{\\lambda_{n}}{2} \\\\\n& \\lambda_{n}=\\frac{2 \\ell}{n} \\\\\n& \\lambda_{4}=\\frac{2 \\times 1.2 \\mathrm{~m}}{4} \\\\\n& \\lambda_{4}=0.6 \\mathrm{~m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(ii) If string vibrates in $n$ loops, then frequency of stationary waves will be:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f_{n}=n f_{1} \\\\\n& f_{4}=4 f \\\\\n& 120 \\mathrm{~Hz}=4 f_{1} \\\\\n& f_{1}-\\frac{120 \\mathrm{~Hz}}{4} \\\\\n& f=30 \\mathrm{~Hz}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### 7.6 STATIONARY WAVES IN AIR COLUMNS\n\nStationary waves can be set up in other media also, such as air column inside a pipe or tube. A common example of vibrating air column is in the organ pipe.\n\n# Organ pipe\n\nAn organ pipe is a wind instrument in which sound is produced, due to setting up of stationary waves in air column. It consists of a hollow long tube with both ends open or with one end open and the other closed. The relationship between the incident wave and the reflected wave depends upon whether the reflecting end of the pipe is open or closed.\n(I) If the reflecting end is open, the air molecules have complete freedom of motion and this behaves as an antinode.\n(ii) If the reflecting end is closed, then it behaves as a node because the movement of the molecules is restricted.\n\n## Modes of Vibrations\n\nStationary longitudinal waves occur in a pipe as discussed by the following two cases:\n\n## Case (1): Modes of vibrations in an organ pipe open at both ends\n\nLet us consider an organ pipe of length $\\ell$ which is open at both ends. As at the open end, an air molecule has complete freedom of motion so it acts as antinode as shown in Fig.7.8. In this figure, longitudinal waves set up inside the pipe have been represented by transverse curved lines which represent the displacement and amplitude of vibration of air particles at various points along the axis of pipe.\n\n## (a) Fundamental mode of vibration\n\nIn this case, as shown in Fig. 7.8 (a), there is only one node N at the middle of the pipe. As both ends of pipe are open, there are two antinodes at both the ends. If $\\lambda_{1}$ is the wavelength of sound, then\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\ell=\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{4} \\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{4} \\\\\n& \\ell=\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{2} \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad \\lambda_{1}=2 \\ell\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf $f_{1}$ is the frequency of sound, then the velocity of sound is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v=f_{1} \\lambda_{1} \\\\\n& f_{1}=v / \\lambda_{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nPutting the value of $\\lambda_{1}$, we have\nFig. 7.8:\nStationary longitudinal waves in a pipe open at both ends.\n\n$$\nf_{1}=v / 2 \\ell\n$$\n\nThis frequency is called fundamental frequency or first harmonic.\n\n## (b) Second mode of vibration\n\nIf there are three antinodes and two nodes, frequency will be twice that of fundamental\n\nfrequency. It is second mode of vibration as shown in Fig.7.8 (b). In this case, there are three antinodes and two nodes.\nIf $\\lambda_{0}$ is the wavelength of sound, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\ell=\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{4}+\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{2}+\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{4} \\\\\n& \\ell=(1+2+1) \\quad \\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{4} \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad \\lambda_{2}=\\ell\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf $f_{2}$ is the frequency of sound, then speed $v$ of sound becomes:\n\n$$\nv=f_{2} \\lambda_{2}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nf_{2}=\\frac{v}{\\lambda_{2}}\n$$\n\nPutting the value of $\\lambda_{2}$, we have\n\n$$\nf_{2}=\\frac{v}{\\ell}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nf_{2}=2 f_{1} \\quad\\left(\\because \\frac{v}{2 \\ell}=f_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\n## (c) nth mode of vibration\n\nSimilarly, frequency for air column vibrating in $n$ loops is:\n\n$$\nf_{n}=n(v / 2 \\ell)\n$$\n\nand wavelength is\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{2}=\\frac{2 \\ell}{n}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nn=1,2,3,4,5\n$$\n\nSo, the longitudinal stationary waves have a discrete set of frequencies $f_{1}, 2 f_{1}, 3 f_{2}, \\ldots, n f_{n}$, which is known as harmonic series. The frequency $f_{1}$ is known as fundamental frequency and the others are called harmonics.\n\n## Case (2): Modes of vibration in an organ pipe closed at one end\n\nLet us consider an organ pipe of length $\\ell$ which is closed at one end. Then at the closed end, we get a node while at the open end, we get an antinode as shown in the Fig. 7.9.\n\n## (a) Fundamental mode of vibration:\n\nFundamental mode of vibration has one node and one antinode as shown in Fig.7.9 (a). If $\\lambda_{1}$ is the wavelength of fundamental mode, then length of the pipe is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\ell=\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{4} \\\\\n& \\lambda_{1}=4 \\ell\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# Physics II\n\nSo, the speed $v$ becomes:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v=f_{1} \\lambda \\\\\n& f_{1}=\\frac{v}{\\lambda_{1}} \\\\\n& f_{1}=\\frac{v}{4 \\ell} \\quad\\left(\\because \\lambda_{1}=4 \\ell\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe frequency $f_{1}$ is called fundamental frequency.\n\n## (b) Second Mode of Vibration:\n\nSecond mode of vibration contains two nodes and two anti-nodes as shown in Fig.7.9 (b).\nIf $\\lambda_{2}$ is the wavelength, then length of the pipe is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\ell=\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{4}+\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{2} \\\\\n& \\ell=\\frac{3}{4} \\lambda_{3} \\\\\n& \\lambda_{3}=\\frac{4 \\ell}{3} \\\\\n& f_{3}=\\frac{v}{\\lambda_{3}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nPutting value of $\\lambda_{3}$, we have $v=f_{3} \\lambda_{3}$\nor\n\n$$\nf_{3}=\\frac{v}{4 \\ell}\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\nf_{3}=3 f_{1} \\quad\\left[\\because \\frac{v}{4 \\ell}=f_{1}\\right]\n$$\n\nThis is called second harmonic.\n\n## (c) nth mode of vibration\n\nIf air column vibration in $n$ loops, then frequency $f_{n}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f_{n}=n\\left(\\frac{v}{4 \\ell}\\right) \\\\\n& f_{n}=n f_{1} \\quad \\text { where } n=1,3,6, \\ldots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand the wavelength $\\lambda_{n}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{n}=\\frac{4 \\ell}{n}\n$$\n\nBy studying both cases, we conclude that the pipe which is open at both ends is richer in harmonics than that of closed at one end.\nIn an organ pipe, the primary driving mechanism is wavering, sheet like jet of air from fluts-sit, which interacts with the upper lip and the air column in the pipe to maintain a steady oscillation.\n\nExample 7.4 An organ pipe has a length of 50 cm .

They are called \"micro\" waves because their wavelengths are typically of the order of millimetres or centimetres, much shorter than radiowaves. Stationary waves, also known as standing waves, can be produced by microwaves when they are confined to a specific region or cavity such as wave guides or resonant chambers. In these structures, microwaves can bounce back and forth, creating a standing wave pattern with nodes and antinodes. It occurs when the microwave frequency matches the resonant frequency of the cavity.\nThe stationary waves can be created using microwaves by the following simple method as shown in Fig. 7.10.\nFig. 7.10: Experimental setup for stationary waves using microwave\nThe experiment setup consists of a microwave source (transmitter), a probe detector and a metal reflector (a metallic plate for the reflection of microwave). Three of the mentioned are placed in line.\nThe waves coming out of microwave source are moving towards the metal plate and then reflected back. The reflected wave and incident wave superpose and create a stationary wave pattern. This can be detected by a probe detector placed between transmitter and metallic plate. The intensity of the signal can be observed by the detector. You can move the plate or detector to observe antinode and node. By finding the distance from one antinode to the next antinode, the wavelength of stationary wave can be found.\n\n# 7.8 DIFFRACTION OF WAVES\n\nDiffraction of waves is the bending of waves around the sharp edges or comers of obstacles or the spreading of waves beyond a barrier. It occurs when a wave encounters a physical barrier or an opening (a slit) that is comparable in size to the wavelength of the wave. The longer the wavelength, the greater the spreading and vice versa.\nDiffraction can be observed in various types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, light waves and electromagnetic waves.\nSome examples of the phenomenon of diffraction include:\n\n- Hearing of sound waves around comers or through door way from where they were generated as sound waves bend around the comers.\n- Diffraction of X-rays by crystals as the spacing between the regular arrays of atoms is of the order of X-rays wavelength.\nDiffraction is a fundamental aspect of wave behaviour and has many practical applications in various fields.\n\n## The Ripple Tank\n\nFigure 7.11 shows a ripple tank. It is a very useful apparatus not only to generate water waves, but also to demonstrate wave properties (such as reflection, diffraction and refraction).\nFig. 7.11: A ripple tank\nRipple tank contains water, vibrator (e.g. a motorized oscillating needle), obstacles (e.g. a small rectangular block or a semicircular barrier) and gap widths of different sizes. It creates a series of concentric circles\nSmall gap, increased diffraction Large gap, Decreased diffraction\n\nor parallel waves using the vibrator. An obstacle is placed for creating a gap with a specific width. The experiment can be repeated with differentgap widths. It is observed that when the gap width is small compared to the wavelength, diffraction is significant and the waves bend around the obstacle, creating a semicircular pattern. As the gap width increases relative to wavelength, diffraction decreases and the waves pass through the gap with less bending.\nThis experiment demonstrates the qualitative effect of gap width on diffraction in a ripple tank, illustrating how the relationship between gap width and wavelength affects wave behaviour.\n\n# Example 7.6\n\nIn a ripple tank, a wave generator produces 500 pulses in 10 s . Find the frequency at time period of the pulses produced?\nSolution $n-500$ pulses, $t=10 \\mathrm{~s}, f=$ ?\nAs Frequency $=\\frac{\\text { Number of pulses }}{\\text { Time }}$\n\n$$\nf=\\frac{500}{10 \\mathrm{~s}}=50 \\mathrm{~Hz}\n$$\n\nWe know that: $\\quad T-\\frac{1}{f}=0.02 \\mathrm{~s}$\n\n### 7.9 BEATS\n\nWhen two waves of slightly different frequencies, travelling in the same direction overlap each other then there is a periodic variation of sound between maximum and minimum loudness which is called as beats.\nTuning forks give out pure notes (single frequency). If two tuning forks $A$ and $B$ of the same frequency say 32 Hz are sounded separately, they will give out pure notes. If they are sounded simultaneously, it will be difficult to differentiate the notes of one tuning fork from that of the other. The sound waves of the two will be superposed on each other and will be heard by the human ear as a single pure note.\nIf the tuning fork $B$ is loaded with some wax or plasticine, its frequency will be lowered slightly, say it becomes 30 Hz . If now the two tuning forks are sounded together, a note of alternately increasing and decreasing intensity will be heard. This note is called beat note or a beat which is due to interference between the sound waves from tuning forks $A$ and $B$.\n\n# Physics II\n\nFig. 7.13 (a) shows the waveform of the note emitted from a tuning fork A. Similarly, Fig. 7.13(b) shows the waveform of the note emitted by tuning fork B. When both the tuning forks $A$ and $B$ are sounded together, the resultant waveform is shown in Fig. 7.12(c). It shows how do the beat note occur. At some instant $X$, the displacement of the two waves is in the same direction. The resultant displacement is large and a loud sound is heard.\nAfter $1 / 4 \\mathrm{~s}$ the displacement of the wave due to one tuning fork is opposite to the displacement of the wave due to the other tuning fork resulting in minimum displacement at $Y$, hence, faint sound or no sound is heard.\nFig. 7.13: Formation of beats\n\nAnother $1 / 4 \\mathrm{~s}$ later, the displacements are again in the same direction and a loud sound is heard again at $Z$.\nThus, during one second, we observe two faintest sounds or two loudest. As the difference of the frequency of the two tuning forks is also 4 Hz so, we find that the number of beats per second is equal to the difference between the frequencies of the tuning forks.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f_{n}=32 \\mathrm{~Hz}, \\quad f_{a}=30 \\mathrm{~Hz} \\quad f_{n}>f_{a} \\\\\n& \\text { No. of beats }=f_{n}-f_{a}=32 \\mathrm{~Hz}-30 \\mathrm{~Hz}=2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHowever, when the difference between the frequencies of the two sounds is more than 10 Hz , it becomes difficult to recognize the beats.\nThe difference between the frequencies of the two waves is termed as beal frequency $f_{\\text {w }}$.\nOne can use beats to tune a string instrument, such as piano or violin, by beating a note against a note of known frequency. The string can then be adjusted to the desired frequency by tightening or loosening it until no beats are heard.\n\n# Tuning Musical Instruments\n\nHere are some examples of how beats are generated In musical instruments:\n\n1. Guitar: When playing two strings with slightly different tunings, beats are created. For example, playing a standard tuned string and a string tuned a few cents higher or lower.\n2. Piano: Playing two keys white and black, adjacent to each other, creates beats.\n3. Violin: When playing two strings with slightly different bow pressures or speeds, beats are generated.\n4. Drums: When two drums with slightly different tunings are played simultaneously, beats are created.\n5. Flute: When playing two notes with slightly different embouchure (lip and facial muscles) positions, beats are generated.\n6. Organ: When playing two pipes with slightly different tunings, beats are created.\n7. Synthesizer: Generating two oscillators with slightly different frequencies creates beats.\n\nIn each of these examples, the slight difference in frequency between the two sound sources creates a periodic increase and decrease in amplitude, resulting in a \"beat\" or pulsation effect.\n\nMusicians often use beats intentionally to create interesting rhythmic effects, add texture, or produce a sense of tension and release. However, In some cases, beats can be unwanted and may require adjustments to tuning, pitch, or playing technique to minimize their impact.\n\n# Physics II\n\nExample 7.7 Two tuning forks exhibit beats at a beat frequency of 3 Hz . The frequency of one fork is 256 Hz . Its frequency is then lowered slightly by adding a bit of wax to one of its prongs. The two forks then exhibit a beat frequency of 1 Hz . Determine the frequency of the second tuning fork.\n\nSolution Frequency of first tuning fork $=f_{1}=256 \\mathrm{~Hz}$\nBeat frequency before loading $=3 \\mathrm{~Hz}$\nBeat frequency after loading $=1 \\mathrm{~Hz}$\nFrequency of second tuning fork $=f_{2}=$ ?\nAs\n\n$$\nf_{1}-f_{2}= \\pm n\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\nf_{3}=f_{1} \\pm n\n$$\n\nPutting the values, we have\n\n$$\nf_{3}=256 \\mathrm{~Hz} \\pm 3 \\mathrm{~Hz}\n$$\n\nEither\n\n$$\nf_{3}=256 \\mathrm{~Hz}+3 \\mathrm{~Hz}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nf_{2}=256 \\mathrm{~Hz}-3 \\mathrm{~Hz}\n$$\n\n$$\nf_{3}=259 \\mathrm{~Hz} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad 253 \\mathrm{~Hz}\n$$\n\nIn 1711. F. J. Shore, who was a royal trumpeter and lutenist invented tuning forks.\n\nLet us consider 259 Hz as correct answer (i.e. frequency of second tuning fork). When first fork is loaded with wax, the frequency of first fork must fall below 256 Hz i.e., 255 Hz , 254 Hz and thus the number of beats produced per second will increase and will be greater than 3 beats. Since the number of beats per second decreases on loading first fork is one, therefore 259 Hz is not correct frequency of second tuning fork.\nThus, Correct frequency $=f_{2}=253 \\mathrm{~Hz}$\n\n### 7.10 INTENSITY (I) OF A WAVE\n\nIntensity is defined as the amount of energy transmitted per unit area per unit time in the direction of propagation of progressive wave.\nIt is a measure of the power of a wave and is usually denoted by the symbol \" $I$ \". It is measured in units of watts per square metre $\\left(\\mathrm{Wm}^{2}\\right)$.\nA progressive wave or travelling wave is one that travels through a medium in a consistent direction and transferring energy from one point to another. It is a wave that propagates or moves forward, as opposed to a stationary or standing wave. Examples of progressive waves include water waves, sound waves, light waves, etc.\nBy definition, the intensity of a wave is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I=\\frac{E}{A \\times t} \\\\\n& I-\\frac{E_{t}}{A}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\nI=\\begin{array}{ll}\nP \\\\\nA\n\\end{array}\\left(\\because F_{f}=P\\right)\n$$\n\nHere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I=\\text { Intensity of wave in }\\left(\\mathrm{W} \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& E=\\text { Energy in joules (J) } \\\\\n& t=\\text { Time in seconds (s) } \\\\\n& P=\\text { Power in watts ( } \\mathrm{W})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe know that in mechanical waves, such as sound waves, water waves, or waves on a vibrating string, energy is stored as kinetic energy and potential energy of the medium's particles. How much energy is stored depends upon the displacement (amplitude) of the particles from the mean position. Therefore, the intensity I of waves is proportional to the square of the amplitude A, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n& I \\propto A^{2} \\\\\n\\text { or } & I=k A^{2} \\ldots \\ldots(7.14)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nHere $k$ is the constant of proportionality and depends upon the physical properties of the wave and the medium.\n\n# Example 7.8\n\n(a) A wave has an intensity of $0.5 \\mathrm{~W} \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$ at a distance of 3.0 m from the source.

If the sound waves are spreading out evenly in all directions and the intensity of the sound waves is measured at a distance of 5 m from the speaker, what is the intensity of the sound waves if the area of the sphere (the surface area of a sphere) at that distance is approximately $314 \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$ ?\n\n| Solution | Power $P=50 \\mathrm{~W}$ |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Area $A=314 \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$ |  |\n|  | Intensity $=$ | Power <br> Area |\n|  | $I=\\frac{P}{A}$ |  |\n|  | $I=\\frac{50 \\mathrm{~W}}{314 \\mathrm{~m}^{2}}$ |  |\n|  | $f \\approx 0.159 \\mathrm{~W} \\mathrm{~m}^{-2}$ |  |\n\n# 7.11 DOPPLER EFFECT\n\nThe apparent change in the frequency (or pitch) of waves due to the relative motion between the source and observer (listener) is called Doppler Effect.\nThis effect was first observed by John Doppler while he was observing the frequency of light emitted from a star. In some cases, the frequency of emitted light was found to be slightly different from that emitted from a similar source on the Earth. He found that the change of frequency of light depends upon motion of star relative to Earth.\nThis effect can be observed with sound waves also. For example, when an observer is standing on a railway platform, the pitch of whistle of an engine coming towards the platform appears to become higher to an observer standing on the platform. However, the pitch of whistle of an engine going away from the platform appears to become lower to an observer standing on the platform.\nConsider a source of sound $S$ at rest which emits sound waves having wavelength $\\lambda$. Let speed of the sound for a stationary observer (i.e., listener) is $v$ then the number of waves received by observer in one second i.e., frequency $f$ is:\n\n$$\nf=\\frac{v}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\n# Case 1: When source of sound moves towards the stationary observer\n\nWhen the source moves towards the stationary observer $A$ with velocity $u_{x}$ then waves are compressed and their wavelength is decreased as shown in Fig. 7.14. In this case, the waves are compressed by an amount given as\n\n$$\nA \\lambda=\\frac{u_{x}}{f}\n$$\n\nThe compression of the waves is due to the fact that same number of waves are contained in a shorter space depending upon the velocity of the source. The wavelength observed by the observer A is then,\nor\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{A}=\\lambda-\\Delta \\lambda\n$$\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{A}=\\frac{v}{f}-\\frac{u_{x}}{f}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{A}=\\frac{v-u_{x}}{f}\n$$\n\nHere $\\Delta \\lambda$ is the decrease in wavelength in one second and is called Doppler shift.\nFig. 7.14\nA source moving with velocity $u_{x}$ towards a stationary observer $A$ and away from stationary observer B respectively. Observer A hears an increased and observer B hears a decreased frequency.\n\nThus, the number of waves received by observer $A$ in one second (i.e., changed or apparent frequency) is\n\n$$\nf_{A}=\\frac{v}{\\lambda_{A}}\n$$\n\nPutting the value of $\\lambda_{A}$, we have\n\nAs\n\n$$\nf_{A}=\\left[\\frac{v}{\\left(v-u_{x}\\right)_{f}}\\right]\n$$\n\n$$\nf_{A}=\\left[\\frac{v}{v-u_{x}}\\right] f\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{v}{v-u_{x}}>1\n$$\n\nTherefore\n\n$$\nf_{A}>f\n$$\n\nThus, the apparent frequency of sound heard by the observer increases which in turn will increase the pitch of sound.\n\n## Case 2: When source of sound moves away from the stationary observer\n\nWhen the source moves away from the stationary observer $B$ with velocity $u_{x}$, then waves are expanded and their wavelength is increased. In this case, the waves\n\n# Phycles II\n\nexpanded by an amount:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{3}=\\frac{u_{2}}{f}\n$$\n\nThe expansion of the waves is due to the fact that same number of waves are now contained in a large distance. The wavelength observed by the observed $B$ is then,\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{B}=\\lambda+\\Delta \\lambda\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta \\lambda$ is the increase in wavelength in one second and is called Doppler shift.\nThus, the number of waves received by observer B in one second (i.e. changed or apparent frequency) is:\n\n$$\nf_{B}=\\frac{v}{\\lambda_{B}}\n$$\n\nPutting the value of $\\lambda_{3}$, we have\n\nAs\nTherefore\n\n$$\nf_{N}=\\left[\\frac{v}{\\left(v+u_{2}\\right)_{f}}\\right]\n$$\n\n$$\nf_{B}=\\left[\\frac{v}{\\left(v+u_{2}\\right)}\\right] f\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{v}{v+u_{2}}<1\n$$\n\nThus, the apparent frequency of sound heard by the observer decreases which in turn will decrease the pitch of sound.\n\n## Info Comer\n\nHearing Ranges\n\n| Organisms | Frequencies in Hz |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| Dolphin | $150-150,000$ |\n| Bat | $1000-120,000$ |\n| Cat | $60-70,000$ |\n| Dog | $15-50,000$ |\n| Human | $20-20,000$ |\n\n(a)\n(b)\nAs a plane accelerates, it builds up a front of atr pressure by pushing atr in front of it.

One of its important applications is the radar system, which uses radio waves to determine the elevation and speed of an aeroplane. RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging) is a device, which transmits and receives radio waves. If an aeroplane approaches towards the radar, then the wavelength of the wave reflected from aeroplane (a) would be shorter and if it moves away, then the wavelength would be larger as shown in Fig.7.15 (a) \\& Fig.7.15 (b), respectively. Similarly, speed of satellites moving around the Earth can also be (b) determined by the same principle.\nFig. 7.15:\nA frequency shift is used in a radar to detod the motion of an aeroplane.\n\nSONAR is an acronym derived from \"Sound Navigation And Ranging\". It is the general name for sonic or ultrasonic underwater echo-ranging and echo-scunding system. Sonar is the name of a technique for detecting the presence of objects under water by acoustical echo. In Sonar, \"Doppler detection\" relies upon the relative speed of the target and the detector to provide an indication of the target speed. It employs the Doppler effect, in which an apparent change in frequency occurs when the source and the observer are in relative motion to one another. Its known military applications include the detection and location of submarines, control of antisubmarine weapons, mine hunting and depth measurement of sea.\nIn Astronomy, astronomers use the Doppler effect to calculate the speeds of distant stars and galaxies. By comparing the line spectrum of light from the star with light from a laboratory source, the Doppler shift of the star's light can be measured. Then, the speed of the star can be calculated.\n(i) Stars moving away from the Earth show a red shift as shown in Fig.7.16(b). The emitted waves have a longer wavelength than if the star had been at rest. So, the spectrum is shifted towards longer wavelength, i.e., towards the red end of the spectrum. Astronomers have also discovered that all the distant galaxies are moving away from us and by measuring their red shifts, they have estimated their speeds.\n(ii) Stars moving towards the Earth show a blue shift as shown in Fig.7.16(c). This is because the wavelength of light emitted by the star are shorter than if the star had been at rest. So, the spectrum is shifted towards shorter wavelength, I.e., to the blue end of the spectrum.\nAnother important application of the Doppler shift using electromagnetic waves is the radar speed trap. Microwaves are emitted from a transmitter in short bursts. Each burst is reflected off by any car in the path of microwaves in between sending out bursts. The transmitter is open to detect reflected microwaves. If the reflection is caused by a moving obstacle, the reflected microwaves are Doppler shifted. By measuring the Doppler shift, the speed at which the car moves is\nFig. 7.16\n\ncalculated by computer programme.\nSatellite Navigation uses Doppler shift to determine satellite velocity and position, enabling accurate location tracking.\nSatellite Communication also uses Doppler shift compensation ensuring stable communication signals.\nDoppler radar detects wind velocity and precipitation patterns. Doppler shift helps measure Earth's surface velocity and deformation.\nDoppler echocardiography measures blood flow velocity and detects cardiac abnormalities, such as valve stenosis or regurgitation. Doppler echocardiography optimizes pacemaker settings.\nDoppler ultrasound measures blood flow and calculates cardiac output. Doppler ultrasound detects vascular stenosis or occlusion.\n\nExample 7.12 The wavelength of one of its lines of the absorption spectrum of a faint galaxy is identified as $\\mathrm{Ca}-\\alpha$ line found to be 478 nm .

These phenomena, however, do not tell us whether the light waves are longitudinal or transverse. Polarization of light suggests that the light waves are transverse in character.\n\nIn transverse mechanical waves, such as produced in a stretched string, the vibrations of the particles of the medium are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the waves. The vibrations can be confined along vertical, horizontal or any other direction (Fig. 8.1). In each of these cases, the transverse mechanical wave is said to be\nFig. 8.1: Transverse waves on a string polarized (a) in a vertical plane, and (b) in a horizontal plane\n\npolarized. The plane of polarization is the plane containing the direction of vibration of the particles of the medium and the direction of propagation of the wave.\nA light wave produced by oscillating charge consists of a periodic variation of the electric field vector $E$ accompanied by the magnetic field vector $B$ at right angles to it. Ordinary light has components of vibration in all possible planes. Such a light is unpolarized. On the other hand, if the vibrations are confined only in one plane, the light is said to be polarized. Unpolarized light is shownin Fig. 8.2.\nExamples of unpolarized light sources are sunlight, incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent light bulbs, light from a candle or fire.\nFig. 8.2: An unpolarized light, due to incandescent bulb, has vibrations in all planes.\n\nPolarization is the process by which the electric and magnetic vibrations of light waves are restricted to a single plane of vibration. It is the property exhibited only by transverse waves such as light waves. It does not occur for longitudinal waves such as sound waves.\n\n# How an Unpolarized Light be Polarized?\n\nAn unpolarized light can be made polarized by the following methods:\n\n1. Passing light through a polarizing filter (e.g, polaroid sheet).\n2. Using a polarizing beam splitter.\n3. Employing certain optical crystals or materials (e.g., calcite, quartz, etc.).\n\nThe most common method by which an unpolarized light can be polarized is by passing it through a polarizing filter, such as a polarizing beam splitter or a polaroid sheet. When an unpolarized light passes through the polarized filter, only that electric field vector which is parallel to the axis of polarized filter can pass through it, while all other vectors are blocked. The resultant light then becomes polarized as shown in Fig. 8.3.\nThus, in simple words, the process of transforming an unpolarized light into a polarized light is said to be polarization.\nFig. 8.3: Polarization of light using a polarized filter\n\nThe orientation of the electric field vector $E$ of light waves in a specific direction is the basis of Polarization.\n\n# 8.2 TYPES OF POLARIZATION\n\nHere are the basic types of polarization of light.\n\n## 1. Linear Polarization\n\nWhen the electric field vector oscillates in a single plane, light is said to be linearly polarized as shown in Fig.8.4 (a). Example is the light passing through a polarizing filter, like sunglasses.\n\n## 2. Circular Polarization\n\nWhen the electric field rotates circularly, either clockwise (right-handed), or counterclockwise (left-handed), the light is said to be circularly polarized as shown in Fig.8.4 (b). Example is the light reflected off a CD (Compact Disc) or DVD (Digital Versatile Disc).\n\n## 3. Elliptical Polarization\n\nA combination of linear and circular polarization, where the electric field vector traces an elliptical path is called elliptical polarization. In elliptical polarization as shown in Fig.8.4(c), the two components of electric field $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ are not equal or they differ in phase by an arbitrary angle $\\theta$. Example is the light passing through a stress plate or a waveplate.\nFig. 8.4 (a): Circular polarization of light\nFig. 8.4 (c): Elliptical polarization of light\n\n### 8.3 PRODUCTION AND DETECTION OF PLANE POLARIZED LIGHT\n\nThe light emitted by an ordinary incandescent bulb is unpolarized, because its electrical vibrations are randomly oriented in space as shown in Fig.8.2.\nIf unpolarized light is made incident on a sheet of polaroid (polarizer), the transmitted light will be plane polarized. If a second sheet of polaroid (analyzer) is placed in such a way that the axes of the two polaroids shown by stralght lines drawn on them are parallel (Fig. 8.5-a), the light is transmitted through the second polaroid. If the second polaroid (analyzer) is slowly rotated about the beam of light as axis of rotation, the light emerging from the second polaroid gets dimmer and dimmer and ultimately disappears when the axes become mutually perpendicular as shown in Fig. 8.5(b), the light reappears on\n\nfurther rotation and becomes brightest when the axes are again parallel to each other.\nThis experiment proves that light waves are transverse waves. If the light waves were longitudinal, they would never disappear even if the two polaroids were mutually perpendicular.\nLight reflected from smooth surface of water is partially polarized parallel to the surface.\nFig. 8.5:\nExperimental arrangement to show that light waves are transverse. The lines with arrows indicate electric vibrations of light waves.\n\n# 8.4 POLARIZATION OF LIGHT BY THE METHOD OF REFLECTION\n\nIn 1808, Malus discovered that polarized light is obtained when ordinary light is reflected by a plane sheet of glass. If the reflected light is viewed through a polaroid which is slowly rotated about the line of vision, the light is practically extinguished at a certain\nFig. 8.6: Plane polarization by reflection\n\norientation of the polaroid. The most suitable angle of incidence ' $i$ ' is about $57^{\\circ}$ for glass for which the reflected ray becomes plane polarized, as illustrated by ray diagram in Fig. (8.6). This proves that the light reflected by the glass is practically plane polarized. Light reflected from the surface of a table becomes darker when viewed through a rotated polaroid, showing that it is partially plane polarized.\n\n# Brewster's Law\n\nThe particular angle of incidence on a transparent medium when the reflected light is almost plane polarized is called the polarizing angle. Let a beam of unpolarized light be made incident on the surface of medium 2 as shown in Fig.8.6. If the reflected beam of light is almost plane polarized, the reflected and refracted beams are at right angles to each other at the polarizing angle, $i=\\theta_{p}$. Thus\n\n$$\n\\theta_{p}+\\theta_{r}=90^{\\circ}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\theta_{r}=90^{\\circ}-\\theta_{p}\n$$\n\nFrom Snell's law,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& n_{1} \\sin \\theta_{p}=n_{2} \\sin \\theta_{r} \\\\\n& n_{1} \\sin \\theta_{p}=n_{1} \\sin \\left(90^{\\circ}-\\theta_{p}\\right) \\\\\n& n_{1} \\sin \\theta_{p}=n_{2} \\cos \\theta_{p} \\\\\n& \\frac{\\sin \\theta_{p}}{\\cos \\theta_{p}}=\\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} \\\\\n& \\tan \\theta_{p}=\\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMolus's law is used to study the polarization of light in biological systems, such as the polarization of light by cell membranes.\n\nThis equation is known as Brewster's law. In this equation, $n_{1}$ is refractive index of medium 1 and $n_{2}$ is refractive index of medium 2. If medium 1 is air, then equation becomes $\\tan \\theta_{p}=n$ because $n_{1}=1$ and $n_{2}=n$. Here $n$ is refractive index of medium on which light is incident. Hence, Brewester proved that the tangent of the angle of polarization is numerically equal to the refractive index of the medium 2 when medium 1 is air. In Brewster's law, the angle ' $\\theta_{p}$ ' for which the reflected ray and the refracted ray make an angle of $90^{\\circ}$ between them, is also called the Brewster angle $\\theta_{B}$. Then, $\\tan \\theta_{p}=n$ holds.\n\nExample 8.1 A beam of light strikes the surface of a plate of glass with a refractive index of $\\sqrt{3}$ at the polarizing angle. What will be the angle of refraction of the wave of light?\n\nSolution\n\nAs\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nn & =\\sqrt{3}, \\theta_{r}=? \\\\\n\\tan \\theta_{B} & =n \\\\\n\\theta_{B} & =\\tan ^{-1}(\\sqrt{3}) \\\\\n\\theta_{B} & =60^{\\circ} \\\\\n\\theta_{r} & =90^{\\circ}-\\theta_{B}, \\quad \\theta_{r}=90^{\\circ}-60^{\\circ} \\\\\n\\theta_{r} & =30^{\\circ}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\theta_{p}=90^{\\circ}-\\theta_{B}\n$$\n\n# 8.5 MALUS'S LAW\n\nMalus's law states that the intensity $I$ of plane polarized light after passing through an analyzer is directly proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle $\\theta$ between the transmission axis of the analyzer and polarizer. That is;\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I \\propto \\cos ^{2} 0 \\\\\n& I=I_{0} \\cos ^{2} \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{0}=$ Intensity of the incident polarized light.\nActually, Malus's law gives a mathematical relation between the intensity of the light incident on the first polaroid (i.e., polarizer) and the intensity of light obtained after passing it\nFig 8.7 (a): Schematic representation of Malus's law\nthrough the second polaroid (i.e., analyzer). This is shown in Fig. 8.7(a). An analyzer is also a polarizer that is placed after a polarizer. Rotation of the analyzer affects the intensity of the polarized light. It is used to further reduce the intensity of light and also adjustit by adjusting the angle of the analyzer with respect to the polarizer.\nCertain transparent crystalline materials, like tourmaline, calcite crystals, etc., are capable of confining vibrations of light waves in only one plane. Such materials are called polaroids which have high directionality in crystal structure. Light can also be polarized by natural phenomena like reflection, refraction and scattering.\nIf a piece of polaroid is rotated in front of a polarized ray of light, it causes a variation in the intensity of the light that gets through. The reason that causes the variation of intensity is the angle between the initial polarizer and the axis of second polarizer.\nWhen the incident polarized light of amplitude $A_{0}$ strikes the analyzer at an angle $\\theta$, it is resolved into two components $A_{0} \\cos \\theta$ and $A_{0} \\sin \\theta$ as shown in Fig. 8.7(b). The component $A_{0} \\sin \\theta$ is absorbed in the analyzer. Since, only $A_{0} \\cos \\theta$ passes through the analyzer, the amplitude $A$ of the transmitted light is therefore,\nFig.8.7(b): Resolution of amplitude into components of plane polarization light.\n\n$$\nA=A_{0} \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\nSince intensity $I$ is proportional to the square of the amplitude $A$. it can be expressed as:\n\n# Physics II\n\n$I \\propto A^{2}$ or $I=k A^{2}$\nwhere $k=1$, we can write; $I=A^{2}$\nor $\\quad I=A_{0}^{2} \\cos ^{2} \\theta$\n\n$$\nI=I_{0} \\cos ^{2} \\theta\\left(\\because I_{0}=A_{0}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere $I_{0}$ is the intensity of the incident polarized light.\nThere are two extreme conditions of $\\theta$ followed by the above equation given as,\ni. If $\\theta=0^{\\circ}$, then $I=I_{0}$. This means the Intensity transmitted through the analyzer is equal to the initial light intensity that passes through the polarizer.\ni. If $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$, then $I=0$. This means the light is extinguished completely, i.e., no light is allowed to pass through the analyzer.\n\n## Optical Activity\n\nOptical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through it. The rotation is detected with a polarizer or analyzer as shown in Fig. 8.6.\nMany crystals and solutions rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through them. Such substances are said to be optically active. Examples are quartz crystals, cinnabar $\\left(H_{2} S\\right)$, sugar water, insulin and collagen. The amount and direction of rotation depends on following factors:\n(i) The type of substance\n(ii) The concentration of the substance (the amount of a substance present in a given quantity of a mixture or solution).\n(iii) The distance the light travels through it, and\n(iv) The wavelength of light.\n\nOptical activity occurs due to the asymmetric shape of molecules in the substance, such as being helical. A few millimetre thickness of such crystals will rotate the plane\nSugar solution rotates the plane of polarization of incident light so that it is no longer horizontal but at an angle $\\theta$. The analyzer thus stops the light when rotated from the vertical (crossed) positions.\n\n# Physica II\n\nof polarization by many degrees. Certain organic substances, such as sugar and tartaric acid, show optical rotation when they are in a solution. This property of optically active substances can be used to determine their concentration in the solutions.\nExample 8.2 Find the refractive index of a medium if polarizing angle is $54.5^{\\circ}$.\n\n## Solution\n\n$$\n\\theta_{n}=54.5^{\\circ}, n=?\n$$\n\nAs\n\n$$\n\\tan \\theta_{n}=n\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nn=\\tan \\theta_{n}\n$$\n\nSo\n\n$$\nn=\\tan 54.5^{\\circ}\n$$\n\n$$\nn=1.4\n$$\n\nExample 8.3 Polarized light with an intensity of 75 W $\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ passes through an analyzer with its axis at $30^{\\circ}$ to the polarizer's axis.

Tell the polarization state of the scattered light.\n\n## Importance of Polarization\n\nThe immense significance of polarization of light may be justified by various fields:\n\n# 1. Optics and Photonics\n\nPolarization is essential for applications like polarized sunglasses, LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screens, and optical communication systems.\n\n## 2. Imaging and Microscopy\n\nPolarization enhances image quality, reducing glare (unwanted light that interferes with vision) and improving contrast, especially in microscopy and medical imaging.\n\n## 3. Medical Applications\n\nPolarization is used in cancer diagnosis, tissue imaging, and laser surgery, leveraging its ability to distinguish between different tissue types.\n\n## 4. Astronomy\n\nPolarization helps us to analyze cosmic phenomena, like the polarization of light from distant stars or the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\n## 5. Miscellaneous Fields\n\nPolarization has importance in miscellaneous fields such as optics and photonics, imaging and microscopy, biology and chemistry, communication system, etc.\n\n## Two Main Applications of Polarization\n\nPolarizers, also known as polarizing filters, have two main applications:\n\n## 1. Sky Photography\n\nA camera which is used to photograph the clouds is fitted with a polaroid. The light coming from the sky is polarized by the polaroid.\nIn sky photography, polarizers are used to reduce the glare and haze which are produced by the scattering of light by small particles of molecules present in the atmosphere. Polarizers also enhance the contrast by clocking the excessive bright white light while allowing the other colours to pass through, thus creating a brighter detailed image. Thus, allows to improve the overall image quality.\n\n## 2. Stress Analysis of Materials\n\nIn materials science, polarizers are used to analyze the stress and strain on materials, such as plastics, metals, and glass.\nWhen a material is stressed, its molecular structure changes, affecting the way, it\n\ninteracts with light, and interference patterns on fringes are formed which in turn gives qualitative information about the material. By shining polarized light through the transparent material and analyzing the changes in the light's polarization, the researchers can:\n\n- determine the material's stress patterns\n- identify potential weaknesses or defects\n- analyze the material's optical properties\n- understand how the material will behave under different conditions. This technique is known as \"photoelasticity\" and is widely used in fields like engineering, materials science, and quality control.\nIn both cases described above, polarizers play a crucial role in manipulating light to achieve specific goals, whether it is enhancing image quality or analyzing material properties.\n\n# 8.6 GRAVITATIONAL WAVES (GWs)\n\nA gravitational wave is a stretching and compressing of space-time and can be observed by measuring the change in length between two objects.\nGravitational waves (GWs) are actually:\n\"Ripples in the fabric of space-time, produced by violent cosmic events, like colliding black holes or neutron stars that travel at the speed of light, carrying information about their source.\"\nThe simplest example to understand GWs is given below:\nAlbert Einstein (1878-1955)\nA German born Theoretical Physicist\nOne of the World's renowned scientists.\n\nIf we throw a stone into a pond, the stone creates ripples on the water surface (space-time). These ripples travel outward, carrying information about the stone (the cosmic event). They can be detected on the shore by (gravitational wave observatories), revealing the stone's presence and properties.\n\n## Prediction and Detection\n\nGravitational waves are a prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity which is confirmed by observations and is opening a new window into the universe's most extreme phenomena.\nAccording to Einstein's general theory of relativity, gravity is not a force, but a curvature of space-time caused by massive bodies. Gravity is like a dent in a mattress. Heavy things wrap the space around them, and that is why we feel gravity.\nGravitational waves, as initially predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916, are ripples in spacetime that were first detected in 2015, but announced in 2016, the first\n\n# Physics II\n\nobservation of its kind: the detection of gravitational waves, produced from two colliding neutron stars. In this type, there is a gradual increase in frequency and amplitude of GWs.\nA Binary System (BS) in the context of gravitational waves refers to \"a system consisting of two compact objects, such as black holes, neutron stars, or white dwarfs, which are orbiting each other and emitting gravitational waves.\"\n\n## Four Basic Types of GWs\n\nThere are four basic types of gravitational waves, each with different sources and characteristics:\n\n## 1. Continuous GWs\n\nDr. Nergis Mavalwala is a Pakistani-American Astrophysics at MIT known for her work on gravitational waves\n\nWhen a single massive object spins with a constant rate, such as a neutron star, continuous GWs are produced with a constant frequency and amplitude. White dwarf binary systems produce continuous GWs.\n\n## 2. Compact Binary Inspirational GWs\n\nWhen a binary system, such as binary neutron stars, binary black holes, or a neutron star and black hole orbiting each other, compact inspirational GWs are produced.\n\n## 3. Burst GWs\n\nThese are produced by violent events like supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, or cosmic strings.\n\n## 4. Stochastic GWs\n\nBS Model\n\nStochastic GWs are weak, random signals of GWs which are produced by superposition of many weak gravitational wave sources, such as distant binary systems. These GWs are the most difficult to detect.\nEvery physical object that accelerates, produces gravitational waves. Vehicles, airplanes, etc. are included in it. The masses and acceleration of objects on the Earth are too small to make gravitational waves big enough to be detected with our instruments.\n\nAs the binary systems (also termed as binaries) orbit each other, they emit gravitational waves, which can be detected by observatories like LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory) which is situated in USA and Virgo, a large scale gravitational wave observatory in Cascina, Italy. The waves carry information about the system's mass, spin, and merger dynamics, offering insights into these extreme cosmic objects, and move with the speed of light.\nPicture of a series of concentric spheres, with the binary system at the center, radiating gravity waves outward into the cosmos.\n\nThe binary systems are significant sources of gravitational waves, and their mergers (collision and union of two massive objects resulting more massive single object) are among the most intense cosmic events.\n\nAs the masses orbit and accelerate, their gravitational intensity fluctuates, generating waves that radiate outward in all directions. These waves are not bound by the binary system's gravity; instead, they travel freely through spacetime at the speed of light. The waves propagate through the universe, weakening in intensity as they distance themselves from the source.\n\nThe characteristics of GWs depend on the system's properties, such as:\nTidal forces carry the mathematical signature of gravitational waves.\n\n- Masses of the objects\n- Orbital period and frequency\n- Eccentricity of the orbit: Eccentricity $e$ is a measure of the amount by which an object deviates from a perfect circle.\n\n| $e=0$ | Circular orbit |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| $e=1$ | Parabolic trajectory |\n| $e>1$ | Hyperbolic trajectory |\n| $0<e<1$ | Elliptical orbit |\n\n# Space-time Distortion/Tidal Forces\n\nGravitational waves passing through a body with mass can cause the body to experience periodic stretching and compressing, also known as \"space-time distortion\". This effect is known as \"tidal forces\" and is a result of the gravitational wave's oscillating nature. As the gravitational wave passes through\nSpacetime curve of an artificial and a natural satellite\nthe body, it causes the space-time around the body to oscillate, leading to a periodic stretching and compressing of the body in the direction perpendicular to the wave's propagation. This effect is similar to how the tides on Earth are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun.\nThe amount of stretching and compressing depends on the strength of the gravitational wave, as well as the mass and size of the body. This effect is an important prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity.\nGravitational waves generated by far off celestial events, such as the merger of two black holes or neutron stars, pass through the Earth. However, the amplitude of these waves is extremely small, typically of the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2}$ metres. This means that the\nSpacetime curve shown by two satellites\ndistortion caused by the gravitational wave is incredibly tiny, and requires extremely sensitive instruments to detect.\nDespite their small amplitude, gravitational waves offer a unique window into the universe, allowing us to study strong-field gravity, to test general relativity, and to explore the universe in ways previously impossible.\n\n### 8.7 INTERFEROMETER\n\nAn interferometer is an optical tool used in detecting gravitational waves. It is a very sensitive detection device that may use the interference of LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiatoin) beams. The basic LIGO interferometer can be seen in Fig. 8.9.\nAn interferometer that detects gravitational waves is a highly sensitive instrument that uses LASER light to measure tiny changes in distance between mirrors, caused by gravitational waves passing through the detectors. These interferometers are called\n\n# Physics II\n\nLIGO (LASER Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory). The main differences between LIGO and conventional interferometers are:\n(a) LIGO is 1000 times larger than conventional device, and\n(b) LIGO uses LASER whereas conventional interferometer has normal light source.\n\n## Basic Components of GW Interferometer\n\nThe basic components of a gravitational wave interferometer are:\nFig. 8.9: Basic LIGO interferometer\n\n1. Laser that produces a stable and high intensity beam of light.\n2. Power recycling mirror continually reflects LASER light that has already travelled through the instrument back into the interferometer and hence the term recycling is used.\n3. Beam splitter divides the LASER beam into two perpendicular beams.\n4. Mirrors reflect the beams, creating two perpendicular arms.\n5. Fabry Perot cavity consists of two mirrors facing each other. The purpose of the cavity is to enhance the path length.\n6. Photodetectors measure the returning beams, detecting tiny phase shifts (if any).\n7. Arm cavities enhance the LASER light, increasing sensitivity.\n\n## Working of Interferometer\n\nA laser beam is split into two perpendicular beams, each travelling down two identical paths (arms) of the interferometer. The beams bounce off mirrors at the ends of each arm and return to the starting point, where they are recombined. If a gravitational wave passes through, it causes a tiny disturbance in the distance between the mirrors, resulting in a phase shift between the two beams.\nWhen the beams recombine, they create an interference pattern, which is measured by a photodetector. The tiny phase shift caused by the gravitational wave alters the interference pattern, allowing the detector to sense the wave's presence.\nFigure 8.9 is a simple figure of an interferometer, but in reality, it is much more complex. On 14 September 2015, the universe's gravitational waves were observed for the very first time by LIGO. The gravitational waves which were predicted by Albert Einstein\n\n100 years ago, came from a collision between two black holes. It took 1.3 billion years for the waves to arrive at the LIGO detector in the USA. On their work on observation of GWs, Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barisk and Kip S. Throne received Nobel Prize in 2017. It is interesting to note that one of the team members, Nergis Mavalwala a professor at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), belongs to Pakistan.\n\n# Virgo Detection\n\nSimilar to LIGO, there is another facility for measuring gravitational waves. This is called Virgo, which works under the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO) Cascina near Pisa, Italy. Virgo is also an interferometer with two arms of 3 km whereas LIGO has 4 km arms. The Virgo Observatory is named after the Virgo constellation, which is visible in the night sky during the months of March, April and May. The Virgo cluster is a group of about 1,500 galaxies about 50 MLYs (Million Light Years) away. Remember one Light Year (LY) is a distance which light travels in one year. The approximate value of $1 \\mathrm{LY}=9.5$ billion km . Virgo has been involved in detecting gravitational wave events, with the first detection in 2017.\n\nExample 8.5 If the gravitational waves have a wavelength of 4000 km , find their frequency.\n\nSolution $\\lambda=4000 \\mathrm{~km}=4 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m}, c=3 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}, f=$ ?\nAs $\\quad v=f \\lambda$\nor $\\quad f=\\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\quad(\\because v=c)$\n$\\because \\quad f=\\frac{3 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}}{4 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~m}}$\n$f=0.75 \\times 10^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$\n$f=75 \\mathrm{~Hz}$\nExample 8.6 A binary system emits gravitational\nwaves with a frequency of $10^{-1} \\mathrm{~Hz}$.

The charge on a proton is $e^{\\prime}$ and that on an electron is $e^{\\prime \\prime}$. Its value is; $e=1.6 \\times 10^{-3}$ C where C (coulomb) is the SI unit of charge. This charge (e) is the smallest amount of free charge that has been discovered. Charges of larger magnitude are built up on an object by adding or removing electrons. It is the minimum amount of charge that any\n\n# (1)\n\nparticle may contain. Thus, any amount of charge $q$ is an integer multiple of $e$, i.e.,\n\n$$\nq=N e \\quad \\text { where } N \\text { is an integer }\n$$\n\nElectrostatics is the study of phenomena and properties of electric charges at rest. When charges are in motion, we call it as an electric current.\n\n## Charles de Coulomb (1736-1806)\n\nCoulomb's major contribution to science was in the field of electrostatics and magnetism. During his lifetime, he also investigated the strengths of material and determined the forces that effect on beams, thereby, contributing to the field of structural mechanics. In the field of ergonomics, his research provided a fundamental understanding of the ways in which people can best do work.\n\n### 9.1 COULOMB'S LAW\n\nCoulomb's law is a fundamental principle in electrostatics that quantifies the force between two charged objects. The first measurement of the force between electric charges was made by a French Physicist Charles de Coulomb in 1874. Coulomb's law is essential in understanding the behaviour of charged particles and the interactions that govern many electrical phenomena. On the basis of these measurements, he deduced a law known as Coulomb's law. It states that:\nThe force between two-point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. It is mathematically expressed as\nFig. 9.1\n(a) Repulsive forces between like charges and\n(b) attractive forces between unlike charges.\n\n$$\nF \\propto \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \\text { or } \\quad F=k \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $F$ is the magnitude of the mutual force that acts on each of the two point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}$, and $r$ is the distance between them. The force $F$ always acts along the line joining the two point charges (Fig. 9.1), $k$ is the constant of proportionality. Its value depends upon the nature of medium between the two charges and system of units in which $F, q$ and $r$ are measured. If the medium between the two point charges is free space and the system of units is SI, then $k$ is represented as\n\n$$\nk=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is an electrical constant, known as permittivity of free space. In SI units, its value is $8.85 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{C}^{2} \\mathrm{~N}^{-1} \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Substituting the value of $\\varepsilon_{0}$ the constant\n\n$$\nk-\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}}-9 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~N} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\mathrm{C}^{2}\n$$\n\nThus, Coulomb's force in free space is\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}\n$$\n\n## Point to ponder?\n\nDoes an electrostatic force exist between a charged and an uncharged?\n\nAs stated earlier, Coulombs' force is mutual force, it means that if $q_{1}$ exerts a force on $q_{2}$, then $q_{2}$ also exerts an equal and opposite force on $q_{1}$ if we denote the force exerted on $q_{2}$ by $q_{1}$ as $F_{21}$ and that on charge $q_{1}$ due to $q_{2}$ as $F_{12}$ then\n\n$$\nF_{12}=-F_{21}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of both these two forces is the same and is given by Eq. 9.3. To represent the direction of these forces, we introduce unit vectors. If $\\hat{r}_{21}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{1}$ to $q_{2}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{2}$ to $q_{1}$ then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F_{21}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{21} \\\\\n& F_{12}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe forces $F_{21}$ and $F_{12}$ are shown in Fig. 9.2 (a and b). It can be seen that $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{21}=-\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12}$, so Eqs. 9.5 and 9.6 show that;\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{21}=-\\mathbf{F}_{12}\n$$\n\nThe sign of the charges in Eqs. 9.5 and 9.6 determine whether the forces are attractive or repulsive.\nWe shall now consider the effect of medium between the two charges upon the Coulomb's force. If the medium is an insulator, it is usually referred as dielectric. It has been found that the presence of a dielectric always reduces the electrostatic force as compared with that in free space by a certain factor which is a constant for the given dielectric. This constant is known as relative permittivity and is represented by $\\varepsilon$. The values of relative permittivity of different dielectrics are given in Table 9.1.\nThus, the Coulomb's force in a medium of relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{r}$ is given by\n\n$$\nF_{r}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{r}} \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}\n$$\n\nIt can be seen in the table that $\\varepsilon_{r}$, for air is 1.0006 . This value is so close to one that with negligible error, the Eq. 9.3 gives the electric force in air.\n\nExample 9.3 Three point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}$ and $q_{3}$ are lying in the same plane as shown in Fig. 9.3(a). Find the magnitude and direction of the net fore acting on $q_{1}$.\n\n## Solution\n\nForce on $q_{1}$ exerted by $q_{2}$ is attractive. Let it be $F_{12}$.

It was invented by an American physicist Robert J. Van de Graff in 1920.\nThe potential difference achieved in modern Van de Graaff generators can reach 5 megavolts. A tabletop version can produce of the order of 100,000 volts and can produce enough energy to produce a visible spark.\nA pulley drives an inauiting belt by a sharply pointed metal comb which has been given a positive charge by a power supply. Electrons are removed from the belt, leaving it positively charged. A similar comb at the top allows the net positive charge to spread to the dome.\nWhy do the hairs lift when VAN DE GRAAFF GENERATOR is touched?\n\nTherefore, $B=34^{\\circ}$ with the line joining $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$.\n\n# 9.2 ELECTRIC FIELD STRENGTH\n\nWe have learnt that a charge experiences an electrostatic force in the presence of other charges. Let us consider a positively charged object $Q$. If we place a small charge $+q$ at point $A$, it will experience an electrostatic force $F$ due to the charge $Q$. Thus, an electric field is said to exist at point $A$. Coulomb's law suggests that the field gets stronger as the point $A$ gets closer to $Q$ as represented in Fig. 9.4. The strength of the field at a position is known as its intensity at that point.\nFig. 9.4\n\nThe electric intensity of the field or simply electric field at any point is defined as the force experienced by a unit positive charge placed at that point.\nElectric intensity is a force, so it is a vector quantity and is usually denoted by $E$. It can be obtained by the relation:\n\n# Physics II\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{F}{q}\n$$\n\nAs\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F-\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q Q}{r^{2}} \\quad \\therefore \\quad E-\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q}{r^{2}} \\\\\n& \\text { In vector form: } \\\\\n& E=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q}{r^{2}} \\hat{r}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 9.8, the unit of electric intensity is newton per coulomb $\\mathrm{N} \\mathrm{C}^{-1}$. The direction of $E$ is the same as that of $F$. The Eq. 9.5 can also be written as:\n\n$$\nF=q E\n$$\n\n(9.9)\n\nExample 9.2 Two positive point charges $q_{1}=16.0 \\mu \\mathrm{C}$ and $q_{2}=4.0 \\mu \\mathrm{C}$ are separated by a distance of 3.0 m , as shown in Fig.9.5. Find the spot on the line joining the two charges where electric field is zero.\nFig. 9.5\n\nSolution Between the two charges, the fields contributed by them have opposite directions, and electric field would be zero at a point $P$, where the magnitude of $E_{1}$ equals to $E_{2}$. In Fig. 9.5, let the distance of $P$ from $q_{1}$ be $d$. At $P_{1} E_{2}=E_{2}$ which implies that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q_{1}}{(3.0-d)^{2}}-\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q_{2}}{d^{2}} \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad \\frac{16.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{C}}{9.0+d^{2}-6 d}=\\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{C}}{d^{2}} \\text { or } d^{2}+2 d-3=0 \\text {, which gives } d=+1 \\mathrm{~m},-3 \\mathrm{~m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThere are two values of $d$, the negative value corresponds to a location off to the right of both the charges where magnitudes of $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are equal but directions are same. In this case $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ do not cancel at this spot. The positive value corresponds to the location shown in the figure and is the zero filed location, hence, $d=+1.0 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nExample 9.3 A proton experiences an electrostatic force equal to its weight at a particular point in an electric field. What is the field intensity at that point?\nMass of proton $=1.67 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg}$ and charge, $e=1.6 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{C}$\nUsing\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{F}{q}=\\frac{m g}{e}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values,\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{1.67 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 9.8 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{C}}=1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{NC}^{-1}\n$$\n\n## Electric Field Lines\n\nA visual representation of the electric field can be obtained in terms of electric field lines, an idea proposed by Michael Faraday. Electric field lines can be considered as a visual map used to represent the direction and strength of an electric field around a charged object. As electric field lines provide information about the electric force exerted on a\n\ncharged object, these lines are commonly called \"electric lines of force\".\nTo introduce electric field lines, we place positive test charges $+q_{0}$ each of magnitude $q_{0}$ at different places but at equal distances from a positive charge $+q$ as shown in the Fig. 9.6. Each test charge will experience a repulsive force, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 9.6(a). Therefore, the electric field created by the charge $+q$ is directed radially outward. Figure 9.6(b) shows corresponding field lines which show the field\nFig 9.6\n(a) A positive test charge $+q_{0}$ placed anywhere in the vicinity of a positive point charge $+q$ experiences a repulsive force directed radially outward.\n(b) The electric field lines are directed radially outward from the positive point charge $+q$.\ndirection. Figure 9.7 shows the electric field lines in the vicinity of a negative charge $-q$. In this case the lines are directed radially \"inward\", because the force on a positive test charge is now of attraction, indicating the electric field points inward.\nFigures 9.6 and 9.7 represent two dimensional pictures of the field lines. However, electric field lines emerge from the charges in three dimensions, and an infinite number of lines could be drawn.\nThe electric field lines \"map\" also provides information about the strength of the electric field. As we notice in Figs. 9.6 and 9.7 that field lines are closer to each other near the charges where the field is strong while they continuously spread out indicating a continuous decrease in the field strength.\n\nThe number of lines per unit area passing perpendicularly through it is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field.\nThe electric field lines are curved in case of two identical separated charges. Figure 9.8 shows the pattern of lines associated with two identical positive point charges of\nFig 9.7: The electric field lines are directed radially inward towards a negative point charge $-q$.\nFig.9.8: The electric field lines for two identical opposite point charges.\n\nequal magnitude. It reveals that the lines in the region between two like charges seem to repel each other. The behaviour of two identical negatively charges will be exactly the same. The middle region shows the presence of a zero field spot or neutral zone.\nFigure 9.9 shows the electric field pattern of two opposite charges of equal magnitudes. The field lines start from positive charge and end on a negative charge. The electric field at points such as $1,2,3$ is the resultant of fields created by the two charges at these points. The directions of the resultant intensities is given by the tangents drawn to the field lines at these points.\nIn the regions where the field lines are parallel and equally spaced, the same number of lines pass per unit area and therefore, field is uniform on all points. Figure 9.10 shows the field lines between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor. The field is uniform in the middle region where field lines are equally spaced.\nWe are now in a position to summarize the properties of electric field lines.\n\n1. Electric field lines originate from positive charges and end on negative charges.\n2. The tangent to a field line at any point gives the direction of the electric field at that point.\n3. The lines are closer where the field is strong and the lines are farther apart where the field is weak.\n4. No two lines cross each other. This is because E hes only one direction at any given point. If the lines cross E could have more than one direction.\n\n### 9.3 ELECTRIC FLUX\n\nWhen we place an element of area in an electric field, some of the lines of force pass through it (Fig. 9.11). The number of the field lines passing through a certain element of area is known as electric flux through that area. It is usually denoted by Greek letter $\\phi_{0}$. For example, the electric flux $\\phi_{0}$ through the area $A$ is 4 while the flux through B is 2 .\nIn order to give a quantitative meaning to flux, the field\nFig 9.9: The electric field lines are directed radially in ward towards a negative point charge -c.\nFig 9.10: In the central region of a parallel plate capacitor, the electric field lines are parallel and evenly spaced, indicating that the electric field there has the same magnitude and direction at points.\n\nDo you know?\nThere is no electric field inside the conductor.\nFig.9.11: Electric flux through a surface normal to E.\n\nlines are drawn such that the number of field lines passing through a unit area held perpendicular to field lines at a point represent the intensity $E$ of the field at that point.\nUsually, the element of area is represented by a vector area $A$ whose magnitude is equal to the surface area $A$ of the element and direction is along normal to the area.\nIn Fig.9.12 (a), area $A$ is held perpendicular to the field lines, then EA lines pass through it. The flux $\\phi_{n}$ in this case is:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{n}=E A\n$$\n\nIn Figure 9.12 (b), area $A$ is held parallel to field lines and, as is obvious no lines cross this area, so that flux $\\phi_{n}$ in this case is:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{n}=E A=0\n$$\n\nFigure 9.12(c) shows the case when $A$ is neither perpendicular nor parallel to field lines but is inclined at an angle $\\theta$ with the field $E$. In this case, we have to find the projection of the area which is perpendicular to the field lines. The area of this projection (Fig. 9.12-c) is $A \\cos \\theta$. The flux $\\phi_{n}$ in this case is:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{n}=E A \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\nThe electric flux $\\phi_{n}$ through a patch of flat surface in terms of $E$ and $A$ is then given by\n\n$$\n\\phi_{n}=E A \\cos \\theta=E \\cdot A\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the field lines and the normal to the area. Electric flux being a scalar product, is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit is $\\mathrm{Nm}^{2} \\mathrm{C}^{4}$.\n\n# Electric Flux Through a Surface Enclosing a Charge\n\nLet us calculate the electric flux through a closed surface, in shape of a sphere of radius $r$ due to a point charge $q$ placed at the centre of sphere as shown in Fig. 9.13. To apply the formula $\\phi_{n}=E . A$ for the computation of eleotric flux, the surface area should be flat. For this reason the total surface area of the\nFig.9.12(a): Maximum\nFig.9.12(b): Minimum\nFig.9.13: The total electric flux through the surface of the sphere due to a charge $q$ at its centre is $q \\delta_{0}$.\n\nsphere is divided into $n$ small patches with areas of magnitudes $\\Delta A_{1}, \\Delta A_{2}, \\Delta A_{3}, \\ldots \\ldots$ $\\Delta A_{n}$, respectively as shown in Fig. 9.13. The direction of each vector area is along perpendicular drawn outward to the corresponding patch. The electric intensities at the centres of vector areas $\\Delta A_{1}, \\Delta A_{2}, \\Delta A_{3}, \\ldots \\ldots, \\Delta A_{n}$ are $E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}, \\ldots \\ldots, E_{n}$ respectively.\nAccording to Eq. 9.13, the total flux passing through the closed surface is:\n\n$$\nQ_{n}=E_{1} \\cdot \\Delta A_{1}+E_{2} \\cdot \\Delta A_{2}+E_{3} \\cdot \\Delta A_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots \\ldots+E_{n} \\cdot \\Delta A_{n}\n$$\n\nThe direction of electric intensity and vector area is the same at each patch. Moreover,\n\n$$\n\\left|E_{1}\\right|=\\left|E_{2}\\right|=\\left|E_{3}\\right|=\\ldots \\ldots \\ldots=\\left|E_{n}=E=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{n}} \\frac{q}{r^{2}}\\right.\n$$\n\nSince $E$ is parallel to vector area $A_{1}$ therefore, $\\theta=0^{\\circ}$ (Fig. 9.13) so for each $E . \\Delta A=E A \\cos 0$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =E A \\cos 0^{\\circ}=E A \\quad\\left(\\because \\cos 0^{\\circ}=1\\right) \\\\\n& \\phi_{0}-E \\Delta A_{1}+E \\Delta A_{2}+E \\Delta A_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots \\ldots+E \\Delta A_{n} \\\\\n& -E\\left(\\Delta A_{1}+\\Delta A_{2}+\\Delta A_{3}-\\ldots \\ldots+\\Delta A_{n}\\right) \\\\\n& -E \\text { (Total spherical surface area) } \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{n}} \\frac{q}{r^{2}} \\times 4 \\pi r^{2} \\\\\n& \\phi_{0}=\\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_{n}} \\\\\n& \\text { (9.16) }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow Imagine that a closed surface $S$ is enclosing this sphere. It can be seen in Fig 9.14 that the flux through\nFig: 9.14\nthe closed surface $S$ is the same as that through the sphere. So, we can conclude that total flux through a closed surface does not depend upon the shape or geometry of the closed surface. It depends upon the medium and the charge enclosed.\n\n# 9.4 GAUSS'S LAW\n\nSuppose point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, \\ldots \\ldots, q_{n}$ are arbitrarily distributed within an arbitrarily shaped closed surface, as shown in Fig. 9.15. Since $\\phi_{n}=q / \\varepsilon_{n}$, so the electric flux passing through the closed surface is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\phi_{0}=\\frac{q_{1}}{\\varepsilon_{n}}\\left|\\frac{q_{2}}{\\varepsilon_{n}}\\right| \\frac{q_{3}}{\\varepsilon_{n}} \\mid \\ldots \\ldots \\cdot \\frac{q_{n}}{\\varepsilon_{n}} \\\\\n& \\phi_{n}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{n}} \\times\\left(q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots \\ldots+q_{n}\\right) \\\\\n& \\phi_{n}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{n}} \\times \\text { (Total charge enclosed by closed surface) } \\\\\n& \\phi_{n}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{n}} \\times Q\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFig: 9.15\n\n$$\n\\phi_{n}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{n}} \\times Q\n$$\n\nwhere $Q=q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots \\ldots+q_{n}$ is the total charge enclosed by closed surface. Equation 9.17 is mathematical expression of Gauss's law which can be slated as:\n\nThe total electric flux through any closed surface is $1 / k_{0}$ times the total charge enclosed in it.\n\n# Applications of Gauss's Law\n\nGauss's law can be applied to calculate the electric intensity due to different charge configurations. In all such cases, an imaginary closed surface is considered which passes through the point at which the electric intensity is to be evaluated. This closed surface is known as Gaussian surface. Its choice is such that the flux through it can be easily evaluated.\nAs an example, let us find the electric field at any point outside a sphere on which a charge $q$ is placed.\n\n## The Field of a Charged Conducting Sphere\n\nConsider a conducting sphere of radius $R$ containing a charge $q$. We know that all the charge is distributed uniformly over the surface of sphere as shown in Fig. 9.16. We can also conclude from the spherical symmetry that the electric field is radial everywhere and that its magnitude depends only on the distance $r$ from the centre of the sphere. Thus, the magnitude $E$ is uniform over a spherical surface with any radius $r$ concentric with the spherical conductor. Therefore, we take our Gaussian surface as an imaginary sphere with radius $r$ greater than the radius $R$ of the conducting sphere.\nThe area of the Gaussian sphere is $4 \\pi r^{2}$, and because $E$ is uniform over the sphere, the total flux through the whole surface will be:\nElectric flux\n\n$$\n\\phi_{2}=E A=E \\times 4 \\pi r^{2}\n$$\n\nBy Gauss's law, total flux is:\n\nTherefore\n\n$$\nE \\times 4 \\pi r^{2}=\\frac{q}{E}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{q}{E_{1}} \\frac{1}{4 \\pi r^{2}}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi E_{1}} \\times \\frac{q}{r^{2}}\n$$\n\nFig: 9.16\n\nThis shows that the field at any point outside the sphere is the same as though the entire charge were concentrated at its centre. Just outside of the sphere, where $r=R$, i.e.,\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi E_{1}} \\frac{q}{R^{2}}\n$$\n\nIn vector form;\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi E_{1}} \\frac{q}{R^{2}} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is the direction of $\\mathbf{E}$.\n\n# 9.5 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL\n\nFigure 9.17 shows two oppositely charged parallel plated which produce a uniform electric field.\nLet us consider a positive charge $q$ which is allowed to move in this uniform electric field. The positive charge will move from plate $B$ to $A$ and will gain $K . E$. If it is to be moved from $A$ to $B$, an external force is needed to make the charge move against the electric field and will gain P.E. Let us impose a condition that as the charge is moved from $A$ to $B$, it is moved keeping electrostatic equilibrium, i.e., it moves with uniform velocity. This\nFig 9.17\ncondition could be achieved by applying a force $F$ equal and opposite to $q E$ at every point along its path. The work done by the external force against the electric field increases electrical potential energy of the charge that is moved.\nLet $W_{\\text {Aa }}$ be the work done by the force in carrying the positive charge $q$ from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium. The change in its potential energy $\\Delta U=W_{\\text {Aa }}$.\nor $\\quad U_{0}-U_{A}=W_{A B}$\nwhere $U_{A}$ and $U_{0}$, are defined to be the potential energies at points $A$ and $B$, respectively.\nTo describe electric field, we introduce the idea of electric potential difference. The potential difference between two points $A$ and $B$ in an electric field is defined as the work done in carrying a unit positive charge from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\Delta V=V_{B}-V_{A}=\\frac{W_{A B}}{q}=\\frac{\\Delta U}{q}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ are defined as electric potentials at points $A$ and $B$ respectively. Electric potential energy difference and electric potential difference between the points $A$ and $B$ are related as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta U=q \\Delta V\n$$\n\nThus, the potential difference between the two points can be defined as the difference of the potential energy per unit charge.\nAn ECG records the \"voltage\" between points on human skin generated by electrical process in the heart. This ECG is made in running position providing information about the heart's performance under stress.\n\nAs the unit of P.E. is joule, Eq. 9.20 shows that the unit of potential difference is joule per coulomb. It is called volt such that,\n\n$$\n1 \\text { volt }=\\frac{1 \\text { joule }}{1 \\text { coulomb }}\n$$\n\nThat is, a potential difference of 1 volt exists between two points if work done in moving a 1 coulomb positive charge from one point to the other, keeping electrostatic equilibrium, is one joule.\nIn order to give a concept of electric potential at a point in an electric field, we must have a reference to which we assign zero electric potential. This point is usually taken at infinity. Thus, in Eq. 9.20, if we take point $A$ to be at infinity and choose $V_{0}=0$, the electric potential at $B$ will be $V_{0}=\\frac{W_{0}}{q}$. Generally,\n\n$$\nV=\\frac{W}{q}\n$$\n\nWhy is it advised to wear rubber soled shoes while handing electricappliances?\nwhich states that the electric potential at any point in an electric field is equal to the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point keeping it in electrostatic equilibrium. So, the potential at a point is always relative to potential at infinity. Both potential and potential differences are scalar quantities because both $W$ and $q$ are scalars.\n\n# Electric Field as Potential Gradient\n\nIn this section, we will establish a relation between electric intensity and potential difference. Let us consider the situation shown in Fig. 9.17. The electric field between the two charged plates is uniform and its value is $E$. The potential difference between $A$ and $B$ is given by the equation:\n\n$$\nV_{A}-V_{A}=\\frac{W_{A B}}{q}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{A B}=F d=-q E d$ (the negative sign is needed because $F$ must be applied opposite to $q E$ so as to keep it in equilibrium). With this, Eq. 9.24 becomes:\n\n$$\nV_{A}-V_{A}=\\frac{-q E d}{q}=-E d\n$$\n\nor $E=\\frac{\\left(V_{A}-V_{A}\\right)}{d}=-\\frac{\\Delta V}{d}$\nIf the plates $A$ and $B$ are separated by infinitesimally small distance $\\Delta d$, the Eq. 9.25 is modified as:\n\n$$\nE=-\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta d}\n$$\n\nThe quantity $\\Delta V / \\Delta d$ gives the maximum value of the rate of change of potential with distance because the charge has been moved along a field line in which the\n\nECG (Normal alpha rhythm)\nTima\nECG (Abnormal)\n\nIn electrooncophalography the potential deference created by the electrical activity of the brain are used for diagnosing abnormalbehavior.\n\n# Physics II\n\ndistance $\\Delta d$ between the two plates is minimum. It is known as potential gradient. Thus, the electric field intensity is equal to the negative of the gradient of electric potential. The negative sign indicates that the direction of $E$ is along the decreasing potential.\nThe unit of electric intensity from Eq.9.26 is volt/metre $\\left(\\mathrm{V} \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\right)$ which is equal to $\\mathrm{N} \\mathrm{C}^{-1}$ as given below:\n\n$$\n1 \\frac{\\text { volt }}{\\text { metre }}=1 \\frac{\\text { joule/coulomb }}{\\text { metre }}=1 \\frac{\\text { newton } \\times \\text { metre }}{\\text { metre } \\times \\text { coulomb }}=1 \\frac{\\text { newton }}{\\text { coulomb }}=1 \\mathrm{NC}^{-1}\n$$\n\nExample 9.4 Two parallel metal plates are 1.0 cm apart.

A positive charge $+q$ placed in the field will move in the direction of electric field whereas a negative charge $-q$ will move opposite to the electric field. The magnitude of electric force acting on a charge qis represented in Fig 9.18 given by\n\n$$\nF=q E\n$$\n\nwhere $E$ is the electric intensity of the uniform electric field.

The path is typically straight if the field is uniform and the charged particle is moving along the field. However, if a charged particle enters perpendicularly to the uniform field between the oppositely charged parallel plates with a certain velocity as shown in Fig. 9.19, it will not go straight. Its path will be parabolic just like a projectile thrown horizontally in the gravitational field. The horizontal component of the velocity of the charged particle remains constant whereas vertical component is accelerated due to the electric force.\nFigure 9.19 shows that a positivity charged particle is attracted towards the negatively charged plate and thus undergoes deflection in that direction.\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFig. 9.19\n\nOn the other hand, a negatively charged particle is attracted towards the positively charged plate and experiences deflection in that direction.\n\n# 9.9 SHIELDING FROM EXTERNAL ELECTRIC FIELD\n\nAn English scientist Michael Faraday invented a structure in 1836, called Faraday cage or Faraday shield. Faraday cage is an enclosure that blocks the external electric fields in conductive materials. It acts like a hollow conductor where devices or objects can be put for protection from electrical external fields. Any electrical shock received by the cage runs through its outer surface without causing any harm inside. The electric field inside the hollow conductor remains zero.\nTo understand the working of Faraday cage, suppose that a piece of conductor (say copper) carries a number of free electrons. Each electron will experience a force of repulsion because of the electric field of its neighbouring electrons. As a consequence, all the electrons rush to the surface of the conductor. Once static equilibrium is established with all of the excess charges on the surface, no further movement of charge occurs. If some electrons shift from the conductor to another object due to friction etc., a net positive charge appears on the surface of the conductor. We can say,\n\nAt equilibrium under electrostatic conditions, any\nexcess charge resides on the surface of a conductor.\nNow consider the interior of the hollow conductor. The excess charges arrange themselves on the conductor's surface precisely in the manner that the total field within the interior becomes zero. In other words,\nThe conductor shields any charge within it from electric fields outside the conductor.\nTo eliminate the interference of external fields, circuits are often enclosed within metal boxes that provide shielding from such fields.\nFigure 9.20 shows another aspect of how conductors alter the electric field lines created by external charges.\nFig. 9.20\n\nThe lines are altered because the electric field just outside the surface of a conductor is perpendicular to the surface at equilibrium under electrostatic conditions. If the field were not perpendicular, there would be a component of the field parallel to the surface. Since the free electrons on the surface of the conductor can move, they would do so under the force exerted by the parallel component. But in reality, no electron flow occurs at equilibrium. Therefore, there can be no parallel component, and the electric field is perpendicular to the surface.\nThe principle of Faraday cage demands a material that contains a lot of free electrons that can move freely to the surface of the material. Only the conductors have free\n\nelectrons whereas insulators do not contain free electron, so the insulators can not be used to construct Faraday cage.\nA good example of Faraday cage in our daily life is that of cars. The chassis and bodies of cars protect people inside due to its metal framed structure during the thunderstorms. The electrical charge travels over the metal surface of the vehicle into the ground and prevent the passengers inside.\nA metal body of the microwave oven acts as a Faraday cage. Thus, they prevent the microwaves in an oven from expanding into the environment. Metal frame of an airplane also acts as a Faraday cage. When lightning strikes an airplane, electricity is distributed along its metal frame surface that keeps passengers and all devices inside the airplane safe.\n\n# 9.10 ELECTRIC CURRENT\n\nUsually, it is said that electric current is the flow of charge. Let us see what actually flows in a conductor. The charge carriers are the free electrons. When the ends of a conductor are connected to a battery or some other source of potential, an electric field is set up at every point within the conductor. The free electrons experience a force in the direction of -E and they start moving. As the free electrons are bumping among the atoms, so they are not accelerated in a straight line under this force. They keep on colliding with the atoms of the conductor. The overall effect of these collisions is to transfer the energy of accelerated eletrons to the lattice with the result that the electrons acquire an average velocity, called the drift velocity in the direction of -E . The drift velocity is of the order of $10^{-4} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This drift velocity of electrons forms the electric current. The slow drift velocity does not mean that it takes long time for an electric current to set up. We know that as soon as we switch ON a bulb, itlitup immediately.\nThe reason is that on turning the switch ON, all the free electrons in the circuit start drifting. They repel the neighbouring ones and the disturbance propagates along the wire almost instantaneously. That is why, the electric current is set up very rapidly.\nIf a net charge $Q$ passes through any cross-section of a conductor in time $t$, the current $I$ flowing through it is:\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{Q}{T}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of current is ampere (A) and it is the current due to flow of one coulomb charge per second through any cross-section of a conductor. If the charges move around a circuit in the same direction at all times, the current is said to be direct current (D.C). For example, batteries produce direct current. If the charges move first one way and then the opposite way, changing direction in regular intervals, the current is said to be alternating current (A.C). Mostly the electric generators produce A.C. The electricity supplied to our homes, offices, factories etc., by power stations is an A.C.\n\n## Conventional Current\n\nAs we now understand, the electric current is due to flow of electrons through the metal\n\nwires, but early scientists believed that electric current was due to flow of positive charges. The scientists have kept the convention and take the direction of current flow to be the direction in which positive charges would move. We call it conventional current.\n\nConventional current is hypothetical flow of positive charges that would have the same effect in the circuit as the flow of negative charges that actually does occur.\n\nIn Fig. 9.21, negative electrons arrive at the positive terminal of the battery. The same effect would have been achieved if an equivalent amount of positive charge has left the positive terminal. Therefore, we can say that the conventional current flows from positive terminal towards the negative terminal of a battery. A conventional current is consistent with our earlier use of a positive test charge for\ndefining electric fields and potential. The direction of conventional current is always from a point of higher potential towards a point of lower potential that is from the positive terminal towards the negative terminal. Now onward the current / always means the conventional current.\n\n# 9.11 CURRENT THROUGH A CONDUCTOR\n\nConsider a segment of the current carrying conductor having length $L$ and area of crosssection $A$. The volume of the segment is $A L$, as represented in Fig. 9.22. Let $n$ be the number of charge carriers per unit volume, then total number of charge carriers in the segment at any time are $n A L$. If the charge on a charge carrier is $q$, the total change present\nFig. 9.22: Negative charge carriers\ninside the segment at any instant is:\n\n$$\nQ=n A L q\n$$\n\nUsually, the charge carriers in a conductor are free electrons which have negative charge.\nSuppose that charge carriers move towards left face of the segment when a potential difference is applied across the conductor. Then electric current is set up in the conductor directed towards right face. Assuming that drift velocity of the charge carries to be $v$, the time taken $t$ by all the charge carriers originally present in the\n\n## Flow of current is directly proportional to the potential difference.\nFlow of heat is directly proportional to the temperature difference.\nFlow of fluid is directly proportional to the pressure difference.\n\n## For your information?\n\nCurrent is a flow of charge, pressured into motion by voltage and hampered by resistance.\n\nsegment to exit through the left face will be:\nBy definition of the current\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& t=\\frac{L}{v} \\\\\n& i=\\frac{Q}{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nPutting the value of $Q$ and $t$ in the above equation, we have\n\n$$\ni=\\frac{n A L q}{L_{v}}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nI=n A v q\n$$\n\n(1) Example 9.7 A copper wire has a cross-sectional area of $2 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and carries a current of 3 A .

The Ohm'slaw states that:\n\nThe current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference applied across the conductor, provided there is no charge in the physical state of the conductor.\nMathematically,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n& I \\propto V & \\text { or } \\quad V \\propto I \\\\\n\\text { or } & V=I R & (9.34)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere $R$ is a constant of proportionality known as resistance of the conductor. The SI unit of resistance is ohm denoted by the Greek capital letter omega ( $\\Omega$ ), and is defined as:\n\nThe resistance of a conductor is 1 ohm if a current of 1 ampere flows through it when a potential difference of 1 volt is applied across its ends.\n\n### 9.13 RESISTIVITY AND ITS DEPENDENCE UPON TEMPERATURE\n\nIt has been experimentally seen that the resistance $R$ of a wire is directly proportional to\n\nits length $L$ and inversely proportional to its cross sectional area $A$. Mathematically,\n\n$$\nR \\propto \\frac{L}{A}\n$$\n\n$$\nR=\\rho \\frac{L}{A}\n$$\n\nwhere $p$ (rho) is a constant of proportionality known as resistivity or specific resistance of the material of the wire. It may be noted that resistance is the characteristic of a particular wire whereas the resistivity is the property of the material of which the wire is made. From Eq. 9.35, we have\n\n$$\n\\rho=\\frac{R A}{L}\n$$\n\nThe above equation gives the definition of resistivity as the resistance of a metre cube of a material. The SI unit of resistivity is ohm-metre ( $\\Omega \\mathrm{m}$ )\nConductance is another quantity used to describe the electrical properties of materials. In fact, conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\text { Conductance }=\\frac{1}{\\text { Resistance }}, G=\\frac{1}{R}, G \\text { is the conductance. }\n$$\n\nMathematically, conductivity, $\\sigma$ (sigma) is the reciprocal of resistivity ( $\\rho$ ), i.e.\n\n$$\n\\sigma=\\frac{1}{\\rho}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of conductivity is ohm \" $m$ \" or mho m\". Resistivity of various materials is given in Table 9.2. It may be noted from Table 9.2 that silver and copper are two best conductors. That is the reason, most of electric wires are made of copper.\nThe resistivity of a substance depends upon the temperature also. It can be explained by recalling that the resistance offered by a conductor to the flow of electric current is due to collisions, which the free electrons encounter with atoms of the lattice. As the temperature of the conductor rises, the amplitude of vibration of the atoms in the lattice increases and hence, the probability of their collision with free electrons also increases. One may say that the atoms then offer a bigger target, that is the collision cross-section of the atoms increases with temperature. This makes the collisions between free electrons and the atoms in the lattice more frequent and hence, the resistance of the conductor increases.\n\n| Table 9.2 |  |  |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Substance | $\\rho(\\Omega \\mathrm{m})$ | $\\sigma\\left(\\mathrm{K}^{-1}\\right)$ |\n| Silver | $1.52 \\times 10^{-6}$ | 0.00380 |\n| Copper | $1.59 \\times 10^{-6}$ | 0.00390 |\n| Gold | $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ | 0.00340 |\n| Aluminum | $2.63 \\times 10^{-6}$ | 0.00390 |\n| Tungsten | $5.00 \\times 10^{-6}$ | 0.00460 |\n| Iron | $11.00 \\times 10^{-6}$ | 0.00520 |\n| Platinum | $11.00 \\times 10^{-6}$ | 0.00520 |\n| Constanton | $49.00 \\times 10^{-6}$ | 0.00001 |\n| Mercury | $94.00 \\times 10^{-6}$ | 0.00091 |\n| Nichrome | $100.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ | 0.00020 |\n| Carbon | $3.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ | -0.00005 |\n| Germanium | 0.5 | -0.05 |\n| Silicon | $20-2300$ | -0.07 |\n\n# Physica II\n\nExperimentally, the change in resistance of a metallic conductor with temperature is found to be nearly linear over a considerable range of temperature above and below $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (Fig.9.23). Over such a range the fractional change in resistance per kelvin is known as the temperature coefficient ( $\\alpha$ ) of resistance, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{R_{i}-R_{0}}{R_{0} t}\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{0}$ and $R_{i}$ are resistances at temperatures $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $t^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ respectively.

Values of temperature coefficients of resistance of some substances are also listed in Table 9.2. There are some substances like germanium, silicon, etc. whose resistance decreases with increase in temperature, these substances have negative temperature coefficients.\nFig. 9.23: Variation of resistivity of Cu with temperature\n\n## Inspectors can easily check the reliability of a concrete bridge made with carbon fibers.

A steady current flows through the circuit and a steady potential difference $V$ exists between the terminals $A$ and $B$ of the resistor $R$. Terminal $A$, connected to the positive pole of the battery, is at a higher potential than the terminal B. In this circuit the battery is continuously lifting charge uphill through the potential difference $V$. Using the meaning of potential difference, the work done in moving a charge $Q$ up through the potential difference $V$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\text { Work done }=W=V \\times Q \\text {. } \\\\\n\\text { This is the energy supplied by the battery. }\n$$\n\nThe rate at which the battery is supplying electrical energy is the power output or electrical power of the battery. Using the definition of power, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Electrical power } & =\\frac{\\text { Energy supplied }}{\\text { Time taken }}=V \\frac{Q}{t} \\\\\n\\text { Since } \\quad I & =\\frac{Q}{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe above equation can also be written as:\nFig. 9.24: The power of a battery appears as the power dissipated in the resistance $R$.\n\nElectrical power $=V I$\nEquation 9.42 is a general relation for power delivered from a source of current $I$ operating on a voltage $V$. In the circuit shown in Fig. 9.24 the power supplied by the battery is expended or dissipated in the resistor $R$. The principle of conservation of energy tells us that the power dissipated in the resistor is also given by Eq. 9.42.\n\nPower dissipated $P=V I$\nAlternative equation for calculating power can be found by substituting $V=I R, I=V / R$ in turn in Eq. 9.42.\nor\n\n$$\nP=V I=(I R) I=I^{2} R\n$$\n\n$$\nP=V I=V(V / R)=V^{2} / R\n$$\n\nThus, we have three equations for calculating the power dissipated in a resistor.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P=V I, \\quad P=I^{2} R \\\\\n& P=V^{2} / R\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf $V$ Is expressed in volts and $I$ in amperes, the power is expressed in watts.\n\n### 9.15 ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE (EMF) AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE\n\nWe know that a source of electrical energy, say a cell or a battery, when connected across a resistance, maintains a steady current through it Fig. 9.25. The cell\n\ncontinuously supplies energy which is dissipated in the resistance of the circuit. Suppose when a steady current has been established in the circuit, a charge $Q$ passes through any cross-section of the circuit in time $t$. During the course of motion, this charge enters the cell at its low potential end and leaves at its high potential end. The source must supply energy $W$ to the positive charge to compel it to go to the point of high potential. The emf $E$ of the source is defined as the energy supplied to unit charge by the cell.\ni.e.,\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{W}{Q}\n$$\n\nFig. 9.25: Electromotive force of a cell\n\nIt may be noted that electromotive force is not a force and we do not measure it in newtons. The unit of emf is joule/coulomb which is volt (V). The energy supplied by the cell to the charge carriers is derived from the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy inside the cell.\nLike other components in a circuit, a cell also offers some resistance. This resistance is due to the electrolyte present between the two electrodes of the cell and is called the internal resistance of the cell. Thus, a cell of emf $E$ having an internal resistance $r$ is equivalent to a source of pure emf $E$ with a resistance $r$ in series as shown in Fig. 9.26.\nLet us consider the performance of a cell of emf $E$ and internal resistance $r$ as shown in Fig.9.27. A voltmeter of infinite resistance measures the potential difference across the external resistance $R$ or the potential difference $V$ across the terminals of the cell. The current $I$ flowing through the circuit is given by\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{E}{R+r}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text { or } E=I R+I r \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots(9.45)\n$$\n\nHere $I R=V$ is the terminal potential difference of the cell in the presence of current $I$. When the switch $S$ is open, no current passes through the resistance. In this case, the voltmeter reads the emf $E$ as terminal voltage. Thus, terminal voltage in the presence of the current (switch ON) would be less than the emf Eby Ir.\nA voltmeter connected across the terminals of a cell measures: (a) the emf of the cell on open circuit,\n(b) the tarminal potential difference on a closed circuit.\n\nLet us interpret the Eq. 9.45 on energy considerations. The left side of this equation is the emf $E$ of the cell which is equal to energy gained by unit charge as it passes through the cell from its negative to positive terminal. The right side of the equation gives an account of the utilization of this energy as the current passes the circuit. It states that, as a unit charge passes through the circuit, a part of this energy equal to irle dissipated into the cell and the rest of the energy is dissipated into the external resistance $R$. It is given by potential drop $I R$. Thus, the emf gives the energy supplied to unit charge by the cell and the potential drop across the various elements account for the dissipation of this energy into other forms as the unit charge passes through these elements.\nThe emf is the \"cause\" and potential difference is its \"effect\". The emf is always present even when no current is drawn through the battery or the cell, but the potential difference across the conductor is zero when no current flows through it.\nExample 9.10 The potential difference between the terminals of a battery in open circuit is 2.2 V . When it is connected across a resistance of $5.0 \\Omega$, the potential falls to 1.8 V . Calculate the current and the internal resistance of the battery.\n\nSolution\n\n$$\nE=2.2 \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad R=5.0 \\Omega, \\quad V=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nWe have to calculate $I$ and $r$\nUsing\n\n$$\nV=I R \\quad \\text { or } \\quad I=\\frac{V}{R}=\\frac{1.8 \\mathrm{~V}}{5.0 \\Omega}=0.36 \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\nInternal resistance $r$ can be calculated by using\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nE & =V+i r \\\\\n2.2 V & =1.8 \\mathrm{~V}+0.36 \\mathrm{Ax} r\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n$r=1.1 \\Omega$\n\n# 9.16 KIRCHHOFF'S RULES\n\nKirchhoff's rules are two fundamental principles in circuit analysis that help to determine the current and voltage in electrical circuits. They are particularly useful for analysing complex circuits that cannot be simplified by Ohm's law and series or parallel combinations.\n\n## Kirchhoff's First Rule\n\nIt states that the sum of all the currents meeting at a point in the circuit is zero.\ni.e., $\\quad 27=0$\nIt is a convention that a current flowing towards a point is taken as positive and that flowing away from a point is taken as negative.\n\nFor your information\nA node is a point in an electric circuit which joins the two or more branches.\n\nConsider a situation where four wires meet at a point $A$ (Fig.9.28). The currents flowing into the point $A$ sre $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ and currents flowing away from the point are $I_{3}$ and $I_{4}$.\nAccording to the convention, currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are positive and currents $I_{3}$ and $I_{4}$ are negative. Applying Eq. 9.48 , we have\n\n$$\nI_{1}+I_{2}+\\left(-I_{3}\\right)+\\left(-I_{4}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nI_{1}+I_{2}=I_{3}+I_{4}\n$$\n\nUsing Eq.9.47, Kirchhoff's first rule can be stated in other words as:\n\nThe sum of all the currents flowing towards a point is equal to the sum of all the currents flowing away from the point.\nFig. 9.28: According to Kirchhoff's $1^{\\text {st }}$ rule $I_{1}+I_{2}=I_{3}+I_{4}$\n\n## Deved know?\n\nThe node at which potential is taken as zero is called datum node or reference node.\n\nKirchhoff's first rule which is also known as Kirchhoff's point rule is a manifestation of law of conservation of charge. If there is no sink or source of charge at a point, the total charge flowing towards the point must be equal to the total charge flowing away from it.\n\n# Kirchhoff's Second Rule\n\nIt states that the algebraic sum of voltage changes in a closed circuit or a loop must be equal to zero. Consider a closed circuit shown in Fig. 9.29. The direction of the current / flowing through the circuit depends on the cell having the greater emf. Suppose $E_{1}$ is greater than $E_{2}$, so the current flows in counter clockwise direction. We know that a steady current is equivalent to a continuous flow of positive charges through the circuit. We also know that a voltage change or potential difference is equal to the work done on a unit positive charge or energy gained or lost by it in moving from one point to the other. Thus, when a positive charge $Q$ due to the current $I$ in the closed circuit (Fig.9.29), passes through the cell $E_{1}$ from low (-ve) to high potential ( +ve ), it gains energy because work is done on it. Using Eq. 9.44 the energy gain is $E_{1} Q$. When the current passes through the cell $E_{2}$, it loses energy equal to $-E_{2} Q$ because here the charge passes from high to low potential. In going through the resistor $R_{1}$, the charge $Q$ loses energy equal to $-I R_{1} Q$ where $I R_{1}$ is potential difference across $R_{1}$. The minus sign shows that the charge is passing from high to low potential. Similarly, the loss of energy while passing through the resistor $R_{2}$ is $-I R_{2} Q$. Finally, the charge reaches the negative terminal of the cell $E_{2}$ from where we started. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total change in energy of our system is zero. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$\nE_{1} Q-I R_{1} Q-E_{2} Q-I R_{2} Q=0\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nE_{1}-I R_{1}-E_{2}-I R_{2}=0\n$$\n\nFig. 9.29: According to Kirchhoff's $2^{\\text {nd }}$ rule $E_{1}-I R_{1}-E_{2}-I R_{2}=0$\n\nwhich is Kirchhoff's second rule and it states that:\nThe algebraic sum of potential changes in a closed circuit is zero.\nWe have seen that this rule is simply a particular way of stating the law of conservation of energy in electrical problems.\nBefore applying this rule for the analysis of complex network, it is worthwhile to thoroughly understand the rules for finding the potential changes.\n(i) If a source of emf is traversed from positive to negative terminal, the potential change is positive. It is negative in the opposite direction.\n(ii) If a resistor is traversed in the direction of current, the change in potential is positive. It is negative in the opposite direction.\nExample 9.11 Calculate the currents in the three resistances of the circuit shown in Fig. 9.30.\n\n# Solution\n\nFirst we select two loops abcda and ebcfe. The choice of loops is quite arbitrary, but it should be such that each resistance is included at least once in the selected loops.\nFig. 9.30\n\nAfter selecting the loops, suppose a current $I_{1}$ is flowing in the first loop and $I_{2}$ in the second loop, all flowing in the same sense. These currents are called loop currents. The actual currents will be calculated with their help. It should be noted that the sense of the current flowing in all loops should essentially be the same. It may be clockwise or anticlockwise. Here we have assumed it to be clockwise.\nWe now apply Kirchhoff's second rule to obtain the equations required to calculate the currents through the resistances. We first consider the loop abcda. Starting at point a we follow the loop clockwise. The voltage change while crossing the battery $E_{1}$ is $-E_{1}$ because the current flows through it from positive to negative. The voltage change across $R_{1}$ is $-I_{1} R_{1}$. The resistance $R_{2}$ is common to both the loops $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$, therefore, the currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ simultaneously flow through it. The directions of currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ as flowing through $R_{2}$ are opposite, so we have to decide that which of these currents is to be assigned a positive sign. The convention regarding the sign of the current is that if we are applying the Kirchhoff's second rule in the first loop, then the current of this loop i.e., $I_{1}$ will be assigned a positive sign and all currents flowing opposite to $I_{1}$ have a negative sign. Similarly, while applying Kirchhoff's second rule in the second loop, the current $I_{2}$ will be considered as positive and $I_{1}$ as negative. Using this convention the current\n\nflowing through $R_{2}$ is $\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right)$ and the voltage change across is $-\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right) R_{2}$. The voltage change across the battery $E_{2}$ is $E_{2}$. Thus, the Kirchhoff's second rule as applied to the loop abode gives\n\n$$\n-E_{1}-I_{1} R_{1}-\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right) R_{2}+E_{2}=0\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n-40 \\mathrm{~V}-I_{1} \\times 10 \\Omega-\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right) \\times 30 \\Omega+60 \\mathrm{~V}=0 \\\\\n20 \\mathrm{~V}-10 \\Omega \\times\\left[I_{1}+3\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right)\\right]=0 \\\\\n4 I_{1}-3 I_{2}=2 \\mathrm{~V} \\Omega^{1}=2 \\mathrm{~A} \\\\\n4 I_{1}-3 I_{2}=2 \\mathrm{~V} \\Omega^{1}=2 \\mathrm{~A}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, applying Kirchhoff's second rule to the loop ebote, we have\n\n$$\n-E_{2}-\\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\\right) R_{2}-I_{2} R_{2}+E_{2}=0\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n-60 \\mathrm{~V}-\\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\\right) \\times 30 \\Omega-I_{2} \\times 15 \\Omega+50 \\mathrm{~V}=0 \\\\\n-10 \\mathrm{~V}-15 \\Omega \\times\\left[I_{2}+2\\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\\right)\\right]=0 \\\\\n6 I_{1}-9 I_{2}=2 \\mathrm{~V} \\Omega^{1}=2 \\mathrm{~A}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nSolving Eq.(i) and Eq. (ii) for $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$, we have\n\n$$\nI_{1}=0.86 \\AA \\text { and } I_{2}=0.22 \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\nKnowing the value of loop currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ the actual current flowing through each resistance of the circuit can be determined. Fig. 9.29 shows that $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are the actual currents through the resistances $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. The actual current through $R_{2}$ is the difference of $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ and its direction is along the larger current. Thus,\nThe current through $R_{1}=I_{1}=2 / 3 A=0.66$ A flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from a to d.\nThe current through $R_{2}=I_{1}-I_{2}=2 / 3 A-2 / 9 A=0.44$ A flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from cto b.\nThe current through $R_{2}=I_{2}=2 / 9 A=0.22$ A flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from $f$ to e.\n\n# Procedures of Solution of Circuit Problems\n\nAfter solving the above problem, we are in a position to apply the same procedure to analyse other direct current complex networks. While using Kirchhoff's rules in other problems, it is worthwhile to follow the approach given below:\n(i) Draw the circuit diagram.\n(ii) The choice of loops should be such that each resistance is included at least once in the selected loops.\n(iii) Assume a loop current in each loop. All the loop currents should be in the same sense. It may be either clockwise or anticlockwise.\n(iv) Write the loop equations for all the selected loops. For writing each loop equation, the voltage change across any component is positive if traversed from low to high\n\npotential and it is negative if traversed from high to low potential.\n(v) Solve these equations for the unknown quantities.\n\n# 9.17 WHEATSTONE BRIDGE\n\nIt is an electric circuit. The Wheatstone bridge circuit shown in Fig. 9.31 consists of four resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ connected in such a way so as to form a mesh ABCDA. A battery is connected between points $A$ and $C$. A sensitive galvanometer of resistance $R_{2}$ is connected between points $B$ and $D$. If the switch $S$ is closed, a current will flow through the galvanometer. We have to determine the condition under which no current flows through the galvanometer even after the switch is closed. For this purpose, we analyse this circuit using Kirchhoff's second rule. We consider two loops ABDA and BCDB and assume anticlockwise loop currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ through the loops respectively. The Kirchhoff's second rule as applied to loop ABDA gives:\nFig. 9.31: Wheatstone bridge circuit\n\n$$\n-I_{1} R_{1}-\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right) R_{2}-I_{1} R_{3}=0\n$$\n\nSimilarly, by applying the Kirchhoff's second rule to loop BCDB, we have\n\n$$\n-I_{2} R_{2}-I_{1} R_{1}-\\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\\right) R_{2}=0\n$$\n\nThe current flowing through the galvanometer will be zero if, $I_{1}-I_{2}=0$ or $I_{1}=I_{2}$. With this condition Eq. 9.51 and Eq. 9.52 reduce to:\n\n$$\n-I_{2} R_{2}=I_{1} R_{3}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n-I_{3} R_{2}=I_{1} R_{4}\n$$\n\nDividing Eq. 9.48 by Eq. 9.49, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{-I_{1} R_{1}}{-I_{2} R_{2}}=\\frac{I_{1} R_{3}}{I_{2} R_{4}}\n$$\n\nAs $I_{1}=I_{2}$, therefore,\n\n$$\n\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{4}}\n$$\n\n## Point to ponder!\n\nWhy is a three pin plug used in some electric appliances?\n\nThus, whenever the condition of Eq. 9.54 is satisfied, no current flows through the galvanometer and it shows no deflection, or conversely when the galvanometer in the Wheatstone bridge circuit shows no deflection, Eq. 9.54 is satisfied. If we connect three\n\nresistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ of known adjustable values and a fourth resistance $R_{4}$ of unknown value and the resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ are so adjusted that the galvanometer shows no deflection, then from the known resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$, the unknown resistance $R_{4}$ can be determined by using Eq. 9.54.\n\n# 9.18 POTENTIOMETER\n\nA potentiometer is mainly used to compare potential differences and to find the value of an unknown resistance. It works on the principle of Wheatslone Bridge.\n\n## Working of Potentiometer\n\nPotential difference is usually measured by an instrument called a voltmeter. The voltmeter is connected across the two points in a circuit between which potential difference is to be measured. It is necessary that the resistance of the voltmeter be large compared to the circuit resistance across which the voltmeter is connected. Otherwise, an appreciable current will flow through the voltmeter which will alter the circuit current and the potential difference to be measured. Thus, the voltmeter can read the correct potential difference only when it does not draw any current from the circuit across which it is connected. An ideal voltmeter would have an infinite resistance.\nHowever, there are some potential measuring instruments such as digital voltmeter and cathode-ray oscilloscope which practically do not draw any current from the circuit because of their large resistance and are thus very accurate potential measuring instruments. But these instruments are very expensive. A very simple instrument which can measure and compare potential differences accurately is a potentiometer.\nA potentiometer consists of a resistor $R$ in the form of a wire on which a terminal $C$ can slide (Fig. 9.32-a). The resistance between $A$ and $C$ can be varied from 0 to $R$ as the sliding contact $C$ is moved from $A$ to $B$. If a battery of emf $E$ is connected across $R$ (Fig. 9.32-b) the current flowing through it is $I=E / R$. If we represent the resistance between $A$ and $C$ by $r$, the potential drop between these points will be $r I=r E / R$. Thus, as $C$ is moved from $A$ to $B, r$ varies from 0 to $R$ and the potential drop between $A$ and $C$ changes from 0 to $E$.\nSuch an arrangement also known as potential divider can be used to measure the unknown emf of a source by using the circuit shown in Fig. 9.33. Here $R$ is in the form of a straight wire of uniform area of cross-section. A source of potential, say a cell whose emf $E_{x}$ is to be\nFig. 9.32\n\nmeasured, is connected between $A$ and the sliding contact $C$ through a galvanometer $G$. It should be noted that the positive terminal of $E_{x}$ and that of the potential divider are connected to the same point $A$. If, in the loop AGCA, the point $C$ and the negative terminal of $E_{x}$ are at the same potential, then the two terminals of the galvanometer will be at the same potential and no current will flow through the galvanometer. Therefore, to measure the potential $E_{x}$, the position of $C$ is so adjusted that the galvanometer shows no deflection. Under this\nFig. 9.33\ncondition, the emf $E_{x}$, of the cell is equal to the potential difference between $A$ and $C$ whose value $E_{x} / R$ is known. In case of a wire of uniform cross-section, the resistance is proportional to the length of the wire. Therefore, the unknown emf is also given by\n\n$$\nE_{x}=E \\frac{\\ell}{R}=E \\frac{\\ell}{L}\n$$\n\nwhere $L$ is the total length of the wire $A B$ and $\\ell$ is its length from $A$ to $C$, after $C$ has been adjusted for no deflection. As the maximum potential that can be obtained between $A$ and $C$ is $E$, so the unknown emf $E_{x}$ should not exceed this value, otherwise the null condition will not be obtained. It can be seen that the unknown emf $E_{x}$ is determined when no current is drawn from it and therefore, potentiometer is one of the most accurate methods for measuring potential.\nThe method for measuring the emf of a cell as described above can be used to compare the emfs $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ of two cells. The balancing lengths $\\ell$, and $\\ell_{2}$ are found separately for the two cells. Then,\n\n$$\nE_{1}=E \\frac{\\ell_{1}}{L} \\text { and } E_{2}=E \\frac{\\ell_{2}}{L}\n$$\n\nDividing these two equations, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{1}}{E_{2}}=\\frac{\\ell}{\\ell_{2}}\n$$\n\nSo, the ratio of the emfs is equal to ratio of the balancing lengths.\n\n# 9.19 USE OF A GALVANOMETER\n\nA galvanometer is an instrument for detecting a current. We are not going to discuss its internal structure and how does it work. We focus only on its use. It is often used in null methods to achieve precise measurements in electrical circuits. The null method involves adjusting the circuit until the galvanometer shows no deflection i.e., a zero reading. This indicates that certain required conditions are met in the circuit. In this state, the electric potentials at both ends of the galvanometer are the same. Although a galvanometer has its own resistance, but at the null reading, its resistance does not\n\ncome into play. The reason is that, in this condition no current is passing through it. The null method is widely used in bridge circuits such as Wheatstone and potentiometer setups.\nAs we have studied in the previous section, the null method is used to measure an unknown resistance in the Wheatstone bridge circuits. The galvanometer is connected between the mid-points of opposite sides. The variable resistance is adjusted until the galvanometer shows no deflection. At this point, the bridge is balanced and the unknown resistance can be calculated using the ratio of the known resistances.\nIn a potentiometer, null method is used to measure an unknown voltage by comparison with a known reference voltage applied across the resistance wire of the potentiometer. A galvanometer and a jockey are used to make contact along the wire. At null point, the potential difference between the jockey and the end of the wire equals the unknown voltage. The position of the jockey gives the measure of the unknown voltage.\nThere are some advantages of using a galvanometer in null method.\n\n1. Null method, eliminates the effect of the galvanometer's internal resistance on the measurement resulting in more accurate readings.\n2. Galvanometers are highly sensitive and can detect very small currents of the order of $10^{4}$ ampere.\n3. \"No deflection\" indicates a direct and clear condition of balance making it easier to identify the null point.\n\n# 9.20 THERMISTORS\n\nA thermistor is a heat sensitive resistor. Most thermistors have negative temperature coefficient of resistance, i.e., the resistance of such thermistors decreases when their temperature is increased. Thermistors with positive temperature coefficient are also available.\nIn the thermistors, resistance decreases as temperature increases. This is because increasing temperature provides more energy to the charge carriers (electrons or holes), enabling them to move more freely and thus reducing resistance.\nThermistors are made by heating under high pressure semiconductor ceramic made from mixtures of metallic oxides of manganese, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron, etc. These are pressed into desired shapes and\nFig. 9.34: Thermistors syambols\nFig. 9.35: Types of thermistors\n\nthen baked at high temperature. Different types of thermistors are shown in Fig. 9.34. They may be in the form of beads, rods or washers.\n\n# Applications of Thermistors\n\n## Temperature Measurement\n\nThermistors are used in thermometers, and electric devices such as air conditioners, refrigerators, heaters, microwave ovens, incubators, etc.to monitor temperature.\nThermistors with high negative temperature coefficient are very accurate for measuring low temperatures especially near 10 K . The higher resistance at low temperature enables more accurate measurement possible.\nThermistors have wide applications as temperature sensors, i.e. they convert changes of temperature into electrical voltage which is duly processed. For example, these are used in coolant temperature sensors in automobile engines to prevent the engine overheating and in digital thermometers.\n\n## Temperature Compensation\n\nThermistors are used in circuits where temperature changes could affect performance. Such as in oscillators, battery charging circuits and power systems.\n\n## Inrush Current Limiting\n\nThermistors are used to limit the initial flow of current when a device is first turned on.\n\n## Voltage Divider\n\nThermistors are widely used as voltage divider. As shown in Fig. 9.36 when temperature of a thermistor increases, its resistance decreases. This decreases the voltage drop across the thermistor. As a result, the potential at point B increases that can be used to trigger a circuit connected to it. In case of a fire alarm, the use of a thermistor turns the NOT gate low when it\ngets heated. The output of NOT gate goes high and\nturns the siren ON\n\n### 9.21 LIGHT DEPENDENT RESISTOR\n\nLight dependent resistor (LDR) is a resistor whose resistance decreases with increasing light intensity. Due to this property, it is also known as photo resistor. The LDRs are typically made from semiconductor material like cadmium sulphide. The material is deposited in a special pattern on an insulating plate.\n\n## Working Principle\n\nThe principle used in an LDR is the increase in the conductivity of the material on exposing it to light. In darkness, the semiconductor material has a few free electrons (charge carriers) resulting in high resistance. When light photons hit the material, they\n\ntransfer energy to electrons in the outer orbits, thus, making them free to conduct electricity. This decreases the resistance of LDR. The amount of light hitting the LDR's surface determines the number of free elections. Conversely, less light results in lowering the free elections, thus, making higher resistance. This change in resistance can be measured and used in circuits to sense light levels.\n\n# Applications of LDRs\n\n## Light Sensors\n\nLDRs are commonly used in light sensing circuits such as automatic lighting systems in homes and street lights. An LDR works just like a switch that turns ON at dusk and OFF at dawn.\n\n## Camera Exposure Control\n\nLDRs help in adjusting the exposure time in cameras based on the amount of available light.\n\n## Voltage Divider\n\nIn a typical circuit, an LDR can be a part of voltage divider, that converts the resistance change into measurable voltage change. This voltage can then be read by a microcontroller or other control circuitry to perform actions based on light levels. A circuit is shown in Fig. 9.37 in which an LDR is used as voltage divider. In the dark, the LDR has a very high resistance as compared to the standard resistance ( 100 kD ) in the circuit. Therefore the voltage drop across the LDR is very large as registered by a voltmeter. When the LDR is exposed to light, the resistance of LDR decreases to very low. Now, the voltmeter registers a lower reading. Hence, the change in light intensity gives rise to change in voltage. Therefore, by connecting mid-point B to a NOT gate, LDR can be used as a switch.\n\n## Reliability of A Concrete Bridge\n\nInspectors can easily check the reliability of concrete bridge with the help of carbon fibers embedded in its slab. This is possible because of the conducting property of the carbon fibers. Let us know step by step how does it work?\n\n1. First step is to know the electrical properties of carbon fibers. Carbon fibers are known to be good conductors of electricity due to their high carbon content.\n2. Secondly, we can embed the carbon fibers within the slab of the concrete bridge during its construction.\nFig. 9.37\nFig. 9.38: Carbon fibre sheets\n\nThen we can connect them to form a conductors network.\n3. Inspectors can check the reliability of the concrete bridge by applying small electric current to the carbon fiber network. They can determine the integrity of the concrete structure by measuring the resistance of the network.\n4. The sensor installed into the network can show whether the electric resistance is changing or not. If the resistance remains the same over time, it indicates that the concrete bridge is maintaining its structural integrity. However, if the resistance increases, it means that the concrete is deteriorating or that the carbon fibers are being damaged.\nSome other methods are also used to check the strength of the concrete bridge. For example, a type of sensors continuously monitor strain, vibration and temperature. Internal flaws, such as cracks or voids are detected by using ultrasound waves.\n\n# QUESTIONS\n\n## Multiple Choice Questions\n\nTick ( $x$ ) the correct answer.\n9.1 Two point charges $A$ and $B$ are separated by 10 m .

Also, a changing magnetic field gives rise to a current in a conductor placed in it. Electromagnetism is a key area of physics that studies how electric charges and magnetic fields interact.\nIn 1820, Hans Christian Oersted found that electricity and magnetism are correlated.\nFig. 18.1:\nThe direction of magnetic field produced by a current\n\n## Magnetism started with todostone, a natural mineral discovered in ancient Törklyc. Lodestone, or magnetite $\\left(\\mathrm{Fe}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{4}\\right)$, can attract metals like iron and steel and aligns with the Earth's magnetic poles, leading to the invention of the compass.\n\nElectromagnetism is crucial for modern technology, including phones, computers, and medical devices. In this chapter, we will explore basic concepts like electric fields, magnetic forces, and electromagnetic induction, and see how these principles affect both natural phenomena and technology. Understanding these concepts help us appreciate how electromagnetism influences our world and drives innovation.\n\n# 10.1 FORCE ON A CURRENT-CARRYING CONDUCTOR IN A UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD\n\nIt has been observed experimentally that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. Consider a straight conductor carrying a steady current placed perpendicular to uniform magnetic field. Assume the direction of the current is out of the paper as shown by $\\oplus$ in Fig. 10.2. The direction of magnetic field produced by the current is also shown.\nJust as two magnets exert forces on each other through their magnetic fields, a current-carrying conductor experiences a force due to the interaction between its own magnetic field and the external magnetic field. To determine the direction of this force, consider the interaction between the two fields.\nFig. 10.2\n\nThe magnetic field produced by the current and the external uniform magnetic field reinforce each other on the left side of the conductor and oppose each other on the right side. Consequently, the conductor moves towards the side where the field is weaker. That is, the force on the conductor is directed to the right as viewed from the front. Thus, the force $F$ is perpendicular to both the conductor and the magnetic field. Fleming's lefthand rule is used to predict the direction of the force experienced by a current-carrying conductor in a magneticfield. To apply the rule:\n\nPosition your left hand such that the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field, the second finger points in the direction of current, the thumb will then point in the direction of force.\n\nThe Fleming's left hand rule is illustrated in Fig. 10.3.\nFig. 10.3\n\nHowever, direction of force can also be found by using right hand rule that can be stated as:\n\nCurl fingers of your right hand from current to magnetic field through smaller angle, the stretched thumb will indicate the direction of force.\n\nLet us now determine the magnitude of the force on a current-carrying conductor placed inside a magnetic field. Experimentally, it has been observed that the magnitude of the force acting on the conductor is directly proportional to the current $I$ in the conductor, the length $L$ of the conductor, and the strength of the external magnetic field $B$. The strength of the magnetic field is also known as the magnetic induction $B$, which has the same direction as the field. Thus, the force $F$ on a conductor of length $L$, carrying a current $I$ and placed perpendicular to a magnetic field of strength $B$, is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F \\propto B / L \\\\\n& F=k B / L\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn SI units, the value of $k=1$. Therefore,\n\n$$\nF=B / L\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. (10.1) we can see that $B=\\frac{F}{I L}$, so we can define $B$ as:\nThe magnetic strength is numerically equal to the force exerted on a conductor of length one metre carrying one ampere current, placed perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nEquation $B=\\frac{F}{I L}$ also gives us the unit of $B$. The SI unit of $B$ is tesla (T).\n\n$$\n1 \\mathrm{~T}=1 \\mathrm{NA}^{\\prime \\prime} \\mathrm{m}^{\\prime \\prime}\n$$\n\nIt may be noted that magnetic induction is a vector quantity. Its direction is the same as that of magnetic field.\nWe can also consider a vector $L$ which has a magnitude equal to the length of the conductor and its direction is along the flow of current.\nNow consider a conductor $L$ placed at an angle ' $\\theta$ ' w.r.t the magnetic field, then we will use the component of $L$ perpendicular to $B$ i.e., ( $L$ sin $\\theta$ ), as shown in Fig. 10.4. Then the Eq. (10.1) will become,\n\n$$\nF=B / L \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nIn the vector form the Eq. 10.2 can be written as\n\n$$\nF=I L \\times B\n$$\n\nEquation (10.2) shows that the force will be maximum (B/L) when the conductor is perpendicular to the field, i.e., $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$, and it will be zero when the conductor is along the field i.e., $\\theta=0$.\nThe Earth's magnetic field is approximately that of a dipole, like that of the fictitious bar magnet, where the south magnetic pole is towards the geographic north pole and the north magnetic pole is towards the geographic south pole.\n\nExample 10.1 A 20.0 cm wire carrying a current of 10.0 A is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.30 T . If the wire makes an angle of $40^{\\circ}$ with the direction of magnetic field, find the magnitude of the force acting on the wire.\n\n$$\n\\text { Solution Length of the wire }=L=20.0 \\mathrm{~cm}=0.20 \\mathrm{~m}\n$$\n\n| Physica III |  | (a) | Chaster 10 |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Current | $=1$ | $=10.0 \\mathrm{~A}$ |  |  |\n| Strength of magnetic field |  | $=B=0.30 \\mathrm{~T}$ |  |  |\n| Angle |  | $=9=40^{\\circ}$ |  |  |\n\nSubstituting the values in Eq. (10.2): $\\quad F=10.0 \\mathrm{A} \\times 0.30 \\mathrm{~T} \\times 0.20 \\mathrm{~m} \\times \\sin 40^{\\circ}=0.39 \\mathrm{~N}$\n\n# 10.2 MAGNETIC FLUX AND FLUX DENSITY\n\nWe can represent the strength of a magnetic field $B$ by the lines of force in the same way as for electric field. Then, the population of these lines in the field per unit area passing through a surface perpendicular to the field will represent the magnetic flux. Thus,\nThe magnetic flux through a patch of area $A$ is the number of magnetic lines passing through this area.\nIf $B$ represents the number of lines passing through unit area placed perpendicular to the field, then the total flux through area $A$ perpendicular to the field will be:\n\n$$\nB=\\frac{\\phi_{B}}{A}\n$$\n\nThe surface $A$ may not be perpendicular to the field, that is the normal to the surface makes an angle $\\theta$ with $B$ as shown in Fig. 10.5. Then, we will have to use component of $B$ (Bcos $\\theta$ ) along the vector area $A$ (Fig. 10.6). Therefore, the flux passing through the surface will be:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{B}=B A \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\nFig. 10.5\n\nAs $B$ and $A$ both are vectors, so we can write\n\n$$\n\\phi_{B}=B \\cdot A\n$$\n\nFig. 10.6\n\nEquation (10.6) shows that $\\phi_{B}$ is a scaler quantity. Therefore, we can define magnetic flux as:\nThe magnetic flux $\\phi_{B}$, through a plane element of area A in a uniform magnetic field B is given by dot product of $B$ and $A$.\n\nNote that $A$ is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the element and whose direction is along the normal to the surface of the element and $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the vectors $B$ and $A$ (Fig. 10.5). In Fig. 10.7(a), the field is directed along the normal to the area, so $\\theta$ is zero ( $\\cos 0^{\\circ}=1$ ) and the flux is maximum, equal to $B A$. When the field is parallel to the plane of the area (Fig. 10.7-b), the angle between the field and normal to area is $90^{\\circ}$ i.e., $\\theta=90^{\\circ}\\left(\\cos 90^{\\circ}=0\\right)$, so the flux through the area in this orientation is zero.\nFig. 10.7\n\nIn case of a curved surface placed in a uniform magnetic field, the curved surface is divided into a number of small surface elements, each element being assumed plane and the flux through the whole curved surface is calculated by the sum of the contributions from all the elements of the surface using Eq.(10.5).\nFrom the definition of tesla, the unit of magnetic flux is $\\mathrm{N} \\mathrm{m} \\mathrm{A}^{-}$which is called weber (Wb). According to Eq. 10.5, the magnetic induction $B$ is the flux per unit area of a surface perpendicular to $B$, hence, it is also called as magnetic flux density. Its unit is Wb $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. Therefore, magnetic induction, i.e. the magnetic field strength is measured in terms of $\\mathrm{Wb} \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ or $\\mathrm{NA}^{-1} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ (tesla).\nExample 10.2 A rectangular loop of wire is placed in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude 1.2 T . If the loop is 25 cm long and 20 cm wide, determine the magnetic flux through the loop for the three orientations as shown in Fig. 10.8.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n\nFig. 10.8\nSolution For orientation (a), angle between $B$ and area vector $A$ is $\\theta=60^{\\circ}$\nUsing\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi_{0} & =B A \\cos \\theta \\\\\n& =1.2 \\mathrm{~T} \\times 20 \\mathrm{~cm} \\times 25 \\mathrm{~cm} \\times \\cos 60^{\\circ} \\\\\n& =1.2 \\mathrm{~T} \\times 5 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\times 0.5 \\\\\n& =3 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~Wb}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor orientation (b), angle $\\theta=45^{\\circ}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi_{0} & =1.2 \\mathrm{~T} \\times 5 \\times 10^{2} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\times 0.707 \\\\\n& =4.2 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~Wb}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor orientation (c), angle $\\theta=30^{\\circ}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi_{c} & =1.2 \\mathrm{~T} \\times 5 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\times 0.866 \\\\\n& =5.2 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~Wb}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFig. 10.9\n\n# 10.3 MAGNETIC FLUX LINKAGE\n\nMagnetic flux linkage is a key concept in electromagnetism, particularly in the study of inductance and electromagnetic induction. Magnetic flux linkage refers to the product of the magnetic flux through a coil and the number of turns in the coil. It essentially measures how much magnetic flux is linked with the coil due to its multiple turns, and is an important factor in understanding how coils and inductors operate in electrical circuits.\nMagnetic flux linkage $=\\phi=N \\phi_{0} \\ldots \\ldots$ (10.7)\nwhere $\\phi_{0}$ is the magnetic flux through a single loop of area $A$ and $N$ is the total number of turns of the coil. Magnetic flux linkage plays a crucial role in the design and operation of transformers, electric motors, generators, and inductors. This concept is particularly important in Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which we will explore later in this chapter.\nA magnetic strip on the ATM card contains millions of tiny magnetic domains held together by a resin binder. The machine reads the information encoded on the magnetic strip and it makes your access to your account.\n\n### 10.4 MOTION OF A CHARGED PARTICLE IN A MAGNETIC FIELD\n\nWe have observed that a current-carrying conductor placed perpendicularly in a uniform magnetic field experiences a force $F$. Since a current is the flow of electric charges, it raises the question: do individual charges moving through a magnetic field also experience a force? The answer is yes. Experiments show that a charged particle does experience a force when it moves across a magnetic field. We can calculate this force by examining the behaviour of a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field.\nConsider a conductor of length $L$ through which $N$ charged particles, each with charge $q$, are passing in time $t$. The motion of these charged particles produces a current / in the conductor, which is given by\n\n$$\ni=\\frac{Q}{t}=\\frac{N q}{t}\n$$\n\n## Like electric field lines, magnetic field lines also never cross each other. However, they can attract or repel each other.\nwhere $Q$ is the total charge flowing in time $t$. If $v$ is the velocity of charged particles, then the velocity of the particles along the conductor is\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{v} \\mathbf{L}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{L}$ is the unit vector in the direction of the current. The sign of the force depends on whether the charge $q$ is positive or negative. However, the unit vector $\\mathbf{L}$ is directed along the direction of the current, which is the direction of motion of positive charges.\nSince the particles take time $t$ to move across the conductor of length $L$, therefore,",

          "title": "Special Theory of Relativity\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nAfter studying this chapter, the students will be able to:\n\n* Distinguish between inertial and non-inertial frames of reference.\n* Describe the significance of Einstein's assumption of the constancy of the speed of light.\n* Describe that if c is constant then space and time become relative.\n* State the postulates of Special theory of relativity\n* Explain qualitatively and quantitatively the consequences of special relativity\n\nSpecifically in the case of:\na. The relativity of simultaneity.\nb. The equivalence between mass and energy.\nc. Length contraction.\nd. Time dilation.\ne.

This led to the development of relativistic mechanics, which offered a more comprehensive framework than classical mechanics and fundamentally changed our view of the universe. Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, introduced in 1905, addressed these issues by proposing that the laws of Physics are the same for all observers and that the speed of light is constant, regardless of the observer's motion. This theory not only resolved the conflicts between classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory but also revolutionized our understanding of time, space, and motion, forming the basis of what is now known as modern physics. This chapter will explore how Einstein's theory reshaped our view of the universe and continues to influence our understanding of the physical world.\n\n### 11.1 RELATIVE MOTION\n\nConsider throwing a ball to your right. For someone facing you, this direction appears to his left. This illustrates that direction is a relative concept. Similarly, the state of rest or motion of an object depends on the observer. For example, the walls of a moving train\n\n# Physics II\n\nseem stationary to passengers inside the train but appear to be moving to someone standing on the ground. Thus, we cannot definitively say whether an object is absolutely at rest or in motion; all motions are relative to the observer or to the reference frame being used. This becomes evident with the following example: An observer in a closed train compartment uses the compartment as his frame of reference. To determine the train's motion, the observer crops a ball and measures the horizontal distance travelled by the ball, keeping the vertical distance the same in each case. It is assumed that the vertical distance is covered in \" $t$ \" seconds in all scenarios.\nCase (a): Suppose the train is stationary. In that case, the horizontal velocity of the ball will be zero, and the horizontal distance travelled will also be zero. In this scenario, the observations made by the observer inside the train and by someone outside the train will be identical. The ball will have fallen to a point on the floor directly below the point from where it was dropped (Fig. 11.1-a).\nCase (b): The train is moving with a uniform velocity $v_{v}$. When the ball is released, it has an initial horizontal velocity $v_{v}$ and behaves like a projectile. It travels a horizontal distance $v_{v} t$ in time $t$ it takes for the ball to reach the floor. Since both the train and the observer inside it are moving with the same velocity $v_{v}$, they both travel the same horizontal distance $v_{v} t$ in the same time $t$. Therefore, the observer inside the train sees that the ball falls to a point on the floor directly below where it was dropped. In contrast, an observer outside the train will see the ball following a projectile path, as shown in Fig. 11.1(b). Thus, observers in different frames of reference, moving with uniform velocity relative to each other, will perceive motion differently.\n### 11.2 FRAMES OF REFERENCE\n\nWe have discussed the most commonly used Cartesian Coordinate System. In effect, a frame of reference is any coordinate system relative to which measurements are taken. For example, the position of a table in a room can be described relative to the walls of the room, making the room the frame of reference. Similarly, the laboratory is the reference frame for measurements taken there. If the same experiment is performed in a moving train, the train becomes the frame of reference. The position of a spaceship can be\n\ndescribed relative to the positions of distant stars. A coordinate system based on these stars is then the frame of reference.\n\n# Inertial and Non-inertial Frame of Reference\n\nAn inertial frame of reference is defined as a coordinate system in which the law of inertia is valid. This means a body at rest remains at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force that produces acceleration. Other laws of nature also apply in such a system. For instance, a body placed on the Earth remains at rest unless an unbalanced force acts upon it, indicating that the Earth can be considered an inertial frame of reference. A body in a car moving with uniform velocity relative to the Earth also remains at rest, so the car is also an inertial frame of reference. Thus, any frame of reference moving with uniform velocity relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame.\nHowever, if the moving car is suddenly stopped or accelerated, the body inside no longer remains at rest. In such cases, the car is not an inertial frame of reference. Therefore, an accelerated frame of reference is a non-inertial frame. While Earth is rotating and revolving, making it strictly speaking a non-inertial frame, it is often treated as an inertial\nframe due to its relatively small acceleration.\n\n### 11.3 SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY\n\nThe theory of relativity deals with how observers in different states of relative motion describe physical phenomena. The special theory of relativity addresses problems involving inertial (non-accelerating) frames of reference. There is another theory, called the general theory of relativity, that deals with problems involving frames of reference that are accelerating relative to one another. The special theory of relativity is based on two postulates, which can be stated as follows:\nThe speed of light $c$ emitted by the flashlight is measured same by two observers, one moving in the car with speed $v$ and other standing on the road.\n\n1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames (Principle of Relativity).\n2. The speed of light in free space has the same value for all observers, regardless of the state of motion of the source or the observer (Principle of Constancy of Light).\nThe first postulate generalizes the fact that all physical laws are the same in frames of reference moving with uniform velocity relative to one another. If the laws of Physics differed for observers in relative motion, those observers could determine which was stationary and which was moving. However, such a distinction does not exist, implying that there is no way to detect absolute uniform motion.\nThe second postulate states the experimental fact that the speed of light in free space is a universal constant, denoted as $c\\left(c=3 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\right)$. Since $c$ is constant, space and time\n\nbecome relative. For example, if you are sitting in a train moving at the speed of light and you hold up a mirror in front of you at arm's length, you will still see your reflection in the mirror. This is because, according to the principle of relativity, no experiment can detect the constant motion of the train relative to the person inside it.\nThese simple postulates have far-reaching consequences. They include phenomena such as the slowing down of clocks and the contraction of lengths in moving reference frames as observed by a stationary observer. Some interesting results of the special theory of relativity can be summarized as follows, without going into their mathematical details.\n\n# The Relativity of Simultaneity\n\nIf two events in different locations are observed by one observer to be simultaneous, they will generally not be observed as simultaneous by another observer in a different frame of reference moving relative to the first observer. In other words, whether two events are seen as simultaneous depends on the observer's frame of reference.\nConsider a train equipped with light-operated doors. The light switch is located in the centre of the roof and is operated by a traveler standing in the middle of the compartment. When the train is travelling at half the speed of light, the traveler turns on the light. The light travels forward and backward at equal speed and reaches both doors at the same time. Consequently, the traveler sees both doors opening simultaneously. However, an observer outside the train will see the back door open before the front door. This is because the back door is moving towards the light waves, while the front door is moving away from the light waves.\n\n## Time Dilation\n\nIf you are in a frame of reference moving at constant velocity from which you cannot see any other frame of reference, there is no way to know if you are moving or at rest.\n\nAccording to the special theory of relativity, time is not an absolute quantity; it depends on the motion of the frame of reference.\nSuppose an observer is stationary in an inertial frame and measures the time interval between two events in this frame. Let this time interval be $t_{0}$. This is known as proper time. If the observer is moving with respect to the frame of events with relativistic velocity $v$, or if the frame of events is moving with respect to the observer with a uniform relativistic velocity $v$, the time measured by the observer will not be $t_{0}$, but rather $t$, given by\n\n$$\nt=\\frac{t_{0}}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}\n$$\n\nAs the quantity $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}$ is always less than one, so $t$ is greater than $t_{0}$ i.e., time has dilated or stretched due to the relative motion of the observer and the frame of reference of the events. This astonishing result applies to all timing processes-physical,\n\nchemical, and biological. Even the aging process of the human body is slowed by motion at very high speeds or relativistic speeds.\nFor example, if a traveler on a plane moving at 0.8 c picks up and opens a book, the event takes one second as measured by the traveler. However, to a person standing outside the plane, the same event takes 1.7 seconds.\n\n# Length Contraction\n\nThe distance from Earth to a stermesstured by an observer in a moving spaceship would appear smaller than the distance measured by an observer on the Earth. In other words, if you are in motion relative to two points that are a fixed distance apart, the distance between the two points appears shorter than if you were at rest relative to them. This effect is known as length contraction. Length contraction occurs only along the direction of motion; no such contraction is observed perpendicular to the direction of motion. The length of an object or the distance between two points measured by an observer who is at rest relative to them is called the proper length $\\ell_{0}$. If an object and an observer are in relative motion with speed $v$, then the contracted length $l$ is given by\n\n$$\nl-l_{0} \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\n$$\n\nLet a train that is measured to be 100 metres long when at rest travel at $80 \\%$ of the speed of light ( 0.8 c ). A person inside the train will measure its length as 100 metres. However, a person standing by the side of the track will observe the train to be only 60 metres long. This effect of relativity, which is the shortening of length in the direction of motion, is due to length contraction.\n\n## Mass Variation\n\nAccording to the special theory of relativity, the mass of an object is a variable quantity that depends on the object's speed. An object whose mass is measured at rest is called its rest mass $m_{s}$, will have an increased mass $m$ when observed to be moving at speed $v$. They are related by\n\n$$\nm=\\frac{m_{s}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\n$$\n\nThe increase in mass indicates the increase in inertia that an object has at high speeds. As $v$ approaches $c$, it requires a greater force to change the object's speed.\n\nAs\n\n$$\nv \\rightarrow c, \\frac{v}{c} \\rightarrow 1, \\quad \\text { therefore, } \\quad \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\nm \\rightarrow \\infty\n$$\n\nAn infinite mass would require an infinite force to accelerate it. Since infinite forces are not available, an object cannot be accelerated to the speed of light oin free space.\nIn our everyday life, we deal with speeds that are extremely small compared to the\n\nspeed of light. Even Earth's orbital speed is only $30 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, while the speed of light in free space is $300,000 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This is why Newton's laws are valid in everyday situations. However, when dealing with aubatomic particles moving at velocities approaching the speed of light, relativistic effects become very prominent, and experimental results cannot be explained without considering Einstein's equations.\n\n# 11.4 THE EQUILANCE BETWEEN MASS AND ENERGY\n\nAccording to the special theory of relativity, mass and energy are distinct entities but are interconvertible. The total energy $E$ and mass $m$ of an object are related by the expression:\n\n$$\nE=m c^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $m$ depends on the speed of the object. At rest, the energy equivalent of an object's mass $m_{0}$ is called its rest mass energy $E_{0}$. Thus,\n\n$$\nE_{0}=m_{0} c^{2}\n$$\n\nAs $m c^{2}$ is greater than $m_{0} c^{2}$, the difference of energy $\\left(m c^{2}-m_{0} c^{2}\\right)$ is due to the motion, and it represents the kinetic energy of the mass. Hence,\n\n$$\nK_{1} E_{1}=\\left(m-m_{0}\\right) c^{2}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 11.4, the change in mass $m$ due to change in energy $\\Delta E$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\Delta m=\\frac{\\Delta E}{c^{2}}\n$$\n\nBecause $c^{2}$ is a very large quantity, this implies that small changes in mass require very large changes in energy. In our everyday world, energy changes are too small to provide measurable mass changes. However, energy and mass changes in nuclear reactions are found to be exactly in accordance with the aforementioned equations.\n\n### 11.5 SPACE-TIME INRELATIVITY\n\nSpace is said to be a three-dimensional extent in which all objects and events occur. It provides a framework to define the position and motion of various objects under the influence of some force.\nTime measures the sequence and duration of events. In the theory of relativity, time is not absolute; it is considered the fourth dimension. For example, oscillatory motion, such as that of a swinging pendulum, relies on time to determine the frequency of oscillations. Another example is time dilation, a phenomenon discussed earlier in this chapter, where time passes more slowly for an observer moving at extremely high speeds compared to one at rest. The special theory of relativity explains that space and time are related to each other. It describes how space and time are influenced by gravity and speed, such as the bending of light around massive objects like stars.\nSpace-time is, in fact, a mathematical model that unifies space-time into a single continuum. It is a concept used to describe all points of space and time and their relation to each other. According to Einstein's theory, space-time is curved especially near\n\n# Physice II\n\nmassive bodies and for speeds approaching the speed of light. We can hypothetically visualize this as a fabric sheet. If a heavy ball is placed over this sheet, it curves as shown in Fig. 11.2.\nObjects such as stars and planets cause space-time to curve around themselves, much like an elastic fabric deforms when holding a ball. The more massive the object, the deeper the curve.\nFig. 11.2\n\nConsequently, we do not speak of a force of gravity acting on bodies. Instead, we say that bodies and light rays move along geodesics (analogous to straight lines in plane geometry) in curved space-time. Thus, a body at rest or moving slowly near a massive object would follow a geodesic toward that object.\nEinstein's theory provides a physical picture of how gravity works. Newton discovered the inverse square law of gravity but explicitly stated that he offered no explanation for why gravity should follow this law. Einstein's theory also describes gravity as following an inverse square law (except in strong gravitational fields), but it explains why this is so. This is why Einstein's theory is considered an advancement over Newton's, even though it encompasses Newton's theory and yields the same results as Newton's theory in all but very strong gravitational fields.\nThe bending of starlight caused by the Sun's gravity was measured during a solar eclipse in 1919. The results matched Einstein's theory rather than Newton's, leading to Einstein's theory being hailed as a scientific triumph. Another success of Einstein's theory was the detection of gravitational waves, produced by some celestial events causing disturbances (squeezes and stretches) in the curvature of space-time. These waves were detected in 2015 and announced in 2016.\nBending of starlight by the Sun. Light from the star A is deflected as it passes close to the Sun on its way to Earth. We see the star in the apparent direction $B$, shifted by the angle $\\phi$. Einstein predicted that $\\phi=1.745$ seconds of angle which was found to be the same during the solar eclipse of 1919.\n\nExample 11.1 The period of a pendulum is measured to be 3.0 s in the inertial reference frame of the pendulum.

Let it takes eight years to reach to the star, from the point of view of the observer on the Earth.

An electric force is the force which holds the positive and negative charges that make up atoms and molecules. The human body is composed entirely of atoms and molecules, thus we owe our existence to the electric force.\n\nA lightning flash\nFig 12.1 (a) Repulsive forces between like charges and (b) attractive forces between unike charges\n\n### 12.1 COULOMB'S LAW\n\nWe know that there are two kinds of charges, namely, positive and negative charges. The charge on an electron is assumed to be negative and charge on a proton is positive. Moreover, we also learnt that like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. Now we investigate the quantitative nature of these forces. The first measurement of the force between electric charges was made in 1874 AD by Charles Coulomb, a French military engineer. On the basis of these measurements, he deduced a law known as Coulomb's law. It states that\n\nThe force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. It is mathematically expressed as\n\n$$\nF \\propto \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad F=k \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $F$ is the magnitude of the mutual force that acts on each of the two point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}$ and $r$ is the distance between them. The force $F$ always acts along the line joining the two point charges (Fig. 12.1), $k$ is the constant of proportionality. Its value depends upon the nature of medium between the two charges and system of units in which $F, q$ and $r$ are measured. If the medium between the two point charges is free space and the system of units is SI, then $k$ is represented as\n\n$$\nk=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is an electrical constant, known as permittivity of free space. In SI units, its value is $8.85 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{Nm}^{2} \\mathrm{C}^{2}$. Substituting the value of $\\varepsilon_{0}$ the constant\n\n$$\nk=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}}=9 \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{Nm}^{2} \\mathrm{C}^{2}\n$$\n\nThus Coulomb's force in free space is\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}\n$$\n\nAs stated earlier, Coulombs' force is mutual force, it means that if $q_{1}$ exerts a force on $q_{2}$, then $q_{2}$ also exerts an equal and opposite force on $q_{1}$. If we denote the force exerted on $q_{2}$ by $q_{1}$ as $\\mathbf{F}_{21}$ and that on charge $q_{1}$ due to $q_{2}$ as $\\mathbf{F}_{12}$, then\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{12}=-\\mathbf{F}_{21}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of both these two forces is the same and is given by Eq. 12.3. To represent the direction of these forces we introduce unit vectors. If $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{21}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{1}$ to $q_{2}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{2}$ to $q_{1}$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbf{F}_{21}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{21} \\\\\n& \\mathbf{F}_{12}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe forces $\\mathbf{F}_{21}$ and $\\mathbf{F}_{12}$ are shown in Fig. 12.2 (a \\& b). It can be seen that $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{21}=-\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12}$, so Eqs. 12.5 (a \\& b) show that\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{21}=-\\mathbf{F}_{12}\n$$\n\nThe sign of the charges in Eqs. 12.5 (a \\& b) determine whether the forces are attractive or repulsive.\nWe shall now consider the effect of medium between the two charges upon the Coulomb's force. If the medium is an insulator, it is usually referred as dielectric. It has been found that the presence of a dielectric always reduces the electrostatic force as compared with that in free space by a certain factor which is a constant for the given dielectric. This constant is known as relative permittivity and is represented by $\\varepsilon$. The values of relaiive permittivity of different dielectrics are given in Table 12.1.\n\nThus the Coulomb's force in a medium of relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{r}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{F}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{r}} \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}\n$$\n\nIt can be seen in the table that $\\varepsilon_{r}$ for air is 1.0006 . This value is so close to one that with negligible error, the Eq. 12.3 gives the electric force in air.\n\nExample 12.1: Charges $q_{1}=100 \\mu \\mathrm{C}$ and $q_{2}=50 \\mu \\mathrm{C}$ are located in xy-plane at positions $\\mathbf{r}_{1}=3.0 \\mathrm{j}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{2}=4.0 \\mathrm{i}$ respectively,\nFig. 12.2\n\n| Material | $\\varepsilon_{r}$ |\n| :-- | :--: |\n| Vacuum | 1 |\n| Air (1 atm) | 1.0006 |\n| Ammonia (liquid) | $22-25$ |\n| Bakelite | $5-18$ |\n| Benzene | 2.284 |\n| Germanium | 16 |\n| Glass | $4.8-10$ |\n| Mice | $3-7.5$ |\n| Paraffined paper | 2 |\n| Plexiglas | 3.40 |\n| Rubber | 2.94 |\n| Teflon | 2.1 |\n| Transformer oil | 2.1 |\n| Water (distilled) | 78.5 |\n\nwhere the distances are measured in metres.

However one may question, (a) What are the origins of these forces?\n(b) How are these forces transmitted from one mass to another or from one charge to another?\n\nThe answer to (a) is still unknown; the existence of these forces is accepted as it is. That is why they are called basic forces of nature.\nTo describe the mechanism by which electric force is transmitted, Michael Faraday (1791-1867) introduced the concept of an electric field. According to his theory, it is the intrinsic property of nature that an electric field exists in the space around an electric charge. This electric field is considered to be a force field that exerts a force on other charges placed in that field. For example, a charge $q$ produces an electric field in the space surrounding it. This\n\nfield exists whether the other charges are present in space or not. However, the presence of field cannot be tested until another charge $q_{0}$ is brought into the field. Thus the field of charge $q$ interacts with $q_{0}$ to produce an electrical force. The interaction between $q$ and $q_{0}$ is accomplished in two steps: (a) the charge $q$ produces a field and (b) the field interacts with charge $q_{0}$ to produce a force $F$ on $q_{0}$. These two steps are illustrated in Fig. 12.4.\nIn this figure the density of dots is proportional to the strength of the field at the various points. We may define electric field strength or electric field intensity $E$ at any point in the field as\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{F}{q_{0}}\n$$\n\nwhere $F$ is the force experienced by a positive test charge $q_{0}$ placed at the point. The test charge $q_{0}$ has to be very small so that it may not distort the field which it has to measure.\nSince electric field intensity is force per unit charge, it is measured in newton per coulomb in SI units. It is a vector quantity and its direction is the same as that of the force $F$.\nThe force experienced by a test charge $q_{0}$ placed in the field of a charge $q$ in vacuum is given by Eq. (12.3). Eq. 12.7 can be used to evaluate electric intensity due to a point charge $q$ at a point distant $r$ from it. Place a positive test charge $q_{0}$ at this point. The Coulomb's force that this charge will experience due to $q$ is\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q q_{0}}{r^{2}} \\hat{r}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{r}$ is a unit vector directed from the point charge $q$ to the test point where $q_{0}$ has been placed, i.e., the point where the electric intensity is to be evaluated. By Eq. 12.7\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{F}{q_{0}}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q q_{0}}{r^{2}} \\hat{r} x \\frac{1}{q_{0}}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q}{r^{2}} \\hat{r}\n$$\n\nExample 12.2: Two positive point charges $q_{1}=16.0 \\mu \\mathrm{C}$ and $q_{2}=4.0 \\mu \\mathrm{C}$ are separated by a distance of 3.0 m , as shown in Fig. 12.5. Find the spot on the line joining the two charges where electric field is zero.\nSolution: Between the charges, the two field contribution has opposite directions, and electric field would be zero at a\nFig. 12.4 (a) Dots surrounding the positive charge indicate the presence of the electric field. The density of the dots is proportional to the strength of the electric field at different points. (b) Interaction of the field with the charge $q_{0}$\nFig. 12.5\n\nFig. 12.5 (a) A positive test charge $+q_{0}$ placed anywhere in the vicinity of a positive point charge $+q$, experiences a repulsive force directed radially outward. (b) the electric field lines are directed radially outward from the positive point charge $+q$.\nFig. 12.7 The electric field lines are directed radially inward towards a negative point charge $-q$.\npoint $P$, where the magnitude of $E_{1}$ equals that of $E_{2}$. In the Fig. 12.5, let the distance of $P$ from $q_{2}$ be $d$.\nAtP, $\\quad E_{1}=E_{2}, \\quad$ which implies that,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q_{1}}{(3.0-d)^{2}}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q_{2}}{d^{2}} \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad \\frac{16.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{C}}{9+d^{2}-6 d}=\\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{C}}{d^{2}} \\\\\n& d^{2}+2 d-3=0, \\quad \\text { which gives } d=+1 \\mathrm{~m},-3 \\mathrm{~m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThere are two possible values of $d$, the negative value corresponds to a location off to the right of both the charges where magnitudes of $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are equal but directions are same. In this case $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ do not cancel at this spot. The positive value corresponds to the location shown in figure and is the zero field location, hence, $d=+1.0 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n### 12.3 ELECTRIC FIELD LINES\n\nA visual representation of the electric field can be obtained in terms of electric field lines; an idea proposed by Michael Faraday. Electric field lines can be thought of a \"map\" that provides information about the direction and strength of the electric field at various places. As electric field lines provide information about the electric force exerted on a charge, the lines are commonly called \"lines of force\".\n\nTo introduce electric field lines, we place positive test charges each of magnitude $q_{0}$ at different places but at equal distances from a positive charge $+q$ as shown in the figure. Each test charge will experience a repulsive force, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 12.6(a). Therefore, the electric field created by the charge $+q$ is directed radially outward. Fig. 12.6 (b) shows corresponding field lines which show the field direction. Fig. 12.7 shows the electric field lines in the vicinity of a negative charge $-q$. In this case the lines are directed radially \"inward\", because the force on a positive test charge is now of attraction, indicating the electric field points inward.\n\nFigures 12.6 and 12.7 represent two dimensional pictures of the field lines. However, electric field lines emerge from the charges in three dimensions, and an infinite number of lines could be drawn.\n\nThe electric field lines \"map\" also provides information about\n\nthe strength of the electric field. As we notice in Figs. 12.6 and 12.7 that field lines are closer to each other near the charges where the field is strong while they continuously spread out indicating a continuous decrease in the field strength.\n\n# \"The number of lines per unit area passing perpendicularly through an area is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field\".\n\nThe electric field lines are curved in case of two identical separated charges. Fig. 12.8 shows the pattern of lines associated with two identical positive point charges of equal magnitude. It reveals that the lines in the region between two like charges seem to repel each other. The behaviour of two identical negatively charges will be exactly the same. The middle region shows the presence of a zero field spot or neutral zone.\n\nThe Fig. 12.9 shows the electric field pattern of two opposite charges of same magnitudes. The field lines start from positive charge and end on a negative charge. The electric field at points such as $1,2,3$ is the resultant of fields created by the two charges at these points. The directions of the resultant intensities is given by the tangents drawn to the field lines at these points.\n\nIn the regions where the field lines are parallel and equally spaced, the same number of lines pass per unit area and therefore, field is uniform on all points. Fig. 12.10 shows the field lines between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor. The field is uniform in the middle region where field lines are equally spaced.\n\nWe are now in a position to summarize the properties of electric field lines.\n\n1) Electric field lines originate from positive charges and end on negative charges.\n2) The tangent to a field line at any point gives the direction of the electric field at that point.\n3) The lines are closer where the field is strong and the lines are farther apart where the field is weak.\n4) No two lines cross each other. This is because $E$ has only one direction at any given point. If the lines cross, E could have more than one direction.\nFig. 12.8 The electric field lines for two identical positive point charges.\nFig. 12.9 Attractive forces between unlike charges\nFig. 12.10 In the central region of a parallel plate capacitor the electric field lines are parallel and evenly spaced, indicating that the electric field there has the same magnitude and direction at all points.\n\n# 12.4 APPLICATIONS OF ELECTROSTATICS\n\n## (i) Xerography (Photocopier)\n\nFig.12.11 illustrates a photocopy machine. The copying\nThis computer image shows the electric field lines generated by the fish at the top of the picture. Through the electric field, the presence of other fish can be detected, such as the one silhouetted at the bottom.\nFig. 12.11 The basics of photocopying. The lamp transfers an image of the page to the drum, which leaves a static charge. The drum collects toner dust and transfers it to the paper. The toner is melted onto the page.\nprocess is called xerography, from the Greek word \"xeros\" and \"graphos\", meaning \"dry writing\". The heart of machine is a drum which is an aluminium cylinder coated with a layer of selenium. Aluminium is an excellent conductor. On the other hand, selenium is an insulator in the dark and becomes a conductor when exposed to light; it is a photoconductor. As a result, if a positive charge is sprinkled over the selenium it will remain there as long as it remains in dark. If the drum is exposed to light, the electrons from aluminium pass through the conducting selenium and neutralize the positive charge.\n\nIf the drum is exposed to an image of the document to be copied, the dark and light areas of the document produce corresponding areas on the drum. The dark areas retain their positive charge, but light areas become conducting, lose their positive charge and become neutral.\n\nIn this way, a positive charge image of the document remains on the selenium surface. Then a special dry, black powder called \"toner\" is given a negative charge and spread over the drum, where it sticks to the positive charged areas.\nThe toner from the drum is transferred on to a sheet of paper on which the document is to be copied. Heated pressure\n\nrollers then melt the toner into the paper which is also given an excess positive charge to produce the permanent impression of the document.\n\n# (11) Inkjet Printers\n\nAn inkjet printer (Fig. 12.12 a) is a type of printer which uses electric charge in its operation. While shuttling back and forth across the paper, the inkjet printer \"ejects\" a thin stream of ink. The ink is forced out of a small nozzle and breaks up into extremely small droplets. During their flight, the droplets pass through two electrical components, a \"charging electrode\" and the \"deflection plates\" (a parallel plate capacitor). When the printhead moves over regions of the paper which are not to be inked, the charging electrode is left on and gives the ink droplets a net charge. The deflection plates divert such charged drops into a gutter and in this way such drops are not able to reach the paper. Whenever ink is to be placed on the paper, the charging control, responding to computer, turns off the charging electrode. The uncharged droplets fly straight through the deflection plates and strike the paper. Schematic diagram of such a printer is shown by Fig. 12.12 (b).\nFig. 12.12 (b) An inkjet printhead ejects a steady flow of ink droplets. The charging electrodes are used to charge the droplets that are not needed on the paper. Charged droplets are deflected into a gutter by the deflection plates, while uncharged droplets fly straight onto the paper.\nInkjet printers can also produce coloured copies.\n\n### 12.5 ELECTRIC FLUX\n\nWhen we place an element of area in an electric field, some of the lines of force pass through it (Fig. 12.13 a).\nThe number of the field lines passing through a certain element of area is known as electric flux through that area. It is usually denoted by Greek letter $\\Phi$. For example the flux $\\Phi$ through the area A in Fig. 12.13 (a) is 4 while the flux through B is 2.\nIn order to give a quantitative meaning to flux, the field lines are drawn such that the number of field lines passing through\nFig. 12.12 (a) An inkjet printer.\nFig. 12.13 (a) Electric flux through a surface normal to $E$.\n\nFig. 12.13 (b) Maximum\nFig. 12.13 (c) Minimum\nFig. 12.13 (d)\na unit area held perpendicular to field lines at a point represent the intensity $\\mathbf{E}$ of the field at that point. Suppose at a given point the value of $\\mathbf{E}$ is $4 \\mathrm{NC}^{-1}$. This means that if $1 \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$ area is held perpendicular to field lines at this point, 4 field lines will pass through it. In order to establish relation between electric flux $\\Phi_{+}$electric intensity $\\mathbf{E}$ and area $\\mathbf{A}$ we consider the Fig. 12.13 (b,c,d) which shows the three dimensional representation of the electric field lines due to a uniform electric field of intensity $\\mathbf{E}$.\nIn Fig. 12.13 (b), area is held perpendicular to the field lines, then $E A_{1}$ lines pass through it. The flux $\\Phi_{0}$ in this case is\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{0}=E A_{1}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{1}$ denotes that the area is held perpendicular to field lines. In Fig. 12.13 (c), area $A$ is held parallel to field lines and, as is obvious no lines cross this area, so that flux $\\Phi_{0}$ in this case is\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{0}=E A_{1}=0\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{1}$ indicates that $A$ is held parallel to the field lines. Fig. 12.13 (d) shows the case when $A$ is neither perpendicular nor parallel to field lines but is inclined at angle $\\theta$ with the lines. In this case we have to find the projection of the area which is perpendicular to the field lines. The area of this projection, (Fig. 12.13 d ) is $A \\cos \\theta$. The flux $\\Phi$ in this case is\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{0}=E A \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\nUsually the element of area is represented by a vector area $\\mathbf{A}$ whose magnitude is equal to the surface area $A$ of the element and whose direction is direction of normal to the area. The electric flux $\\Phi_{0}$ through a patch of flat surface in terms of $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{A}$ is then given by\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{0}=E A \\cos \\theta=\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the field lines and the normal to the area.\n\nElectric flux, being a scalar product, is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit is $\\mathrm{Nm}^{2} \\mathrm{C}^{-1}$.\n\n### 12.6 ELECTRIC FLUX THROUGH A SURFACE ENCLOSING A CHARGE\n\nLet us calculate the electric flux through a closed surface, in shape of a sphere of radius $r$ due to a point charge $q$\n\nplaced at the centre of sphere as shown in Fig. 12.14. To apply the formula $\\Phi_{n}=E$. A for the computation of electric flux, the surface area should be flat. For this reason the total surface area of the sphere is divided into $n$ small patches with areas of magnitudes $\\Delta A_{1}, \\Delta A_{2}, \\Delta A_{3}, \\ldots \\Delta A_{n}$. If $n$ is very large, each patch would be a flat element of area. The corresponding vector areas are $\\Delta A_{1}, \\Delta A_{2}, \\Delta A_{3}, \\ldots . \\Delta A_{n}$ respectively. The direction of each vector area is along perpendicular drawn outward to the corresponding patch. The electric intensities at the centres of vector areas $\\Delta A_{1}, \\Delta A_{2}, \\ldots \\Delta A_{n}$ are $E_{1}, E_{2}, \\ldots \\ldots . E_{n}$ respectively.\nAccording to Eq.12.12, the total flux passing through the closed surface is\n$\\Phi_{n}=E_{1}, \\Delta A_{1}+E_{2}, \\Delta A_{2}+E_{3}, \\Delta A_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots+E_{n}, \\Delta A_{n} \\ldots$\nThe direction of electric intensity and vector area is same at each patch. Moreover, because of spherical symmetry, at the surface of sphere,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|E_{1}\\right|=\\left|E_{2}\\right|=\\left|E_{3}\\right| & =\\ldots . .=\\left|E_{n}\\right|=E=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q}{r^{2}} \\\\\n\\Phi_{n} & =E \\Delta A_{1}+E \\Delta A_{2}+E \\Delta A_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots+E \\Delta A_{n} \\\\\n& =E \\times\\left(\\Delta A_{1}+\\Delta A_{2}+\\Delta A_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots+\\Delta A_{n}\\right) \\\\\n& =E \\times(\\text { total spherical surface area }) \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q}{r^{2}} \\times 4 \\pi r^{2} \\\\\n\\Phi_{n} & =\\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_{0}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow imagine that a closed surface $S$ is enclosing this sphere. It can be seen in Fig. 12.15 that the flux through the closed surface $S$ is the same as that through the sphere. So we can conclude that total flux through a closed surface does not depend upon the shape or geometry of the closed surface. It depends upon the medium and the charge enclosed.\n\n# 12.7 GAUSS'S LAW\n\nSuppose point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, \\ldots \\ldots, q_{n}$ are arbitrarily distributed in an arbitrary shaped closed surface as shown in Fig. 12.16. Using idea given in previous section, the electric flux passing through the closed surface is\nFig. 12.14 The total electric flux through the surface of the sphere due to a charge $q$ at its centre is $q / \\varepsilon_{0}$.\nFig. 12.15\nFig. 12.16\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Phi_{x}=\\frac{q_{1}}{\\varepsilon_{0}}+\\frac{q_{2}}{\\varepsilon_{0}}+\\frac{q_{3}}{\\varepsilon_{0}}+\\ldots \\ldots+\\frac{q_{n}}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\\n& \\Phi_{x}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\times\\left(q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots+q_{n}\\right) \\\\\n& \\Phi_{x}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\times \\text { (total charge enclosed by closed surface) } \\\\\n& \\Phi_{x}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\times Q\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q=q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\\ldots \\ldots+q_{n}$ is the total charge enclosed by closed surface. Eq. 12.16 is mathematical expression of Gauss's law which can be stated as,\n\"The flux through any closed surface is $1 / \\varepsilon_{0}$ times the total charge enclosed in it\".\n\n# 12.8 APPLICATIONS OF GAUSS'S LAW\n\nGauss's law is applied to calculate the electric intensity due to different charge configurations. In all such cases, an imaginary closed surface is considered which passes through the point at which the electric intensity is to be evaluated. This closed surface is known as Gaussian surface. Its choice is such that the flux through it can be easily evaluated. Next the charge enclosed by Gaussian surface is calculated and finally the electric intensity is computed by applying Gauss's law Eq.12.16. We will illustrate this procedure by considering some examples.\n\n## (a) Intensity of Field Inside a Hollow Charged\n\nFig. 12.17\n\nSuppose that a hollow conducting sphere of radius $R$ is given a positive charge $q$. We wish to calculate the field intensity first at a point inside the sphere.\nNow imagine a sphere of radius $R<R$ to be inscribed within the hollow charged sphere as shown in Fig. 12.17. The surface of this sphere is the Gaussian surface. Let $\\Phi$ be flux through this closed surface. It can be seen in the figure that the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surfaces is zero. Applying Gaussian law, we have\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{x}=\\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_{0}}=0\n$$\n\nSince $\\quad \\Phi_{x}=E \\cdot A=0$ as $A \\neq 0$, therefore, $E=0$\n\nThus the interior of a hollow charged metal sphere is a field free region. As a consequence, any apparatus placed within a metal enclosure is \"shielded\" from electric fields.\n\n## (b) Electric Intensity Due to an Infinite Sheet of Charge\n\nSuppose we have a plane sheet of infinite extent on which positive charges are uniformly distributed. The uniform surface charge density is, say, $\\sigma$. A finite part of this sheet is shown in Fig. 12.18. To calculate the electric intensity $E$ at a point $P$, close to the sheet, imagine a closed Gaussian surface in the form of a cylinder passing through the sheet, whose one flat face contains point $P$. From symmetry we can conclude that $\\mathbf{E}$ points at right angle to the end faces and away from the plane. Since $\\mathbf{E}$ is parallel to the curved surface of the cylinder, so there is no contribution to flux from the curved wall of the cylinder. While it will be, $E A+E A=2 E A$, through the two flat end faces of the closed cylindrical surface, where $A$ is the surface area of the flat faces (Fig. 12.18). As the charge enclosed by the closed surface is $\\sigma A$, therefore, according to Gauss's law,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Phi_{c}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\times \\text { charge enclosed by closed surface } \\\\\n& \\Phi_{c}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\times \\sigma A\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n2 E A=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\times \\sigma A\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{\\sigma}{2 \\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$\n\nIn vector form,\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}=\\frac{\\sigma}{2 \\varepsilon_{0}} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is a unit vector normal to the sheet directed away from it.\n\n## (c) Electric Intensity Between Two Oppositely Charged Parallel Plates\n\nSuppose that two parallel and closely spaced metal plates of infinite extent separated by vacuum are given opposite charges. Under these conditions the charges are essentially concentrated on the inner surfaces of the plates. The field lines which originate on positive charges on the inner face of one plate, terminate on negative charges on the inner face of the other plate (Fig. 12.19). Thus the charges\n\n## To eliminate stray electric field interference, circuits of sensitive electronics devices such as T.V and Computers are often enclosed within metal boxes.\nFig. 12.18 The closed surface is in the form of a cylinder whose one face contains the point $P$ at which electric intensity has to be determined.\nFig. 12.19 The lines of force between the plates are normal to the plates and are directed from the positive plate towards the negative one.\n\nFig 12.20 Dotted rectangle represents the cross section of Gaussian box with its top inside the upper metal plate and its bottom in the dielectric between the plates.\nare uniformly distributed on the inner surface of the plate in a form of sheet of charges of surface density $\\sigma=q / A$, where $A$ is the area of plate and $q$ is the amount of charge on either of the plates.\nImagine now, a Gaussian surface in the form of a hollow box with its top inside the upper metal plate and its bottom in the space between the plates as shown in Fig.12.20. As the field lines are parallel to the sides of the box, therefore, the flux through the sides is zero. The field lines are uniformly distributed on the lower bottom face and are directed normally to it. If $A$ is the area of this face and $E$ the electric intensity at its site, the flux through it would be $E A$. There is no flux through the upper end of the box because there is no field inside the metal plate. Thus the total flux $\\Phi_{x}$ through the Gaussian surface is $E A$. The charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is $\\sigma A$. Applying Gauss's law\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{x}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\times \\sigma A\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nE A=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\times \\sigma A\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$\n\nThe field intensity is the same at all points between the plates. The direction of field is from positive to negative plate because a unit positive charge anywhere between the plates would be repelled from positive and attracted to negative plate and these forces are in the same direction. In vector form\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\hat{r}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{r}$ is a unit vector directed from positive to negative plate.\n\n# 12.9 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL\n\nLet us consider a positive charge $q_{n}$ which is allowed to move in an electric field produced between two oppositely charged parallel plates as shown in Fig. 12.21 (a). The positive charge will move from plate $B$ to $A$ and will gain $K . E$. If it is to be moved from $A$ to $B$, an external force is needed to make the charge move against the electric field and will gain P.E. Let us impose a condition that as the charge is moved from $A$ to $B$, it is moved keeping electrostatic equilibrium, i.e., it moves with uniform velocity. This condition could be achieved by applying a force $\\mathbf{F}$ equal and opposite to $q_{n} \\mathbf{E}$ at every point along its path\n\nas shown in Fig. 12.21 (b). The work done by the external force against the electric field increases electrical potential energy of the charge that is moved.\nLet $W_{A B}$ be the work done by the force in carrying the positive charge $q_{0}$ from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium. The change in its potential energy $\\Delta U=W_{A B}$\nor\n\n$$\nU_{B}-U_{A}=W_{A B}\n$$\n\nwhere $U_{A}$ and $U_{B}$, are defined to be the potential energies at points $A$ and $B$, respectively.\nTo describe electric field we introduce the idea of electric potential difference. The potential difference between two points $A$ and $B$ in an electric field is defined as the work done in carrying a unit positive charge from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium, that is,\n\n$$\n\\Delta V=V_{B}-V_{A}=\\frac{W_{A B}}{q_{0}}=\\frac{\\Delta U}{q_{0}}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ are defined electric potentials at point $A$ and $B$ respectively. Electric potential energy difference and electric potential difference between the points $A$ and $B$ are related as\n\n$$\n\\Delta U=q_{0} \\Delta V=W_{A B}\n$$\n\nThus the potential difference between the two points can be defined as the difference of the potential energy per unit charge.\nAs the unit of P.E. is joule, Eq. 12.23 shows that the unit of potential difference is joule per coulomb. It is called volt such that,\n\n$$\n1 \\text { volt }=\\frac{1 \\text { joule }}{1 \\text { coulomb }}\n$$\n\nThat is, a potential difference of 1 volt exists between two points if work done in moving a unit positive charge from one point to other, keeping equilibrium, is one joule.\nIn order to give a concept of electric potential at a point in an electric field, we must have a reference to which we assign zero electric potential. This point is usually taken at infinity. Thus in Eq. 12.23, if we take $A$ to be at infinity and choose $V_{A}=0$, the electric potential at $B$ will be $V_{B}=W_{a B} / q_{0}$ or dropping the subscripts.\n\n$$\nV=\\frac{W}{q_{0}}\n$$\n\nFig. 12.21 (b)\nAn ECG records the \"voltage\" between points on human skin generated by electrical process in the heart. This ECG is made in running position providing information about the heart's performance under stress.\n\nIn electroencephalography the potential differences created by the electrical activity of the brain are used for diagnosing abnormal behaviour.\nwhich states that the electric potentlal at any point in an electric field is equal to work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point keeping it in equilibrium. It is to be noted that potential at a point is still potential difference between the potential at that point and potential at infinity. Both potential and potential differences are scalar quantities because both $W$ and $q_{n}$ are scalars.\n\n## Electric Field as Potential Gradient\n\nIn this section we will establish a relation between electric intensity and potential difference. As a special case, let us consider the situation shown in Fig. 12.21 (b). The electric field between the two charged plates is uniform, let its value be $E$. The potential difference between $A$ and $B$ is given by the equation\n\n$$\nV_{B}-V_{A}=\\frac{W_{A B}}{q_{B}}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{A B}=F d=-q_{n} E d$ (the negative sign is needed because $F$ must be applied opposite to $q_{n} E$ so as to keep it in equilibrium). With this, Eq. 12.27 becomes\n\n$$\nV_{B}-V_{A}=-\\frac{q_{B} E d}{q_{B}}=-E d\n$$\n\n$$\nE=-\\frac{\\left(V_{B}-V_{A}\\right)}{d}=-\\frac{\\Delta V}{d}\n$$\n\nIf the plates $A \\& B$ are separated by infinitesimally small distance $\\Delta r$, the Eq. 12.28 is modified as\n\n$$\nE=-\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta r}\n$$\n\nThe quantity $\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta r}$ gives the maximum value of the rate of change of potential with distance because the charge has been moved along a field line along which the distance $\\Delta r$ between the two plates is minimum. It is known as potential gradient. Thus the electric intensity is equal to the negative of the gradient of potential. The negative sign indicates that the direction of $E$ is along the decreasing potential.\nThe unit of electric intensity from Eq. 12.29 is volt/metre which is equal to NC ${ }^{-1}$ as shown below:\n\n$$\n1 \\frac{\\text { volt }}{\\text { metre }}=1 \\frac{\\text { joule/coulomb }}{\\text { metre }}=1 \\frac{\\text { newton } \\times \\text { metre }}{\\text { metre } \\times \\text { coulomb }}=1 \\frac{\\text { newton }}{\\text { coulomb }}\n$$\n\n# Electric Potential at a Point due to a Point Charge\n\nLet us derive an expression for the potential at a certain point in the field of a positive point charge $q$. This can be accomplished by bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point keeping the charge in equilibrium. The target can be achieved using Eq. 12.29 in the form $\\Delta V=-E \\Delta r$, provided electric intensity $E$ remains constant. However in this case $E$ varies inversely as square of distance from the point charge, it no more remains constant so we use basic principles to compute the electric potential at a point. The field is radial as shown in Fig. 12.22.\n\nLet us take two points $A$ and $B$, infinitesimally close to each other, so that $E$ remains almost constant between them. The distance of points $A$ and $B$ from $q$ are $r_{A}$ and $r_{B}$ respectively and distance of midpoint of space interval between $A$ and $B$ is $r$ from $q$. Then according to Fig. 12.22,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& r_{A}=r_{A}+\\Delta r \\\\\n& \\Delta r=r_{B}-r_{A}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs $r$ represents mid point of interval between $A$ and $B$ so\n\n$$\nr=\\frac{r_{A}+r_{B}}{2}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of electric intensity at this point is,\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q}{r^{2}}\n$$\n\nAs the points $A$ and $B$ are very close then, as a first approximation, we can take the arithmetic mean to be equal o geometric mean which gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{r}{r_{A}}=\\frac{r_{B}}{r}\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\nr^{2}=r_{A} r_{B}\n$$\n\nThus, Eq. 12.33 can be written as\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{q}{r_{A} r_{B}}\n$$\n\nNow, if a unit positive charge is moved from $B$ to $A$, the work lone is equal to the potential difference between $A$ and $B$,\n\n$$\nV_{A}-V_{B}=-E\\left(r_{A}-r_{B}\\right)\n$$\n\nFig. 12.22\n\n## Fish and other sea creatures produce electric fields in a variety of ways.

It can also be proved that Coulomb's electrostatic force is also conservative force. The electric force between two charges $F=\\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r^{2}}$, is similar in form to the gravitational force between the two point masses, $F=G \\frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{r^{2}}$. Both forces vary inversely with the square of the distance between the two charges or the two masses. However, the value of gravitational constant $G$ is very small as compared to electrical constant $\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}}$. It is because of this fact that the gravitational force is a very weak force as compared to electrostatic force. As regards their qualitative aspect, the electrostatic force could be attractive or repulsive while, on the other hand, gravitational force is only attractive. Another difference to be noted is that the electrostatic force is medium dependant and can be shielded while gravitational\n\n# 12.12 CHARGE ON AN ELECTRON BY MILLIKAN'S METHOD\n\nIn 1909, R.A Millikan devised a technique that resulted in precise measurement of the charge on an electron.\nFig. 12.23 (a)\nA schematic diagram of the Millikan oil drop experiment is shown in Fig. 12.23 (a). Two parallel plates $P P^{\\prime}$ are placed inside a container $C$, to avoid disturbances due to air currents. The separation between the plates is $d$. The upper plate $P$ has a small hole $H$, as shown in the figure. A voltage $V$ is applied to the plates due to which the electric field $E$ is setup between the plates. The magnitude of its value is $E=V / d$. An atomizer $A$ is used for spraying oil drops into the container through a nozzle. The oil drop gets charged because of friction between walls of atomizer and oil drops. These oil drops are very small, and are actually in the form of mist. Some of these drops happen to pass through the hole in the upper plate. The space between the plates is illuminated by the light coming from the source $S$ through the lens $L$ and window $\\mathrm{W}_{1}$. The path of motion of these drops can be carefully observed by a microscope $M$.\nA given droplet between the two plates could be suspended in air if the gravitational force $F_{g}=m g$ acting on the drop is equal to the electrical force $F_{e}=q E$, as shown in Fig. 12.23(b). The $F_{e}$ can be adjusted equal to $F_{g}$ by adjusting the voltage. In this case, we can write,\n\n$$\nF_{e}=F_{g}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nq E=m g\n$$\n\nIf $V$ is the value of $p$. $d$. between the plates for this setting, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nE=\\frac{V}{d}, \\quad \\text { we may write } \\quad q \\frac{V}{d}=m g \\\\\nq=\\frac{m g d}{V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nIn order to determine the mass $m$ of the droplet, the electric field between the plates is switched off. The droplet falls under the action of gravity through air. It attains terminal speed $v$, almost at the instant the electric field is switched off. Its terminal speed $v_{t}$ is determined by timing the fall of the droplet over a measured distance. Since the drag force $F$ due to air acting upon the droplet when it is falling with constant terminal speed is equal to its weight. Hence, using Stokes's law\n\n$$\nF=6 \\pi \\eta r v_{t}=m g\n$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the droplet and $\\eta$ is the coefficient of viscosity for air. If $p$ is the density of the droplet, then\n\n$$\nm=\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^{2} \\rho\n$$\n\nHence.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^{2} \\rho g & =6 \\pi \\eta r v_{t} \\\\\nr^{2} & =\\frac{9 \\eta v_{t}}{2 \\rho g}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nKnowing the value of $r$, the mass $m$ can be calculated by using Eq. (12.45). This value of $m$ is substituted in Eq. 12.44 to get the value of charge $q$ on the droplet.\nMillikan measured the charge on many drops and found that each charge was an integral multiple of a minimum value of charge equal to $1.6 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{C}$. He, therefore, concluded that this minimum value of the charge is the charge on an electron.\nExample 12.5: In Millikan oil drop experiment, an oil drop of mass $4.9 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~kg}$ is balanced and held stationary by the electric field between two parallel plates. If the potential difference between the plates is 750 V and the spacing between them is 5.0 mm , calculate the charge on the droplet. Assume $g=9.8 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$.\n\n# Solution:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Mass of drop }=m=4.9 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~kg} \\\\\n& \\text { Potential difference }=V=750 \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\n& \\text { Spacing between plates }=d=5.0 \\mathrm{~mm}=5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFig. 12.24\n\nFor Your Information\nOne farad is an enormous amount of capacitance.

It consists of two conductors placed near one another separated by vacuum, air or any other insulator, known as dielectric. Usually the conductors are in the form of parallel plates, and the capacitor is known as parallel plate capacitor. When the plates of such a capacitor are connected to a battery of voltage $V$ (Fig.12.24), it establishes a potential difference of $V$ volts between the two plates and the battery places a charge $+Q$ on the plate connected with its positive terminal and a charge $-Q$ on the other plate, connected to its negative terminal. let $Q$ be the magnitude of the charge on either of the plates. It is found that\n\n$$\nQ \\propto V \\text { or } Q=C V \\text { or } C=\\frac{Q}{V}\n$$\n\nThe proportionality constant $C$ is called the capacitance of the capacitor. As we shall see later, it depends upon the geometry of the plates and the medium between them. It is a measure of the ability of capacitor to store charge. The capacitance of a capacitor can be defined as the amount of charge on one plate necessary to raise the potential of that plate by one volt with respect to the other. The SI unit of capacitance is coulomb per volt, which because of its frequent use, is commonly called farad ( $F$ ), after the famous English scientist Faraday.\n\"The capacitance of a capacitor is one farad if a charge of one coulomb, given to one of the plates of a parallel plate capacitor, produces a potential difference of one volt between them\".\n\n### 12.14 CAPACITANCE OF A PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITOR\n\nConsider a parallel plate capacitor consisting of two plane metal plates, each of area $A$, separated by a distance $d$ as shown in Fig. 12.24. The distance $d$ is small so that the electric field $E$ between the plates is uniform and confined\n\nalmost entirely in the region between the plates. Let initially the medium between the plates be air or vacuum. Then according to Eq. 12.46,\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {vac }}=\\frac{Q}{V}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q$ is the charge on the capacitor and $V$ is the potential difference between the parallel plates. The magnitude $E$ of electric intensity is related with the distance $d$ by Eq. 12.28 as\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{V}{d}\n$$\n\nAs $Q$ is the charge on either of the plates of area $A$, the surface density of charge on the plates is as\n\n$$\n\\sigma=\\frac{Q}{A}\n$$\n\nAs already shown in section 12.8, the electric intensity between two oppositely charged plates is given by $E=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_{0}}$\nSubstituting the value of $\\sigma$, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{V}{d}=\\frac{Q}{A \\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$\n\nIt gives\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {vac }}=\\frac{Q}{V}=\\frac{A \\varepsilon_{0}}{d}\n$$\n\nIf an insulating material, called dielectric, of relative permittivity $\\varepsilon$, is introduced between the plates, the capacitance of capacitor is enhanced by the factor $\\varepsilon_{r}$. Capacitors commonly have some dielectric medium, thereby $\\varepsilon_{i}$ is also called as dielectric constant.\nFollowing experiment gives the effect of insertion of dielectric between the plates of a capacitor.\nConsider a charged capacitor whose plates are connected to a voltmeter (Fig. 12.25 a). The deflection of the meter is a measure of the potential difference between the plates. When a dielectric material is inserted between the plates, reading drops indicating a decrease in the potential difference between the plates (Fig. 12.25 b). From the definition, $C=Q / V$, since $V$ decreases while $Q$ remains constant, the value of $C$ increases. Then Eq. 12.50 becomes,\n\n$$\nC_{\\text {med }}=\\frac{A \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{r}}{d}\n$$\n\nFor Your Information\nThe electric field lines between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor. Smell bits of thread are suspended in oil and become aligned with the electric field. Note that the lines are equally spaced, indicating that the electric field there is uniform.\nFig. 12.25 Effect of a dielectric on the capacitance of a capacitor.\n\nEq. 12.50 shows the dependence of a capacitor upon the area of plates, the separation between the plates and medium between them.\n\nDividing Eq. 12.51 by Eq. 12.50 we get expression for dielectric constant as,\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{r}=\\frac{C_{\\text {med }}}{C_{\\text {vac }}}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 12.52 dielectric co-efficient or dielectric constant is defined as\n\"The ratio of the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor with an insulating substance as medium between the plates to its capacitance with vacuum (or air) as medium between them\".\n\n# 12.15 ELECTRIC POLARIZATION OF DIELECTRICS\n\nThe increase in the capacity of a capacitor due to presence of dielectric is due to electric polarization of dielectric.\nThe dielectric consists of atoms and molecules which are electrically neutral on the average, i.e, they contain equal amounts of negative and positive charges. The distribution of these charges in the atoms and molecules is such that the centre of the positive charge coincides with the centre of negative charge. When the molecules of dielectric are subjected to an electric field between the plates of a capacitor, the negative charges (electrons) are attracted towards the positively charged plate of the capacitor and the positive charges (nuclei) towards the negatively charged plate. The electrons in the dielectric (insulator) are not free to move but it is possible that the electrons and nuclei can undergo slight displacement when subjected to an electric field. As a result of this displacement the centre of positive and negative charges now no longer coincide with each other and one end of molecules shows a negative charge and the other end, an equal amount of positive charge but the molecule as a whole is still neutral. Two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance are said to constitute a dipole. Thus the molecules of the dielectric under the action of electric field become dipoles and the dielectric is said to be polarized.\nThe effect of the polarization of dielectric is shown in\n\nFig. 12.26. The positively charged plate attracts the negative end of the molecular dipoles and the negatively charged plate attracts the positive end. Thus the surface of the dielectric which is in contact with the positively charged plate places a layer of negative charges on the plate. Similarly the surface of the dielectric in contact with the negatively charged plate places a layer of positive charges. It effectively decreases the surface density of the charge $\\sigma$ on the plates. As the electric intensity $E$ between the plates is $\\frac{\\sigma}{E_{0}}$, so $E$ decreases due to\nFig. 12.26\npolarization of the dielectric. This results into a decrease of potential difference between the plates due to presence of dielectric as demonstrated by the experiment described in the previous section.\n\n# 12.16 ENERGY STORED IN A CAPACITOR\n\nA capacitor is a device to store charge. Alternatively, it is possible to think of a capacitor as a device for storing electrical energy. After all, the charge on the plate possesses electrical potential energy which arises because work is to be done to deposit charge on the plates. This is due to the fact that with each small increment of charge being deposited during the charging process, the potential difference between the plates increases, and a larger amount of work is needed to bring up next increment of charge.\nInitially when the capacitor is uncharged, the potential difference between plates is zero and finally it becomes $V$ when $q$ charge is deposited on each plate. Thus, the average potential difference is $\\frac{0+V}{2}=\\frac{1}{2} V$\nTherefore\n\n$$\n\\text { P.E. }=\\text { Energy }=\\frac{1}{2} q V\n$$\n\nUsing the relation $q=C V$ for capacitor we get\n\n$$\n\\text { Energy }=\\frac{1}{2} C V^{2}\n$$\n\nIt is also possible to regard the energy as being stored in electric field between the plates, rather than the potential energy of the charges on the plates. Such a view point is useful when electric field strength between the plates instead of charges on the plates causing field is to be considered. This relation can be obtained by substituting $V=E d$ and $C=A \\varepsilon_{r} c_{0} / d$ in Eq.12.53,\n\nFig. 12.27 Charging a capacitor\nFig. 12.28\n(b)\n(b)\n\nFig. 12.29 Discharging a capacitor\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Energy } & =\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{A \\varepsilon_{r} \\varepsilon_{c}}{d}\\right)(E d)^{2} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{r} \\varepsilon_{c} E^{2} \\times(A d)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs $(A d)$ is volume between the plates so\nEnergy density $=\\frac{\\text { Energy }}{\\text { Volume }}=\\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{r} \\varepsilon_{c} E^{2}$\nThis equation is valid for any electric field strength.\n\n### 12.17 CHARGING AND DISCHARGING A CAPACITOR\n\nMany electric circuits consist of both capacitors and resistors. Fig. 12.27 shows a resistor-capacitor circuit called R-C-circuit. When the switch $S$ is set at terminal $A$, the $R-C$ combination is connected to a battery of voltage $V_{c}$ which starts charging the capacitor through the resistor $R$.\nThe capacitor is not charged immediately, rather charges build up gradually to the equilibrium value of $q_{c}=C V_{e}$. The growth of charge with time for different resistances is shown in Fig.12.28. According to this graph $q=0$ at $t=0$ and increases gradually with time till it reaches its equilibrium value $q_{c}=C V_{c}$. The voltage $V$ across capacitor at any instant can be obtained by dividing $q$ by $C$, as $V=q / C$.\nHow fast or how slow the capacitor is charging or discharging, depends upon the product of the resistance $R$ and the capacitance $C$ used in the circuit. As the unit of product $R C$ is that of time, so this product is known as time constant and is defined as the time required by the capacitor to deposit 0.63 times the equilibrium charge $q_{c}$. The graphs of Fig. 12.28 show that the charge reaches its equilibrium value sooner when the time constant is small.\nFig. 12.29(a) illustrates the discharging of a capacitor through a resistor. In this figure, the switch $S$ is set at point $B$, so the charge $+q$ on the left plate can flow anti-clockwise through the resistance and neutralize the charge $-q$ on the right plate.\nThe graphs in Fig. 12.29(b) shows that discharging begins at $t=0$ when $q=C V_{c}$ and decreases gradually to zero. Smaller values of time constant $R C$ lead to a more rapid discharge.\n\nExample 12.6: The time constant of a series RC circuit is $t=R C$. Verify that an ohm times farad is equivalent to second.\nSolution: Ohm's law in terms of potential difference $V$, current $I$ and resistance $R$ can be written as,\n\n$$\nV=I R\n$$\n\nPutting $I=q / t$, this equation transforms into the equation,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV & =\\frac{q}{t} R \\\\\nR & =\\frac{V \\times t}{q}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAccording to equation $q=C V, C=q / V$\nMultiplying this equation with above equation gives,\n\n$$\nR C=\\frac{V \\times t}{q} \\times \\frac{q}{V}=t\n$$\n\nHence $\\quad 1$ ohm $\\times 1$ farad $=1$ second\nwhere ohm is the unit of resistance $R$.\n\n## SUMMARY\n\n- The Coulomb's law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n- Electric field force per unit charge at a point is called electric field strength or electric field intensity at that point.\n- The number of the field lines passing through a certain element of area is known as electric flux through that area, denoted by $\\Phi$.\n- The electric flux $\\Phi$ through a vector area $\\mathbf{A}$, in the electric field of intensity $\\mathbf{E}$ is given by $\\Phi=\\mathbf{E} . \\mathbf{A}=E A \\cos \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the field lines and the normal to surface area.\n- Gauss's law is stated as \"the flux through any closed surface is $1 / \\varepsilon_{0}$ times the total charge enclosed in it.\n- The interior of a hollow charged metal sphere is a field free region.\n- The electric intensity between two oppositely charged parallel plates is $E=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_{0}}$.\n- The amount of work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to a point against electric field is the electric potential at that point.\n\n- Capacitance of a capacitor is a measure of the ability of a capacitor to store charge.\n- The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is $C_{\\text {rac }}=\\frac{Q}{V}=\\frac{A E_{0}}{d}$.\n- The increase in the capacitance of a capacitor due to presence of dielectric is due to electric polarization of the dielectric.\n\n# QUESTIONS\n\n12.1 The potential is constant throughout a given region of space.

Alight bulb glows due to the flow of electric current. The current that flows through the coil of a motor causes its shaft to rotate. Most of the devices in the industry and in our homes\n\noperate with current. The electric current has become a necessity of our life.\n\n# 13.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT\n\nAn electric current is caused by the motion of electric charge. If a net charge $\\Delta Q$ passes through any cross section of a conductor in time $\\Delta t$, we say that an electric current $I$ has been established through the conductor where\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of current is ampere and it is a current due to flow of charge at the rate of one coulomb per second.\nMotion of electric charge which causes an electric current is due to the flow of charge carriers. In case of metallic conductors, the charge carriers are electrons. The charge carriers in electrolyte are positive and negative ions e.g., in a $\\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ solution the charge carriers are $\\mathrm{Cu}^{++}$and $\\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-}$, ions. In gases, the charge carriers are electrons and ions.\n\n## Current Direction\n\nWhen eel senses danger, it turns itself into a living battery. Any one who attacks this fish is likely to get a shock. The potential difference between the head and tail of an electric eel can be up to 600 V .\n\nEarly scientists regarded an electric current as a flow of positive charge from positive to negative terminal of the battery through an external circuit. Later on, it was found that a current in metallic conductors is actually due to the flow of negative charge carriers called electrons moving in the opposite direction i.e., from negative to positive terminal of the battery, but it is a convention to take the direction of current as the direction in which positive charges flow. This current is referred as conventional current. The reason is that it has been found experimentally that positive charge moving in one direction is equivalent in all external effects to a negative charge moving in the opposite direction. As the current is measured by its external effects so a current due to motion of negative charges, after reversing its direction of flow can be substituted by an equivalent current due to flow of positive charges. Thus\n\nThe conventional current in a circuit is defined as that equivalent current which passes from a point at higher potential to a point at a lower potential as if it represented a movement of positive charges.\n\nWhile analyzing the slectric circuit, we use the direction of the current according to the above mentioned convention.\n\nIf we wish to refer to the motion of electrons, we use the term electronic current (Fig. 13.1).\n\n# Current Through a Metallic Conductor\n\nIn a metal, the valence electrons are not attached to individual atoms but are free to move about within the body. These electrons are known as free electrons. The free electrons are in random motion just like the molecules of a gas in a container and they act as charge carriers in metals. The speed of randomly moving electrons depends upon temperature.\nIf we consider any section of metallic wire, the rate at which the free electrons pass through it from right to left is the same as the rate at which they pass from left to right (Fig. 13.2 a). As a result the current through the wire is zero. If the ends of the wire are connected to a battery, an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ will be set up at every point within the wire (Fig. 13.2 b). The free electrons will now experience a force in the direction opposite to E. As a result of this force the free electrons acquire a motion in the direction of -E. It may be noted that the force experienced by the free electrons does not produce a net acceleration because the electrons keep on colliding with the atoms of the conductor. The overall effect of these collisions is to transfer the energy of accelerating electrons to the lattice with the result that the electrons acquire an average velocity, called the drift velocity in the direction of -E (Fig. 13.2 b). The drift velocity is of the order of $10^{-3} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$, whereas the velocity of free electrons at room temperature due to their thermal motion is several hundred kilometres per second.\nThus, when an electric field is established in a conductor, the free electrons modify their random motion in such a way that they drift slowly in a direction opposite to the field. In other words the electrons, in addition to their violent thermal motion, acquire a constant drift velocity due to which a net directed motion of charges takes place along the wire and a current begins to flow through it. A steady current is established in a wire when a constant potential difference is maintained across it which generates the requisite electric field $E$ along the wire.\nExample 13.1: $1.0 \\times 10^{7}$ electrons pass through a conductor in $1.0 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$. Find the current in ampere flowing through the conductor. Electronic charge is $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$.\nSolution: Number of electrons $=n=1.0 \\times 10^{7}$\nFig. 13.1\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFig. 13.2\n\nCharge on an electron $=\\mathrm{e}=1.6 \\times 10^{-1} \\mathrm{C}$\nTime $=\\Delta t=1.0 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$\nCurrent / through the conductor is given by\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{\\pi e}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\n$I=\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{7} \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~s}}=1.6 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{Cs}^{-1}=1.6 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~A}$\n\n# 13.2 SOURCE OF CURRENT\n\nFig. 13.3 Conventional current flows from higher to lower potential through a wire.\nFig. 13.4 A source of current such as battery maintains a nearly constant potential difference between ends of a conductor.\n\nFor Your Information\nHeating effect of current is used in electric kettle.\n\nWhen two conductors at different potentials are joined by a metallic wire, current will flow through the wire. The current continues to flow from higher potential to the lower potential until both are at the same potential (Fig. 13.3). After this the current ceases to flow. Thus the current through the wire decreases from a maximum value to zero. In order to have a constant current the potential difference across the conductors or the ends of the wire should be maintained constant. This is achieved by connecting the ends of the wire to the terminals of a device called a source of current (Fig. 13.4).\nEvery source of current converts some non electrical energy such as chemical, mechanical, heat or solar energy into electrical energy. There are many types of sources of current. A few examples are mentioned below:\n(i) Cells (primary as well as secondary) which convert chemical energy into electrical energy.\n(ii) Electric generators which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n(iii) Thermo-couples which convert heat energy into electrical energy.\n(iv) Solar cells which convert sunlight directly into electrical energy.\n\n### 13.3 EFFECTS OF CURRENT\n\nThe presence of electric current can be detected by the various effects which it produces. The obvious effects of the current are:\n(i) Heating effect\n(ii) Magnetic effect\n(iii) Chemical effect\n\n# Heating Effect\n\nCurrent flows through a metallic wire due to motion of free electrons. During the course of their motion, they collide frequently with the atoms of the metal. At each collision, they lose some of their kinetic energy and give it to atoms with which they collide. Thus as the current flows through the wire, it increases the kinetic energy of the vibrations of the metal atoms. i.e., it generates heat in the wire. It is found that the heat $H$ produced by a current $I$ in the wire of resistance $R$ during a time interval $t$ is given by\n\n$$\nH=I^{2} R t\n$$\n\nThe heating effect of current is utilized in electric heaters, kettles, toasters and electric irons etc.\n\n## Magnetic Effect\n\nThe passage of current is always accompanied by a magnetic field in the surrounding space. The strength of the field depends upon the value of current and the distance from the current element. The pattern of the field produced by a current carrying straight wire, a coil and a solenoid is shown in Fig. 13.5 (a, b \\& c). Magnetic effect is utilized in the detection and measurement of current. All the machines involving electric motors also use the magnetic effect of current.\n\n## Chemical Effect\n\nCertain liquids such as dilute sulphuric acid or copper sulphate solution conduct electricity due to some chemical reactions that take place within them. The study of this process is known as electrolysis. The chemical changes produced during the electrolysis of a liquid are due to chemical effects of the current. It depends upon the nature of the liquid and the quantity of electricity passed through the liquid.\nThe liquid which conducts current is known as electrolyte. The material in the form of wire or rod or plate which leads the current into or out of the electrolyte is known as electrode. The electrode connected with the positive terminal of the current source is called anode and that connected with negative terminal is known as cathode. The vessel containing the two electrodes and the liquid is known as voltameter. As an example we will consider the electrolysis of copper sulphate solution. The voltameter contains dilute solution of copper sulphate. The anode and cathode are both copper plates\nFig. 13.5\n\nFig. 13.6\n(Fig. 13.6). When copper sulphate is dissolved in water, it dissociates into $\\mathrm{Cu}^{++}$and $\\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-}$ions. On passing current through the voltameter. $\\mathrm{Cu}^{++}$moves towards the cathode and the following reaction takes place.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cu}^{++}+2 \\mathrm{e}^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Cu}\n$$\n\nThe copper atoms thus formed are deposited at cathode plate. While copper is being deposited at the cathode, the $\\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-}$ions move towards the anode. Copper atoms from the anode go into the solution as copper ions which combine with sulphate ions to form copper sulphate.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cu}^{++}+\\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}\n$$\n\nAs the electrolysis proceeds, copper is continuously deposited on the cathode-while an equal amount of copper from the anode is dissolved into the solution and the density of copper sulphate solution remains unaltered.\nThis example also illustrates the basic principle of electroplating - a process of coating a thin layer of some expensive metal (gold, silver etc.) on an article of some cheap metal.\n\n# 13.4 OHM'S LAW\n\nWe have seen that when a battery is connected across a conductor, an electric current begins to flow through it. How much current flows through the conductor when a certain potential difference is set up across its ends? The answer to this question was given by a German Physicist George Simon Ohm. He showed by elaborate experiments that the current through a metallic conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends. This fact is known as Ohms' law which states that\n\"The current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends provided the physical state such as temperature etc. of the conductor remains constant\".\n\nSymbolically Ohm's law can be written as\n\n|  | $I \\propto V$ |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| It implies that | $V=R I$ |\n\nwhere $R$, the constant of proportionality is called the resistance of the conductor. The value of the resistance depends upon the nature, dimensions and the physical state of the conductor. In fact the resistance is a measure of the\n\nopposition to the motion of electrons due to their continuous bumping with the atoms of the lattice. The unit of resistance is ohm. A conductor has a resistance of 1 ohm if a current of 1 ampere flows through it when a potential difference of 1 volt is applied across its ends. The symbol of ohm is $\\Omega$. If $/$ is measured in amperes, $V$ in volts, then $R$ is measured in ohms i.e.,\n\n$$\nR(\\text { ohms })=\\frac{V(\\text { volts })}{I(\\text { amperes })}\n$$\n\nA sample of a conductor is said to obey Ohm's law if its resistance $R$ remains constant that is, the graph of its $V$ versus $/$ is exactly a straight line (Fig. 13.7). A conductor which strictly obeys Ohm's law is called ohmic. However, there are devices, which do not obey Ohms' law i.e., they are non ohmic. The examples of non ohmic devices are filament bulbs and semiconductor diodes.\nLet us apply a certain potential difference across the terminals of a filament lamp and measure the resulting current passing through it. If we repeat the measurement for different values of potential difference and draw a graph of voltage $V$ versus current $I$, it will be seen that the graph is not a straight line (Fig. 13.8). It means that a filament is a non ohmic device. This deviation of $I-V$ graph from straight line is due to the increase in the resistance of the filament with temperature - a topic which is discussed in the next section. As the current passing through the filament is increased from zero, the graph is a straight line in the initial stage because the change in the resistance of the filament with temperature due to small current is not appreciable. As the current is further increased, the resistance of the filament continues to increase due to rise in its temperature.\nAnother example of non ohmic device is a semiconductor diode. The current - voltage plot of such a diode is shown in Fig. 13.9. The graph is not a straight line so semi conductor is also a non ohmic device.\n\n# Review of Series and Parallel Combinations of Resistors\n\nIn an electrical circuit, usually, a number of resistors are connected together. There are two arrangements in which resistors can be connected with each other, one is known as series arrangement and other one as parallel arrangement.\nIf the resistors are connected end to end such that the same current passes through all of them, they are said to be connected in series as shown in Fig. 13.10(a). There\nFig. 13.7 Current - voltage graph of an ohmic material.\nFig. 13.8\nFig. 13.9\nFig. 13.10 (a)\n\nFig. 13.16 (b)\nequivalent resistance $R_{e}$ is given by\n\n$$\nR_{e}=R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}+\\cdots \\cdots\n$$\n\nIn parallel arrangement a number of resistors are connected side by side with their ends joined together at two common points as shown in Fig. 13.10(b). The equivalent resistance $R_{e}$ of this arrangement is given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_{e}}=\\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\\frac{1}{R_{3}}+\\cdots \\cdots\n$$\n\n# 13.5 RESISTIVITY AND ITS DEPENDENCE UPON TEMPERATURE\n\nIt has been experimentally seen that the resistance $R$ of a wire is directly proportional to its length $L$ and inversely proportional to its cross sectional area $A$. Expressing mathematically we have\n\n$$\nR \\propto \\frac{L}{A}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text { or } \\quad R=\\rho \\frac{L}{A}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is a constant of proportionality known as resistivity of specific resistance of the material of the wire. It may be noted that resistance is the characteristic of a particular wire whereas the resistivity is the property of the material of which the wire is made. From Eq. 13.6 we have\n\n$$\n\\rho=\\frac{R A}{L}\n$$\n\nThe above equation gives the definition of resistivity as the resistance of a metre cube of a material. The SI unit of resistivity is ohm-metre $(\\Omega \\mathrm{m})$.\nConductance is another quantity used to describe the electrical properties of materials. In fact conductance is the reciprocal of resistance i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\text { Conductance }=\\frac{1}{\\text { resistance }(R)}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of conductance is mho or siemen.\nLikewise conductivity, $\\sigma$ is the reciprocal of resistivity i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\sigma=\\frac{1}{\\rho}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of conductivity is ohm ${ }^{-1} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ or $\\mathrm{mh} \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. Resistivity of various materials are given in Table 13.1.\nIt may be noted from Table 13.1 that silver and copper are two best conductors. That is the reason that most electric wires are made of copper.\nThe resistivity of a substance depends upon the temperature also. It can be explained by recalling that the resistance offered by a conductor to the flow of electric current is due to collisions, which the free electrons encounter with atoms of the lattice. As the temperature of the conductor rises, the amplitude of vibration of the atoms in the lattice increases and hence, the probability of their collision with free electrons also increases. One may say that the atoms then offer a bigger target, that is, the collision cross-section of the atoms increases with temperature. This makes the collisions between free electrons and the atoms in the lattice more frequent and hence, the resistance of the conductor increases.\nExperimentally the change in resistance of a metallic conductor with temperature is found to be nearly linear over a considerable range of temperature above and below $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (Fig. 13.11). Over such a range the fractional change in resistance per kelvin is known as the temperature coefficient of resistance i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{R_{1}-R_{0}}{R_{0} t}\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{0}$ and $R_{t}$ are resistances at temperature $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $t^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. As resistivity $p$ depends upon the temperature, Eq. 13.6 gives $R_{0}=p_{0} L / A$ and $R_{0}=p_{0} L / A$\nSubstituting the values of $R_{t}$ and $R_{0}$ in Eq. 13.9, we get as\n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{p_{1}-p_{0}}{\\rho_{0} t}\n$$\n\nwhere $p_{0}$ is the resistivity of a conductor at $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $p_{1}$ is the resistivity at $t^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Values of temperature co-efficients of resistivity of some substances are also listed in Table 13.1.\nThere are some substances like germanium, silicon etc., whose resistance decreases with increase in temperature. i.e., these substances have negative temperature coefficients.\n\nExample 13.2: 0.75 A current flows through an iron wire when a battery of 1.5 V is connected across its ends.

They consist of a high-grade ceramic rod or cone (called the substrate) on which is deposited a thin resistive film of carbon. The numerical value of their resistance is indicated by a colour code which consists of bands of different colours printed on the body of the resistor. The colour used in this code and the digits represented by them are given in Table 13.2.\nUsually the code consists of four bands (Fig. 13.12). Starting from left to right, the colour bands are interpreted as follows:\n\n1. The first band indicates the first digit in the numerical value of the resistance.\n2. The second band gives the second digit.\n3. The third band is decimal multiplier i.e., it gives the number of zeros after the first two digits.\n4. The fourth band gives resistance tolerance. Its colour is either silver or gold. Silver band indicates a tolerance of $\\pm 10 \\%$, a gold band shows a tolerance of\n\n$\\pm 5 \\%$. If there is no fourth band, tolerance is understood to be $+20 \\%$. By tolerance, we mean the possible variation from the marked value. For example, a $1000 \\Omega$ resistor with a tolerance of $\\pm 10 \\%$ will have an actual resistance anywhere between $900 \\Omega$ and $1100 \\Omega$.\n\n# Rheostat\n\nIt is a wire wound variable resistance. It consists of a bare manganin wire wound over an insulating cylinder. The ends of the wire are connected to two fixed terminals $A$ and $B$ (Fig. 13.13 a). A third terminal $C$ is attached to a sliding contact which can also be moved over the wire.\n\nA rheostat can be used as a variable resistor as well as a potential divider. To use it as a variable resistor one of the fixed terminal say $A$ and the sliding terminal $C$ are inserted in the circuit (Fig. 13.13 b). In this way the resistance of the wire between $A$ and the sliding contact $C$ is used. If the sliding contact is shifted away from the terminal $A$, the length and hence the resistance included in the circuit increases and if the sliding contact is moved towards $A$, the resistance decreases. A rheostat can also be used as a potential divider.\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 13.14. A potential difference $V$ is applied across the ends $A$ and $B$ of the rheostat with the help of a battery. If $R$ is the resistance of wire $A B$, the current $I$ passing through it is given by $I=V / R$.\nThe potential difference between the portion $B C$ of the wire $A B$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV_{\\mathrm{ac}} & =\\text { current } x \\text { resistance } \\\\\n& =\\frac{V}{R} \\times r=\\frac{r}{R} V\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the resistance of the portion $B C$ of the wire. The circuit shown in Fig. 13.14 is known as potential divider. Eq.13.11 shows that this circuit can provide at its output terminals a potential difference varying from zero to the full potential difference of the battery depending on the position of the sliding contact. As the sliding contact $C$ is moved towards the end $B$, the length and hence the resistance $r$ of the portion $B C$ of the wire decreases which according to Eq. 13.11, decreases $V_{\\text {ac }}$. On the other hand if the sliding contact $C$ is moved towards the end $A$, the output voltage $V_{\\text {ac }}$ increases.\nFig. 13.13\nFig. 13.14\n\nFig. 13.15 Thermistors of different shapes.\n\n## For Your intonation\n\nA zero-ohm resistor is indicated by a single black colour band around the body of the resistor.\nFig. 13.16 The power of a battery appears as the power dissipated in the resistor $R$.\n\n## Thermistors\n\nA thermistor is a heat sensitive resistor. Most thermistors have negative temperature coefficient of resistance i.e., the resistance of such thermistors decreases when their temperature is increased. Thermistors with positive temperature coefficient are also available.\nThermistors are made by heating under high pressure semiconductor ceramic made from mixtures of metallic oxides of manganese, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron etc. These are pressed into desired shapes and then baked at high temperature. Different types of thermistors are shown in Fig.13.15. They may be in the form of beads, rods or washers.\nThermistors with high negative temperature coefficient are very accurate for measuring low temperatures especially near 10 K . The higher resistance at low temperature enables more accurate measurement possible.\nThermistors have wide applications as temperature sensors i.e., they convert changes of temperature into electrical voltage which is duly processed.\n\n### 13.7 ELECTRICAL POWER AND POWER DISSIPATION IN RESISTORS\n\nConsider a circuit consisting of a battery $E$ connected in series with a resistance $R$ (Fig. 13.16). A steady current $I$ flows through the circuit and a steady potential difference $V$ exists between the terminals $A$ and $B$ of the resistor $R$. Terminal A, connected to the positive pole of the battery, is at a higher potential than the terminal B. In this circuit the battery is continuously lifting charge uphill through the potential difference $V$. Using the meaning of potential difference, the work done in moving a charge $\\Delta Q$ up through the potential difference $V$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\text { Work done }=\\Delta W=V \\times \\Delta Q \\ldots \\ldots(13.12)\n$$\n\nThis is the energy supplied by the battery. The rate at which the battery is supplying electrical energy is the power output or electrical power of the battery. Using the definition of power we have\n\n$$\n\\text { Electrical power }=\\frac{\\text { Energy supplied }}{\\text { Time taken }}=V \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nSince\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}, s o\n$$\n\nElectrical power $=V \\times I$\nEq. 13.12a is a general relation for power delivered from a source of current $I$ operating on a voltage $V$. In the circuit shown in Fig.13.16 the power supplied by the battery is expended or dissipated in the resistor $R$. The principle of conservation of energy tells us that the power dissipated in the resistor is also given by Eq. 13.12.3\n\n$$\n\\text { Power dissipated }(P)=V \\times I\n$$\n\nAlternative equation for calculating power can be found by substituting $V=I R, I=V / R$ in turn in Eq. 13.13\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P=V \\times I=I R \\times I=I^{2} R \\\\\n& P=V \\times I=V \\times \\frac{V}{R}=\\frac{V^{2}}{R}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus we have three equations for calculating the power dissipated in a resistor.\n\n$$\nP=V \\times I, \\quad P=I^{2} R, \\quad P=\\frac{V^{2}}{R}\n$$\n\nIf $V$ is expressed in volts and $I$ in amperes, the power is expressed in watts.\n\n# 13.8 ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE (EMF) AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE\n\nWe know that a source of electrical energy, say a cell or a battery, when connected across a resistance maintains a steady current through it (Fig. 13.17). The cell continuously supplies energy which is dissipated in the resistance of the circuit. Suppose when a steady current has been established in the circuit, a charge $\\Delta Q$ passes through any cross section of the circuit in time $\\Delta t$. During the course of motion, this charge enters the cell at its low potential end and leaves at its high potential end. The source must supply energy $\\Delta W$ to the positive charge to force it to go to the point of high potential. The emf $E$ of the source is defined as the energy supplied to unit charge by the cell.\ni.e\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{\\Delta W}{\\Delta Q}\n$$\n\nFig. 13.17 Electromotive force of a cell.\n\nIt may be noted that electromotive force is not a force and we do not measure it in newtons. The unit of emf is joule/coulomb which is volt (V).\nThe energy supplied by the cell to the charge carriers is derived from the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy inside the cell.\nLike other components in a circuit a cell also offers some resistance. This resistance is due to the electrolyte present between the two electrodes of the cell and is called the internal resistance $r$ of the cell. Thus a cell of emf $E$ having an internal resistance $r$ is equivalent to a source of pure emf $E$ with a resistance rin series as shown in Fig. 13.18.\nLet us consider the performance of a cell of emf $E$ and internal resistance $r$ as shown in Fig. 13.19. A voltmeter of infinite resistance measures the potential difference across the external resistance $R$ or the potential difference $V$ across the terminals of the cell. The current / flowing through the circuit is given by\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{E}{R+r}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nE=I R+I r\n$$\n\nHere $I R=V$ is the terminal potential difference of the cell in the presence of current $I$. When the switch $S$ is open, no current passes through the resistance. In this case the voltmeter reads the emf $E$ as terminal voltage. Thus terminal voltage in the presence of the current (switch on) would be less than the emf $E$ by $/ r$.\nLet us interpret the Eq. 13.16 on energy considerations. The left side of this equation is the emf $E$ of the cell which is equal to energy gained by unit charge as it passes through the cell from its negative to positive terminal. The right side of the equation gives an account of the utilization of this energy as the current passes the circuit. It states that, as a unit charge passes through the circuit, a part of this energy equal to $I$ is dissipated into the cell and the rest of the energy is dissipated into the external resistance $R$. It is given by potential drop $I R$. Thus the emf gives the energy supplied to unit charge by the cell and the potential drop across the various elements account for the dissipation of this energy into other forms as the unit charge passes through these elements.\nThe emf is the \"cause\" and potential difference is its \"effect\". The emf is always present even when no current is drawn\n\nthrough the battery or the cell, but the potential difference across the conductor is zero when no current flows through it.\nExample 13.4: The potential difference between the terminals of a battery in open circuit is 2.2 V . When it is connected across a resistance of $5.0 \\Omega$, the potential falls to 1.8 V . Calculate the current and the internal resistance of the battery.\n\n# Solution:\n\nGiven $E=2.2 \\mathrm{~V}, \\quad R=5.0 \\Omega, \\quad V=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}$\nWe are to calculate $/$ and $r$.\nWe have\n\n$$\nV=1 R\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{V}{R}=\\frac{1.8 \\mathrm{~V}}{5.0 \\Omega}=0.36 \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\nInternal resistance $r$ can be calculated by using\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E=V+1 r \\\\\n& 2.2 \\mathrm{~V}=1.8 \\mathrm{~V}+0.36 \\mathrm{Ax} r \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\\\\n& r=1.11 \\mathrm{VA}=1.11 \\Omega\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## Maximum Power Output\n\nIn the circuit of Fig. 13.19, as the current / flows through the resistance $R$, the charges flow from a point of higher potential to a point of lower potential and as such, they loose potential energy. If $V$ is the potential difference across $R$, the loss of potential energy per second is $V I$. This loss of energy per second appears in other forms of energy and is known as power delivered to $R$ by current $I$.\n$\\therefore \\quad$ Power delivered to $R=P_{\\text {out }}=V I$\n\n$$\n=I^{2} R \\quad(\\because \\quad V=I R)\n$$\n\nAs\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{E}{R+r}\n$$\n\n$$\nP_{\\text {out }}=\\frac{E^{2} R}{(R+r)^{2}}=\\frac{E^{2} R}{(R-r)^{2}+4 R r}\n$$\n\nwhen $R=r$, the denominator of the expression of $P_{\\text {out }}$ is least and so $P_{\\text {out }}$ is then a maximum. Thus we see that maximum power is delivered to a resistance (load), when the internal resistance of the source equals the load resistance. The\n\n## A voltmeter connected across the terminals of a cell measures (a) the emf of the cell on open circuit, (b) the terminal potential difference on a closed circuit.\n\nvalue of this maximum output power as given by Eq. 13.17 is $\\frac{E^{2}}{4 R}$\n\n# 13.9 KIRCHHOFF'S RULES\n\nOhm's law and rules of series and parallel combination of resistance are quite useful to analyze simple electrical circuits consisting of more than one resistance. However such a method fails in the case of complex networks consisting of a number of resistors, and a number of voltage sources. Problems of such networks can be solved by a system of analysis, which is based upon two rules, known as Kirchhoff's rules.\n\n## Kirchhoff's First Rule\n\nIt states that the sum of all the currents meeting at a point in the circuit is zero i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\Sigma I=0\n$$\n\nIt is a convention that a current flowing towards a point is taken as positive and that flowing away from a point is taken as negative.\nConsider a situation where four wires meet at a point $A$ (Fig. 13.20). The currents flowing into the point $A$ are $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ and currents flowing away from the point are $I_{3}$ and $I_{4}$. According to the convention currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are positive and currents $I_{3}$ and $I_{4}$ are negative. Applying Eq. 13.18 we have\n\n$$\nI_{1}+I_{2}+\\left(-I_{3}\\right)+\\left(-I_{4}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nI_{1}+I_{2}=I_{3}+I_{4}\n$$\n\nUsing Eq. 13.19 Kirchhoff's first rule can be stated in other words as\n\nThe sum of all the currents flowing towards a point is equal to the sum of all the currents flowing away from the point.\n\nKirchhoff's first rule which is also known as Kirchhoff's point rule is a manifestation of law of conservation of charge. If there is no sink or source of charge at a point, the total charge flowing towards the point must be equal to the total charge flowing away from it.\n\n# Kirchhoff's Second Rule\n\nIt states that the algebraic sum of voltage changes in a closed circuit or a loop must be equal to zero. Consider a closed circuit shown in Fig. 13.21. The direction of the current / flowing through the circuit depends on the cell having the greater emf. Suppose $E_{1}$ is greater than $E_{2}$, so the current flows in counter clockwise direction (Fig. 13.21). We know that a steady current is equivalent to a continuous flow of positive charges through the circuit. We also know that a voltage change or potential difference is equal to the work done on a unit positive charge or energy gained or lost by it in moving from one point to the other. Thus when a positive charge $\\Delta Q$ due to the current $I$ in the closed circuit (Fig. 13.21), passes through the cell $E_{1}$ from low (-ve) to high potential ( +ve), it gains energy because work is done on it. Using Eq. 13.12 the energy gain is $E_{1} \\Delta Q$. When the current passes through the cell $E_{2}$ it loses energy equal to $-E_{2} \\Delta Q$ because here the charge passes from high to low potential. In going through the resistor $R_{1}$, the charge $\\Delta Q$ loses energy equal to $-I R_{1} \\Delta Q$ where $I R_{1}$ is potential difference across $R_{1}$. The minus sign shows that the charge is passing from high to low potential. Similarly the loss of energy while passing through the resistor $R_{2}$ is $-I R_{2} \\Delta Q$. Finally the charge reaches the negative terminal of the cell $E_{1}$ from where we started. According to the law of conservation of energy the total change in energy of our system is zero. Therefore, we can write\n\n$$\nE_{1} \\Delta Q-I R_{1} \\Delta Q-E_{2} \\Delta Q-I R_{2} \\Delta Q=0\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text { or } \\quad E_{1}-I R_{1}-E_{2}-I R_{2}=0\n$$\n\nwhich is Kirchhoff's second rule and it states that\n\n## The algebraic sum of potential changes in a closed circuit is zero.\n\nWe have seen that this rule is simply a particular way of stating the law of conservation of energy in electrical problems.\n\nBefore applying this rule for the analysis of complex network it is worthwhile to thoroughly understand the rules for finding the potential changes.\n\n(i) If a source of emf is traversed from negative to positive terminal, the potential change is positive, it is negative in the opposite direction.\n(ii) If a resistor is traversed in the direction of current, the change in potential is negative, it is positive in the opposite direction.\nExample 13.6: Calculate the currents in the three resistances of the circuit shown in Fig. 13.22.\n\n# Solution:\n\nFirst we select two loops abcda and ebcfe. The choice of loops is quite arbitrary, but it should be such that each resistance is included at least once in the selected loops.\nAfter selecting the loops, suppose a current $I_{1}$ is flowing in the first loop and $I_{2}$ in the second loop, all flowing in the same sense. These currents are called loop currents. The actual currents will be calculated with their help. It should be noted that the sense of the current flowing in all loops should essentially be the same. It may be clockwise or anticlockwise. Here we have assumed it to be clockwise (Fig. 13.22).\nWe now apply Kirchhoff's second rule to obtain the equations required to calculate the currents through the resistances. We first consider the loop abcda. Starting at a point 'a' we follow the loop clockwise. The voltage change while crossing the battery $E_{1}$ is $-E_{1}$ because the current flows through it from positive to negative. The voltage change across $R_{1}$ is $-I_{1} R_{1}$. The resistance $R_{2}$ is common to both the loops $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ therefore, the currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ simultaneously flow through it. The directions of currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ as flowing through $R_{2}$ are opposite, so we have to decide that which of these currents is to be assigned a positive sign. The convention regarding the sign of the current is that if we are applying the Kirchhoffs second rule in the first loop, then the current of this loop i.e, $I_{1}$ will be assigned a positive sign and all currents, flowing opposite to $I_{1}$ have a negative sign. Similarly, while applying Kirchhoffs second rule in the second loop, the current $I_{2}$ will be considered as positive and $I_{1}$ as negative. Using this convention the current flowing through $R_{2}$ is $\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right)$ and the voltage change across is - $\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right) R_{2}$. The voltage change across the battery $E_{2}$ is $E_{2}$. Thus the Kirchhoffs second rule as applied to the loop abcda gives\n\n$$\n-E_{1}-I_{1} R_{1}-\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right) R_{2}+E_{2}=0\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& -40 \\mathrm{~V}-I_{1} \\times 10 \\Omega-\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right) \\times 30 \\Omega+60 \\mathrm{~V}=0 \\\\\n& 20 \\mathrm{~V}-10 \\Omega \\times\\left[I_{1}+3\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right)\\right]=0 \\\\\n& 4 I_{1}-3 I_{2}=2 \\mathrm{~V} \\Omega^{-1}=2 \\mathrm{~A}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly applying Kirchhoff's second rule to the loop ebcfe, we get\n\n$$\n-E_{2}-\\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\\right) R_{2}-I_{2} R_{1}+E_{2}=0\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& -60 \\mathrm{~V}-\\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\\right) \\times 30 \\Omega-I_{2} \\times 15 \\Omega+50 \\mathrm{~V}=0 \\\\\n& -10 \\mathrm{~V}-15 \\Omega \\times\\left[I_{2}+2\\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\\right)\\right]=0 \\\\\n& 6 I_{1}-9 I_{2}=2 \\mathrm{~V} \\Omega^{-1}=2 \\mathrm{~A}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolving Eq. 13.21 and Eq. 13.22 for $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$, we get\n\n$$\nI_{1}=\\frac{2}{3} \\mathrm{~A} \\text { and } \\quad I_{2}=\\frac{2}{9} \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\nKnowing the values of loop currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ the actual current flowing through each resistance of the circuit can be determined. Fig. 13.22 shows that $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are the actual currents through the resistances $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. The actual current through $R_{2}$ is the difference of $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ and its direction is along the larger current. Thus\n\nThe current through $R_{1}=I_{1}=\\frac{2}{3} \\mathrm{~A}=0.66 \\mathrm{~A}$ flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from a to d.\n\nThe current through $R_{2}=I_{1}-I_{2}=\\frac{2}{3} \\mathrm{~A}-\\frac{2}{9} \\mathrm{~A}=0.44 \\mathrm{~A}$ flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from c to b.\n\nThe current through $R_{3}=I_{2}=\\frac{2}{9} \\mathrm{~A}=0.22 \\mathrm{~A}$ flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from $f$ to e.\n\n# Procedure of Solution of Circuit Problems\n\nAfter solving the above problem we are in a position to apply the same procedure to analyse other direct current complex networks. While using Kirchhoff's rules in other problems, it is worthwhile to follow the approach given below:\n(i) Draw the circuit diagram.\n(ii) The choice of loops should be such that each resistance is included at least once in the selected loops.\n\nFig. 13.23 Wheatstone bridge circuit\n(iii) Assume a loop current in each loop, all the loop currents should be in the same sense. It may be either clockwise or anticlockwise.\n(iv) Write the loop equations for all the selected loops. For writing each loop equation the voltage change across any component is positive if traversed from low to high potential and it is negative if traversed from high to low potential.\n(v) Solve these equations for the unknown quantities.\n\n# 13.9 WHEATSTONE BRIDGE\n\nThe Wheatstone bridge circuit shown in Fig. 13.23 consists of four resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ connected in such a way so as to form a mesh ABCDA. A battery is connected between points $A$ and $C$. A sensitive galvanometer of resistance $R_{5}$ is connected between points $B$ and $D$. If the switch $S$ is closed, a current will flow through the galvanometer. We are to determine the condition under which no current flows through the galvanometer even after the switch is closed. For this purpose we analyse this circuit using Kirchhoff's second rule. We consider the loops ABDA, BCDB and ADCA and assume anticlockwise loop currents $I_{1}, I_{2}$ and $I_{3}$ through the loops respectively. The Kirchhoff's second rule as applied to loopABDAgives\n\n$$\n-I_{1} R_{1}-\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right) R_{2}-\\left(I_{1}-I_{3}\\right) R_{3}=0\n$$\n\nSimilarly by applying the Kirchhoff's second rule to loop -BCDB we have\n\n$$\n-I_{2} R_{2}-\\left(I_{2}-I_{3}\\right) R_{4}-\\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\\right) R_{5}=0\n$$\n\nThe current flowing through the galvanometer will be zero if, $I_{1}-I_{2}=0$ or $I_{1}=I_{2}$. With this condition Eq. 13.23 and Eq. 13.24 reduce to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& -I_{1} R_{1}=\\left(I_{1}-I_{3}\\right) R_{4} \\\\\n& -I_{1} R_{2}=\\left(I_{2}-I_{3}\\right) R_{4}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDividing Eq. 13.25 by Eq. 13.26\n\n$$\n\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}=\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{4}}\n$$\n\nThus whenever the condition of Eq. 13.27 is satisfied, no current flows through the galvanometer and it shows no deflection, or conversely when the galvanometer in the Wheatstone bridge circuit shows no deflection, Eq. 13.27 is satisfied.\n\nIf we connect three resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ of known adjustable values and a fourth resistance $R_{4}$ of unknown value and the resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ are so adjusted that the galvanometer shows no deflection then, from the known resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ the unknown resistance $R_{4}$ can be determined by using Eq. 13.27.\n\n# 13.10 POTENTIOMETER\n\nPotential difference is usually measured by an instrument called a voltmeter. The voltmeter is connected across the two points in a circuit between which potential difference is to be measured. It is necessary that the resistance of the voltmeter be large compared to the circuit resistance across which the voltmeter is connected. Otherwise an appreciable current will flow through the voltmeter which will alter the circuit current and the potential difference to be measured. Thus the voltmeter can read the correct potential difference only when it does not draw any current from the circuit across which it is connected. An ideal voltmeter would have an infinite resistance.\nHowever, there are some potential measuring instruments such as digital voltmeter and cathode ray oscilloscope which practically do not draw any current from the circuit because of their large resistance and are thus very accurate potential measuring instruments. But these instruments are very expensive and are difficult to use. A very simple instrument which can measure and compare potential differences accurately is a potentiometer.\nA potentiometer consists of a resistor $R$ in the form of a wire on which a terminal $C$ can slide (Fig. 13.24 a). The resistance between $A$ and $C$ can be varied from 0 to $R$ as the sliding contact $C$ is moved from $A$ to $B$. If a battery of emf $E$ is connected across $R$ (Fig. 13.24 b), the current flowing through it is $I=E / R$. If we represent the resistance between $A$ and $C$ by $r$, the potential drop between these points will be $r I=r E / R$. Thus as $C$ is moved from $A$ to $B, r$ varies from 0 to $R$ and the potential drop between $A$ and $C$ changes from 0 to $E$. Such an arrangement also known as potential divider can be used to measure the unknown emf of a source by using the circuit shown in Fig. 13.25. Here $R$ is in the form of a straight wire of uniform area of cross section. A source of potential, say a cell whose emf $E$, is to be measured, is connected between $A$ and the sliding contact $C$ through a galvanometer G. It should be noted that the positive terminal of $E$, and that of\nFig. 13.24\nFig. 13.25\nthe potential divider are connected to the same point $A$. If, in\n\nthe loop AGCA, the point $C$ and the negative terminal of $E_{1}$ are at the same potential then the two terminals of the galvanometer will be at the same potential and no current will flow through the galvanometer. Therefore, to measure the potential $E_{1}$, the position of $C$ is so adjusted that the galvanometer shows no deflection. Under this condition, the emf $E_{1}$ of the cell is equal to the potential difference between $A$ and $C$ whose value $E r / R$ is known. In case of a wire of uniform cross section, the resistance is proportional to the length of the wire. Therefore, the unknown emf is also given by\n\n$$\nE_{1}=E \\frac{r}{R}=E \\frac{l}{L}\n$$\n\nwhere $L$ is the total length of the wire $A B$ and $l$ is its length from $A$ to $C$, after $C$ has been adjusted for no deflection. As the maximum potential that can be obtained between $A$ and $C$ is $E$, so the unknown emf $E_{1}$ should not exceed this value, otherwise the null condition will not be obtained. It can be seen that the unknown emf $E_{1}$ is determined when no current is drawn from it and therefore, potentiometer is one of the most accurate methods for measuring potential.\nThe method for measuring the emf of a cell as described above can be used to compare the emfs $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ of two cells. The balancing lengths $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ are found separately for the two cells. Then,\n\n$$\nE_{1}=E \\frac{t_{1}}{L} \\text { and } E_{2}=E \\frac{t_{2}}{L}\n$$\n\nDividing these two equations, we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{1}}{E_{2}}=\\frac{t_{1}}{t_{2}}\n$$\n\nSo the ratio of the emfs is equal to ratio of the balancing lengths.\n\n# SUMMARY\n\n- The electric current is said to be caused by the motion of electric charge.\n- The heat energy $H$ produced by a current $I$ in the wire of resistance $R$ during a time interval $t$ is given by $H=I^{2} R t$\n- The passage of current is always accompanied by a magnetic field in the surrounding space.\n\n- Certain liquids conduct electricity due to some chemical reaction that takes place within them.

At the same time, a changing magnetic field produces electric current. This interplay of electricity and magnetism is widely used in a number of electrical devices and appliances in modern age technology.\n\n# 14.1 MAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO CURRENT IN A LONG STRAIGHT WIRE\n\nTake a straight, thick copper wire and pass it vertically through a hole in a horizontal piece of cardboard. Place small compass needles on the cardboard along a circle with the centre at the wire. All the compass needles will point in the direction of $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{S}$. Now pass a heavy current through the wire. It will be seen that the needles will rotate and will set themselves tangential to the circle (Fig. 14.1 a). On reversing the direction of current, the direction of needles is also reversed. As the current through the wire is stopped, all the needles again point along the $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{S}$ direction.\nFollowing conclusions can be drawn from the above mentioned experiment:\n(i) A magnetic field is set up in the region surrounding a current carrying wire.\n(ii) The lines of force are circular and their direction depends upon the direction of current.\n(iii) The magnetic field lasts only as long as the current is flowing through the wire.\nThe direction of the lines of force can be found by a rule concluded directly from the above experiment which is stated as follows:\n\n## If the wire is grasped in fist of right hand with the thumb pointing in the direction of the current, the fingers of the hand will circle the wire in the direction of the magnetic field.\n\nThis is known as right hand rule and is illustrated in Fig. 14.1 (b).\n\n### 14.2 FORCE ON A CURRENT CARRYING CONDUCTOR IN A UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD\n\nWe have seen that a current carrying conductor sets up its own magnetic field. If such a conductor is placed in an external magnetic field, the magnetic field of the conductor will interact with the external magnetic field, as a result of which the conductor may experience a force. To demonstrate\nFig. 14.1 (a)\nFig. 14.1 (b)\n\n## If the middle finger of the right hand points in the direction of the magnetic field, the thumb in the direction of current, the force on the conductor will be normal to the palm towards the reader.\nFig. 14.3:\n\n## Fig. 14.2\n\nWhen a current is passed through the copper rod from a battery, the rod moves on the rails. The relative directions of the current, magnetic field and the motion of the conductor are shown in Fig. 14.3. It can be seen that the force on a conductor is always at right angles to the plane which contains the rod and the direction of the magnetic field. The magnitude of the force depends upon the following factors:\n(i) The force $F$ is directly proportional to $\\sin \\alpha$ where $\\alpha$ is the angle between the conductor and the field. From this, it follows that the force is zero if the rod is placed parallel to the field and is maximum when the conductor is placed at right angles to the field.\n\n$$\nF \\propto \\sin \\alpha\n$$\n\n(ii) The force $F$ is directly proportional to the current $I$ flowing through the conductor. The more the current, greater is the force.\n\n$$\nF \\propto I\n$$\n\n(iii) The force $F$ is directly proportional to the length $L$ of the conductor inside the magnetic field.\n\n$$\nF \\propto L\n$$\n\n(iv) The force $F$ is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. The stronger the field, the greater is the force. If we represent the strength of the field by $B$, then\n\n$$\nF \\propto B\n$$\n\nCombining all these factors,\n\n$$\nF \\propto I L B \\sin \\alpha\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nF=k / L B \\sin \\alpha\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is constant of proportionality. If we follow SI units, the value of $k$ is 1 . Thus in SI units\n\n$$\nF=I L B \\sin \\alpha\n$$\n\nEq.14.1 provides a definition for the strength of magnetic field. If $I=1 \\mathrm{~A}, L=1 \\mathrm{~m}$ and $\\alpha=90^{\\circ}$, then $F=B$. Thus $B$, the strength of magnetic field which is also known as magnetic induction is defined as the force acting on one metre length of the conductor placed at right angle to the magnetic field when 1 A current is passing through it. In SI units the unit of $B$ is tesla. A magnetic field is said to have a strength of one tesla if it exerts a force of one newton on one metre length of the conductor placed at right angles to the field when a current of one ampere passes through the conductor. Thus\n\n$$\n1 \\mathrm{~T}=1 \\mathrm{NA}^{-1} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}\n$$\n\nIt can be seen that the force on a current carrying conductor is given both in magnitude and direction by the following equation:\n\n$$\nF=I L \\times B\n$$\n\nwhere the vector $L$ is in the direction of current flow. The magnitude of the vector $/ \\mathrm{L} \\times \\mathrm{B}$ is $/ L B \\sin \\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is the angle between the vector $L$ and $B$. This gives the magnitude of the force. The direction of the force $F$ (Fig. 14.3) is also correctly given by the right hand rule of the cross product of vectors of $L$ and $B$ i.e., rotate $L$ to coincide with $B$ through the smaller angle. Curl the fingers of right hand in the direction of rotation. The thumb points in the direction of force. In some situations the direction of the force is conveniently determined by applying the following rule:\nConsider a straight current carrying conductor held at right angle to a magnetic field such that the current flows out of the plane of paper i.e., towards the reader as shown in Fig. 14.4. It is customary to represent a current flowing towards the reader by a symbol dot $(\\bullet)$ and a current flowing away from him by a cross ( $x$ ).\nIn order to find the direction of force, consider the lines of force (Fig. 14.4). The two fields tend to reinforce each other on left hand side of the conductor and cancel each other on the right side of it. The conductor tends to move towards the weaker part of the field i.e., the force on the conductor will be directed towards right in a direction at right angles to both the\n\n## Out of page\nInto page\nConvention to represent direction\nFig. 14.4 The magnetic force on the current carrying cono-cter placed at right angle to a magnacceild.\n\nconductor and the magnetic field. This rule is often referred as extension of right hand rule. It can be seen that the direction of the force is the same as given by the direction of the vector $L \\times B$.\n\nExample 14.1: A 20.0 cm wire carrying a current of 10.0 A is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.30 T . If the wire makes an angle of $40^{\\circ}$ with the direction of magnetic field, find the magnitude of the force acting on the wire.\n\n# Solution:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { Length of the wire }=L=20.0 \\mathrm{~cm}=0.20 \\mathrm{~m} \\\\\n\\text { Current }=1=10.0 \\mathrm{~A} \\\\\n\\text { Strength of magnetic field }=B=0.30 \\mathrm{~T} \\\\\n\\text { Angle }=\\alpha=40^{\\circ}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these values in the equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nF=1 B L \\sin \\alpha \\\\\nF=10.0 \\mathrm{~A} \\times 0.30 \\mathrm{~T} \\times 0.20 \\mathrm{~m} \\times \\sin 40^{\\circ}=0.39 \\mathrm{~N}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n### 14.3 MAGNETIC FLUX AND FLUX DENSITY\n\nLike electric flux, the magnetic flux $\\Phi_{B}$ through a plane element of area $\\mathbf{A}$ in a uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is given by dot product of $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{A}$ (Fig. 14.5).\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Phi_{B}=\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} \\\\\n& \\Phi_{B}=B A \\cos \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that $\\mathbf{A}$ is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the element and whose direction is along the normal to the surface of the element, $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the vectors $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{A}$.\n\nIn Fig. 14.5 (b) the field is directed along the normal to the area, so $\\theta$ is zero and the flux is maximum, equal to $B A$. When the field is parallel to the plane of the area (Fig. 14.5 c), the angle between the field and normal to area is $90^{\\circ}$ i.e., $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$, so the flux through the area in this position is zero.\n\nIn case of a curved surface placed in a non uniform magnetic field, the curved surface is divided into a number of small surface elements, each element being assumed plane and the flux through the whole curved surface is calculated by sum of the contributions from all the elements of the surface. From the definition of tesla, the unit of magnetic flux is $\\mathrm{NmA}^{-1}$ which is called weber (Wb).\n\nAccording to Eq.14.3, the magnetic induction $\\mathbf{B}$ is the flux per unit area of a surface perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$, hence it is also called as flux density. Its unit is then, $\\mathrm{Wbm}^{2}$. Therefore, magnetic induction, i.e., the magnetic field strength is measured in terms of $\\mathrm{Wbm}^{2}$ or $\\mathrm{NA}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{m}^{\\circ}$ (tesla).\nExample 14.2: The magnetic field in a certain region is given by $\\mathbf{B}=(40 \\hat{\\mathrm{i}}-18 \\hat{\\mathrm{k}}) \\mathrm{Wbm}^{2}$. How much flux passes through a $5.0 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ area loop in this region if the loop lies flat in the xy- plane?\n\n# Solution:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Magnetic induction } & =\\mathbf{B}=40 \\hat{\\mathrm{i}}-18 \\hat{\\mathrm{k}} \\\\\n\\text { Area of the loop } & =\\Delta \\mathbf{A}=5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\hat{\\mathrm{k}} \\\\\n\\text { Flux } & =\\Phi_{0}=\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{A} \\\\\n& =(40 \\hat{\\mathrm{i}}-18 \\hat{\\mathrm{k}}) \\cdot\\left(5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\hat{\\mathrm{k}}\\right) \\\\\n\\Phi_{0} & =90 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~Wb}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### 14.4 AMPERE'S LAW AND DETERMINATION OF FLUX DENSITY B\n\nWe know that an electric current produces a magnetic field. Ampere, after carrying out a series of experiments, generalized his results into a law known as Ampere circuital law by which the magnetic flux density $\\mathbf{B}$ at any point due to a current carrying conductor can be easily computed as explained below:\nConsider a closed path in the form a circle of radius $r$ enclosing the current carrying wire (Fig.14.6). This closed path is referred as Amperean path. Divide this path into small elements of length like $\\Delta \\mathrm{L}$. Let $\\mathbf{B}$ be the value of flux density at the site of $\\Delta \\mathrm{L}$. Determine the value of $\\mathbf{B} . \\Delta \\mathrm{L}$. If $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\Delta \\mathbf{L}$, then\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{B} . \\Delta \\mathbf{L}=B \\Delta L \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\n$B \\cos \\theta$ represents the component of $\\mathbf{B}$ along the element of length $\\Delta \\mathbf{L}$ i.e., Component of $\\mathbf{B}$ parallel to $\\Delta \\mathbf{L}$. Thus $\\mathbf{B} . \\Delta \\mathbf{L}$ represents the product of the length of the element $\\Delta \\mathbf{L}$ and the component of $\\mathbf{B}$ parallel to $\\Delta \\mathbf{L}$. Ampere stated that the sum of the quantities $\\mathbf{B} . \\Delta \\mathbf{L}$ for all path elements into which the complete loop has been divided equals $\\mu_{0}$ times the total current enclosed by the loop, where $\\mu_{0}$ is a constant, known\nFig. 14.6 Ampere's law to find the magnetic field in the vicinity of this long, straight, current-carrying wire.\n\nas permeability of free space. In SI units its value is $4 \\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~WbA}^{-1} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}$. This can be mathematically expressed as\n\n$$\n(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{1}+(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{2}+\\ldots .+(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{1}+\\ldots .+(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{N}=\\mu_{0} /\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{i}=\\mu_{0} /\n$$\n\nwhere ( $\\mathbf{B} . \\Delta \\mathbf{L}$ ), is the value of $\\mathbf{B} . \\Delta \\mathbf{L}$ along the $r$ th element and N is the total number of elements into which the loop has been divided. This is known as Ampere's circuital law.\n\n# Field Due to a Current Carrying Solenoid\n\nA solenoid is a long, tightly wound, cylindrical coil of wire. When current passes through such a coil, it behaves like a bar magnet. The magnetic field produced by it is shown in Fig. 14.7(a). The field inside a long solenoid is uniform and much strong whereas out side the solenoid, it is so weak that it can be neglected as compared to the field inside.\nThe value of magnetic filed $\\mathbf{B}$ can be easily determined by applying Ampere's circuital law. Consider a rectangular loop abcd as shown in Fig. 14.7 (b). Divide it into four elements of length $a b=\\ell_{1}, b c=\\ell_{2}, c d=\\ell_{3}$ and $d a=\\ell_{4}$.\nFig. 14.7\nApplying Ampere's law, we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4}(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{i}=\\mu_{0} \\times \\text { current enclosed }\n$$\n\n$(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{1}+(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{2}+(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{3}+(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{4}=\\mu_{0} \\times$ current enclosed\nNow we will calculate the value of $\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L}$ for each of the elements. First we will consider the element $a b=\\ell_{1}$ that lies inside the solenoid. Field inside the solenoid is uniform and is parallel to (Fig. 14.7b), so\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{1} & =\\ell_{1} B \\cos 0^{\\circ} \\\\\n& =\\ell_{1} B\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor the element $\\mathrm{cd}=\\ell_{3}$, that lies outside the solenoid, the field $\\mathbf{B}$ is zero, so\n\n$$\n(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{2}=0\n$$\n\nAgain $\\mathbf{B}$ is perpendicular to $\\ell_{2}$ and $\\ell_{4}$ inside the solenoid and is zero outside, so\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{2}=(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{2}=0 \\\\\n\\sum_{r=1}^{4}(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{L})_{r}=B \\ell_{1}=\\mu_{0} \\times \\text { current enclosed }\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nTo find the current enclosed, consider the rectangular surface bounded by the loop abcda.\nIf $n$ is the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid, the rectangular surface will intercept $n \\ell$, turns, each carrying a current $I$. So the current enclosed by the loop is $n \\ell_{1} I$. Thus Ampere's law gives\n\n$$\nB \\ell_{1}=\\mu_{0} \\times n \\ell_{1} I\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nB=\\mu_{0} n I\n$$\n\nThe field $\\mathbf{B}$ is along the axis of the solenoid and its direction is given by right hand grip rule which states \"hold the solenoid in the right hand with fingers curling in the direction of the current, the thumb will point in the direction of the field\".\n\nExample 14.3: A solenoid 15.0 cm long has 300 turns of wire.

The current through the conductor is because of the motion of charges. Actually the magnetic field exerts force on these moving charges due to which the conductor experiences force. We are interested in calculating the force exerted on the moving charges.\nFig. 14.8\n\n## The moving charge experiences a magnetic force $F$ because of the magnetic field $B$.\n\nConsider the situation as shown in Fig. 14.8 where we see a portion of the wire that is carrying a current $I$. Suppose there are $n$ charge carriers per unit volume of the wire, and that each is moving with velocity $v$ as shown. We will now find how long it takes for all the charge carriers originally in the wire segment shown to exit through the end area $\\mathbf{A}$.\nThe volume of the wire segment is $A L$. Because there are $n$ charge carriers per unit volume, the number of charge carrier in the segment is $n A L$. If the charge on a charge carrier is $q$, each of it, as it crosses the end area, will transport a charge $q$ through it. Assuming the speed of the carriers to be $v$, the carrier entering the left face of the segment takes a time $\\Delta t=L / v$ to reach the right hand face. During this time, all the charge carriers originally in the segment, namely $n A L$, will exit through the right hand face. As each charge carrier has a charge $q$, the charge $\\Delta Q$ that exits through the end area in time $\\Delta t=L / v$ is\n\n$$\n\\Delta Q=n A L q\n$$\n\nThen, from the definition of the current, the current / through the conductor is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI & =\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{n A L q}{L / v} \\\\\n& =n A q v\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy Eq.14.2, the force on the segment $L$ of a conductor, carrying current / is given by\n\n$$\nF_{1}=/ L \\times B\n$$\n\nSubstituting the value of the current /,\n\n$$\nF_{1}=n A q v L \\times B\n$$\n\nIn Fig.14.8, it can be seen that the direction of the segment $L$ is the same as the direction of the velocity of the charge carriers. If $L$ is a unit vector along the direction of the segment $L$ and $\\hat{v}$, a unit vector along the velocity vector $v$, then $\\hat{L}=\\hat{v}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv L & =v \\hat{L} L \\\\\n& =v \\hat{v} L=v L\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the value of $v \\mathbf{L}$ in Eq.14.7, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_{L} & =n A q(v L) \\times B \\\\\n& =n A L q v \\times B\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$n A L$ is the total number of charge carries in the segment $L$, so the force experienced by a single charge carrier is\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{F_{L}}{n A L}=q v \\times B\n$$\n\nThus the force experienced by a single charge carrier moving with velocity $v$ in magnetic field of strength $B$ is\n\n$$\nF=q(v \\times B)\n$$\n\nAlthough the Eq.14.8 has been derived with reference to charge carrier moving in a conductor but it does not involve any parameter of the conductor, so the Eq. 14.8 is quite general and it holds for any charge carrier moving in a magnetic field.\nIf an electron is projected in a magnetic field with a velocity $v$, it will experience a force which is given by putting $q=-e$ in Eq. 14.8 where $e$ is the magnitude of the electronic charge.\n\n$$\n\\therefore \\quad \\mathbf{F}=-e \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\n\nIn case of proton, $F$ is obtained by putting $q=+e$.\n\n$$\n\\therefore \\quad \\mathbf{F}=+e \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\n\nNote that in case of proton or a positive charge the direction of the force is given by the direction of the vector $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ i.e., rotate $\\mathbf{v}$ to coincide with $\\mathbf{B}$ through the smaller angle of rotation and curl the fingers of right hand in the direction of rotation. Thumb will point in the direction of the force. This is illustrated in Fig. 14.9 in which the proton enters into a magnetic field, as shown in figure, along the direction of dotted line. It experiences a force in the upward direction as given by the vector $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}$. As a result of this force the proton is deflected upwards as shown in Fig. 14.9. The direction of the force on a moving negative charge will be opposite to that of positive charge. Due to this force, the electron is deflected in the downward direction as it enters into a magnetic field. It\nMagnetic force $F$ is perpendicular to both the magnetic field $B$ and the velocity $v$ and causes the particle's trajectory to bend in a vertical plane.\n\nFig. 14.10\n\n## the electric force $F$ that acts on a positive charge is parallel to the electric field $E$ and causes the particle's trajectory to bend in a norizontal plane.\nmay be noted that the magnitude of the force on a moving charge carrier is $q v B \\sin \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is the angle between the velocity of the carrier and the magnetic field. It is maximum when $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$ i.e., when the charged particle is projected at right angles to the field. It is zero when $\\theta=0^{\\circ}$ i.e., a charged particle projected in the direction of the field experiences no force.\n\n### 14.6 MOTION OF CHARGED PARTICLE IN AN ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELD\n\nWhen an electric charge $q$ is placed in an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, It experiences a force $\\mathbf{F}$ parallel to electric field (Fig. 14.10). It is given by\n\n$$\nF=q E\n$$\n\nIf the charge is free to move, then it will accelerate according to Newton's second law as\n\n$$\na=\\frac{F}{m}=\\frac{q E}{m}\n$$\n\nIf electric field is uniform, then acceleration is also uniform and hence, the position of the particle at any instant of time can be found by using equations of uniformly accelerated motion.\nWhen a charge particle $q$ is moving with velocity $v$ in a region where there is an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$, the total force $\\mathbf{F}$ is the vector sum of the electric force $q \\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic force $q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$ that is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathbf{x}}+\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathbf{b}} \\\\\n\\mathbf{F}=q \\mathbf{E}+q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThis force $\\mathbf{F}$ is known as the Lorentz force. It is to be pointed out that only the electric force does work, while no work is done by the magnetic force which is simply a deflecting force.\n\n### 14.7 DETERMINATION OF e/m OF AN ELECTRON\n\nLet a narrow beam of electrons moving with a constant speed $v$ be projected at right angles to a known uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ directed into plane of paper. We have seen that electrons will experience a force\n\n$$\nF=-e \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\n\nThe direction of the force will be perpendicular to both $\\mathbf{v}$ and B. As the electron is experiencing a force that acts at right angle to its velocity, so it will change the direction of the velocity. The magnitude of velocity will remain unchanged. The magnitude of the force is evBsin $\\theta$. As $\\theta$ is $90^{\\circ}$, so $F=e v B$. As both $v$ and $B$ do not change, the magnitude of $F$ is constant. Thus the electrons are subjected to a constant force evB at right angle to their direction of motion. Under the action of this force, the electrons will move along a circle as shown in Fig. 14.11.\nThe magnetic force $F=B e v$ provides the necessary centripetal force $\\frac{m v^{2}}{r}$ to the electron of mass $m$ to move along a circular trajectory of radius $r$. Thus we have\n\n$$\nB e v=\\frac{m v^{2}}{r}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\frac{e}{m}=\\frac{v}{B r}\n$$\n\nIf $v$ and $r$ are known, $e / m$ of the electron is determined. The radius $r$ is measured by making the electronic trajectory visible. This is done by filling a glass tube with a gas such as hydrogen at low pressure. This tube is placed in a region occupied by a uniform magnetic field of known value. As electrons are shot into this tube, they begin to move along a circle under the action of magnetic force. As the electrons move, they collide with atoms of the gas. This excites the atoms due to which they emit light and their path becomes visible as a circular ring of light (Fig. 14.12). The diameter of the ring can be easily measured.\nIn order to measure the velocity $v$ of the electrons, we should know the potential difference through which the electrons are accelerated before entering into the magnetic field. If $V$ is this potential difference, the energy gained by electrons during their acceleration is Ve. This appears as the kinetic energy of electrons\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} & =\\text { Ve } \\\\\nv & =\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mathrm{Ve}}{m}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the value of $v$ in Eq. 14.13, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{e}{m}=\\frac{2 V}{B^{2} r^{2}}\n$$\n\nFig 14.11 An electron is moving perpendicular to a constant magnetic field. The magnetic force $F$ causes the particle to move on a circular path.\nFig. 14.12\n\nExample 14.4: Find the radius of an orbit of an electron moving at a rate of $2.0 \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ in a uniform magnetic field of $1.20 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~T}$.\n\n# Solution:\n\n| Speed of the electron | $=v=2.0 \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Magnetic field strength | $=B=1.20 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~T}$ |\n| Mass of the electron | $=m=9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}$ |\n| Charge on electron | $=e=1.61 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ |\n\nThe radius of the orbit is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& r=\\frac{m v}{e B} \\\\\n& =\\frac{9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{1.61 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C} \\times 1.20 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~T}} \\\\\n& r=9.43 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 14.5: Alpha particles ranging in speed from $1000 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ to $2000 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ enter into a velocity selector where the electric intensity is $300 \\mathrm{Vm}^{-1}$ and the magnetic induction 0.20 T .

It works by deflecting beam of electrons as they pass through uniform electric field between the two sets of parallel plates as shown in the Fig. 14.13(a). The deflected beam then falls on a fluorescent screen where it makes a visible spot.\n\nIt can display graphs of functions which rapidly vary with time. It is called cathode ray oscilloscope because it traces the desired waveform with a beam of electrons which are also called cathode rays.\n\nThe beam of the electrons is provided by an electron gun which consists of an indirectly heated cathode, a grid and three anodes. The filament $F$ heats the cathode $C$ which emits electrons. The anodes $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}$ which are at high positive potential with respect to cathode, accelerate as well as focus the electronic beam to fixed spot on the screen $S$. The grid $G$ is at a negative potential with respect to cathode. It controls the number of electrons which are accelerated by anodes, and thus it controls the brightness of the spot formed on the screen.\n\nNow we would explain how the waveform of various voltages is formed in CRO.\n\nThe two set of deflecting plates, shown in Fig. 14.13(a) are usually referred as $x$ and $y$ deflection plates because a voltage applied between the $x$ plates deflects the beam horizontally on the screen i.e., parallel to $x$-axis. A voltage applied across the $y$ plates deflects the beam vertically on the screen i.e., along the $y$-axis. The voltage that is applied across the $x$ plates is usually provided by a circuit that is built in the CRO. It is known as sweep or time base generator. Its output waveform is a saw tooth voltage of period $T$ (Fig. 14.13-b). The voltage increases linearly with time for a period $T$ and then drops to zero. As this voltage is impressed across the $x$ plates, the spot is deflected linearly with time along the $x$-axis for a time $T$. Then the spot returns to its starting point on the screen very quickly because a saw tooth voltage rapidly falls to its initial value at the end of each\n\nFig. 14.13 (a)\nSaw tooth voltage waveform\nFig. 14.13 (b)\nFig. 14.13 (b)\nhree dimensional view of CRO\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFig. 14.14\nperiod. We can actually see the spot moving on the $x$-axis. If the time period $T$ is very short, we see just a bright line on the screen.\n\nIf a sinusoidal voltage is applied across the $y$ plates when, simultaneously, the time base voltage is impressed across the $x$ plates, the sinusoidal voltage, which itself gives rise to a vertical line, will now spread out and will appear as a sinusoidal trace on the screen. The pattern will appear stationary only if the time $T$ is equal to or is some multiple of the time of one cycle of the voltage on y plates. It is thus necessary to synchronize the frequency of the time base generator with the frequency of the voltage at the $y$ plates. This is possible by adjusting the synchronization controls provided on the front panel of the CRO.\n\n# Uans ofCRO\n\nThe CRO is used for displaying the waveform of a given voltage. Once the waveform is displayed, we can measure the voltage, its frequency and phase. For example, Fig. 14.14(a) shows the waveform of an alternating voltage. As the $y$-axis is calibrated in volts and the $x$-axis in time, we can easily find the instantaneous value and peak value of the voltage. The time period can also be determined by using the time calibration of $x$-axis. Information about the phase difference between two voltages can be obtained by simultaneously displaying their waveforms. For example, the waveforms of two voltages are shown in Fig. 14.14(b). These waveforms show that when the voltage of I is increasing, that of II is decreasing and vice versa. Thus the phase difference between these voltages is $180^{\\circ}$.\n\n### 14.9 TORQUE ONACURRENT CARRYING COIL\n\nConsider a rectangular coil carrying a current $I$. The coil is capable of rotation about an axis. Suppose it is placed in uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ with its plane along the field (Fig. 14.15). We know that a current carrying conductor of length $L$ when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force $F=I L B$ sin $\\theta$ where $\\theta$ is the angle between conductor and the field. In case of sides $A B$ and $C D$ of the coil, the angle $\\theta$ is zero or $180^{\\circ}$, so the force on these sides will be zero. In case of sides $D A$ and $B C$, the angle $\\theta$ is $90^{\\circ}$ and the force on these sides will be\n\n$$\nF_{1}=F_{2}=I L B\n$$\n\nwhere $L$ is the length of these sides, $F_{1}$ is the force on the side $D A$ and $F_{2}$ on $B C$. The direction of the force is given by the vector $/ \\mathbf{L} \\times \\mathbf{B}$. It can be seen that $F_{1}$ is directed out of the plane of paper and $F_{2}$ into the plane of paper (Fig. 14.15 a). Therefore, the forces $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ being equal and opposite form a couple which tends to rotate it about the axis. The torque of this couple is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\tau & =\\text { Force } \\times \\text { Momentarm } \\\\\n& =I L B \\times a\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ is the moment arm of the couple and is equal to the length of the side $A B$ or $C D$. La is the area $A$ of the coil,\n\n$$\n\\tau=I B A\n$$\n\nNote that the Eq. 14.15 gives the value of torque when the field $B$ is in the plane of the coil. However if the field makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the plane of the coil, as shown in Fig 14.15(b), the moment arm now becomes a $\\cos \\alpha$. So\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\tau=I L B \\times \\operatorname{acos} \\alpha \\\\\n& \\tau=I B A \\cos \\alpha\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\nFig 14.15 (a)\n(Top view of coil)\nFig 14.15 (b)\n\n# 14.10 GALVANOMETER\n\nA galvanometer is an electrical instrument used to detect the passage of current. Its working depends upon the fact that when a conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experience a force as soon as a current passes through it. Due to this force, a torque $\\tau$ acts upon the conductor if it is in the form of a coil or loop.\n\n$$\n\\tau=N / B A \\cos \\alpha\n$$\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of turns in the coil, $A$ is its area, $I$ is current passing through it, $B$ is the magnetic field in which the coil is placed such that its plane makes an angle a with the direction of $\\mathbf{B}$. Due to action of the torque, the coil rotates and\n\n(a)\nFig. 14.16 (a) Moving coil galvanometer (b) Concave pole piece and soft iron cylinder makes the field radial and stronger.\nthus it detects the current. The construction of a moving coil galvanometer is shown in Fig. 14.16 (a).\nA rectangular coil $C$ is suspended between the concave shaped poles $N$ and $S$ of a $U$-shaped magnet with the help of a fine metallic suspension wire. The rectangular coil is made of enameled copper wire. It is wound on a frame of nonmagnetic material. The suspension wire $F$ is also used as one current lead to the coil. The other terminal of the coil is connected to a loosely wound spiral $E$ which serves as the second current lead. A soft iron cylinder D is placed inside the coil to make the field radial and stronger near the coil as shown in Fig. 14.16 (b).\nWhen a current is passed through the coil, it is acted upon by a couple which tends to rotate the coil. This couple is known as deflecting couple and is given by $N / B A \\cos \\alpha$. As the coil is placed in a radial magnetic field in which the plane of the coil is always parallel to the field (Fig. 14.16 b), so $\\alpha$ is always zero. This makes $\\cos \\alpha=1$ and thus,\n\n$$\n\\text { Deflecting couple }=N i B A\n$$\n\nAs the coil turns under the action of deflecting couple, the suspension wire Fig. (14.16 a) is twisted which gives rise to a torsional couple. It tends to untwist the suspension and restore the coil to its original position. This couple is known as restoring couple. The restoring couple of the suspension wire is proportional to the angle of deflection $\\theta$ as long as the suspension wire obeys Hooke's law. Thus\n\n$$\n\\text { Restoring torque }=c \\theta\n$$\n\nwhere the constant c of the suspension wire is known as torsional couple and is defined as couple for unit twist.\nUnder the effect of these two couples, coil comes to rest when Deflecting torque $=$ Restoring torque\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& N I B A=c \\theta \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\\\\n& 1=\\frac{c}{B A N} \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $\\quad 1 \\propto \\theta \\quad$ since $\\quad \\frac{c}{B A N}=$ Constant\nThus the current passing through the coil is directly proportional to the angle of deflection.\n\nThere are two methods commonly used for observing the angle of deflection of the coil. In sensitive galvanometers the angle of deflection is observed by means of small mirror attached to the coil along with a lamp and scale arrangement (Fig.14.17). A beam of light from the lamp is directed towards the mirror of the galvanometer. After reflection from the mirror it produces a spot on a translucent scale placed at a distance of one metre from the galvanometer. When the coil rotates, the mirror attached to coil also rotates and spot of light moves along the scale. The displacement of the spot of light on the scale is proportional to the angle of deflection (provided the angle of deflection is small).\nThe galvanometer used in school and college laboratories is a pivoted type galvanometer. In this type of galvanometer, the coil is pivoted between two jewelled bearings. The restoring torque is provided by two hair springs which also serve as current leads. A light aluminium pointer is attached to the coil which moves over a scale (Fig.14.18). It gives the angle of deflection of the coil.\nIt is obvious from Eq. 14.17 that a galvanometer can be made more sensitive (to give large deflection for a given current) if $\\mathrm{c} / B A N$ is made small. Thus, to increase sensitivity of a galvanometer, c may be decreased or $B, A$ and $N$ may be increased. The couple $c$ for unit twist of the suspension wire can be decreased by increasing its length and by decreasing its diameter. This process, however, cannot be taken too far, as the suspension must be strong enough to support the coil. Another method to increase the sensitivity of galvanometer is to increase N , the number of turns of the coil. In case of suspended coil type galvanometer, the number of turns can not be increased beyond a limit because it will make the coil heavy. To compensate for the loss of sensitivity, in case fewer turns are used in the coil, we increase the value of the magnetic field employed. We define current sensitivity of a galvanometer as the current, in microamperes, required to produce one millimetre deflection on a scale placed one metre away from the mirror of the galvanometer.\nWhen the current passing through the galvanometer is discontinued, the coil will not come to rest as soon as the current flowing through the coil is stopped. It keeps on oscillating about its mean position before coming to rest. In the same way if the current is established suddenly in a galvanometer, the coil will shoot beyond its final equilibrium position and will oscillate several times before coming to rest\nFig. 14.17\nFig. 14.18\n\nFig. 14.19 An ammeter is a galvanometer which is shunted by a proper low resistance.\nat its equilibrium position. As it is annoying and time consuming to wait for the coil to come to rest, artificial ways are employed to make the coil come to rest quickly. Such galvanometer in which the coil comes to rest quickly after the current passed through it or the current is stopped from flowing through it, is called stable or a dead beat galvanometer.\n\n## Ammeter\n\nAn ammeter is an electrical instrument which is used to measure current in amperes. This is basically a galvanometer. The portion of the galvanometer whose motion causes the needle of the device to move across the scale is usually known as meter - movement. Most meter movements are very sensitive and full scale deflection is obtained with a current of few milliamperes only. So an ordinary galvanometer cannot be used for measuring large currents without proper modification.\nSuppose we have a galvanometer whose meter - movement (coil) has a resistance $R_{s}$ and which gives full scale deflection when current $I_{n}$ is passed through it. From Ohm's law we know that the potential difference $V_{0}$ which causes a current $I_{0}$ to pass through the galvanometer is given by\n\n$$\nV_{0}=I_{0} R_{0}\n$$\n\nIf we want to convert this galvanometer into an ammeter which can measure a maximum current $I$, it is necessary to connect a low value bypass resistor called shunt. The shunt resistance is of such a value so that the current $I_{0}$ for full scale deflection of the galvanometer passes through the galvanometer and the remaining current $\\left(I-I_{0}\\right)$ passes through the shunt in this situation (Fig. 14.19).\nThe shunt resistance $R_{s}$ can be calculated from the fact that as the meter - movement and the shunt are connected in parallel with each other, the potential difference across the meter - movement is equal to the potential difference across the shunt.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I_{0} R_{0}=\\left(I-I_{0}\\right) R_{n} \\\\\n& R_{s}=\\frac{I_{0}}{I-I_{0}} R_{0}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe resistance of the shunt is usually so small that a piece of\n\ncopper wire serves the purpose. The resistance of the ammeter is the combined resistance of the galvanometer's meter - movement and the shunt. Usually it is very small. An ammeter must have a very low resistance so that it does not disturb the circuit in which it is connected in series in order to measure the current.\n\n# Voltmeter\n\nA voltmeter is an electrical device which measures the potential difference in volts between two points. This, too, is made by modifying a galvanometer. Since a voltmeter is always connected in parallel, it must have a very high resistance so that it will not short the circuit across which the voltage is to be measured. This is achieved by connecting a very high resistance $R_{h}$ placed in series with the meter movement (Fig.14.20). Suppose we have a meter movement whose resistance is $R_{g}$ and which deflects full scale with a current $I_{s}$. In order to make a voltmeter from it which has a range of $V$ volts, the value of the high resistance $R_{h}$ should be such that full scale deflection will be obtained when it is connected across $V$ volt. Under this condition the current through the meter - movement is $I_{s}$. Applying Ohm's law (Fig.14.20) we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& V=I_{s}\\left(R_{s}+R_{h}\\right) \\\\\n& R_{h}=\\frac{V}{I_{g}}-R_{g}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf the scale of the galvanometer is calibrated from 0 to $V$ volts, the combination of galvanometer and the series resistor acts as a voltmeter with range $0-V$ volts. By properly arranging the resistance $R_{h}$ any voltage can be measured. Thus, we see that a voltmeter possesses high resistance.\nIt may be noted that a voltmeter is always connected across the two points between which potential difference is to be measured. Before connecting a voltmeter, it should be assured that its resistance is very high in comparison with the resistance of the circuit across which it is connected otherwise it will load the circuit and will alter the potential difference which is required to be measured.\nExample 14.6: What shunt resistance must be connected across a galvanometer of $50.0 \\Omega$ resistance which gives full scale deflection with 2.0 mA current, so as to convert it into an ammeter of range 10.0A?\nFig. 14.20 A galvanometer in series with a high resistance acts as a voltmeter.\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFig. 14.21 A moving coil galvanometer is converted into an ohmmeter.\n\n## Solution:\n\nResistance of galvanometer $=R_{s}=50.0 \\Omega$\nCurrent for full scale deflection $=I_{0}=2.0 \\mathrm{~mA}$\nCurrent to be measured $\\quad=I=10.0 \\mathrm{~A}$\nThe shunt resistance $R_{s}$ is given by\n\n$$\nR_{s}=\\frac{I_{0}}{I-I_{0}} R_{p}=\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~A}}{10.0 \\mathrm{~A}-2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~A}} \\times 50.0 \\mathrm{~A}=0.01 \\Omega\n$$\n\n# Ohmmeter\n\nIt is a useful device for rapid measurement of resistance. It consists of a galvanometer, and adjustable resistance $r_{s}$ and a cell connected in series (Fig.14.21-a). The series resistance $r_{s}$ is so adjusted that when terminals $c$ and $d$ are short circuited, i.e., when $R=0$, the galvanometer gives full scale deflection. So the extreme graduation of the usual scale of the galvanometer is marked 0 for resistance measurement. When terminals $c$ and $d$ are not joined, no current passes through the galvanometer and its deflection is zero. Thus zero of the scale is marked as infinity (Fig. 14.21-b). Now a known resistance $R$ is connected across the terminals c and d . The galvanometer deflects to some intermediate point. This point is calibrated as R. In this way the whole scale is calibrated into resistance. The resistance to be measured is connected across the terminals c and d. The deflection on the calibrated scale reads the value of the resistance directly.\n\n### 14.11 AVO METER - MULTIMETER\n\nIt is an instrument which can measure current ir amperes, potential difference in volts and resistance ir ohms. It basically consists of a sensitive moving coi galvanometer which is converted into a multirange ammeter voltmeter or ohmmeter accordingly as a current measuring\n\ncircuit or a voltage measuring circuit or a resistance measuring circuit is connected with the galvanometer with the help of a switch known as function switch (Fig.14.22). Here $X, Y$ are the main terminals of the AVO meter which are connected with the circuit in which measurement is required. FS is the function selector switch which connects the galvanometer with relevant measuring circuit.\n\n# Voltage Measuring Part of AVO Meter\n\nThe voltage measuring part of the AVO meter is actually a multirange voltmeter. It consists of a number of resistances each of which can be connected in series with the moving coil galvanometer with the help of a switch called the range switch (Fig. 14.23). The value of each resistance depends upon the range of the voltmeter which it controls.\nAlternating voltages are also measured by AVO meter. AC voltage is first converted into DC voltage by using diode as rectifier and then measured as usual.\n\n## Current Measuring Part of AVO Meter\n\nThe current measuring part of the AVO meter is actually a multirange ammeter. It consists of a number of low resistances connected in parallel with the galvanometer. The values of these resistances depend upon the range of the ammeter (Fig. 14.24).\nThe circuit also has a range selection switch RS which is used to select a particular range of the current.\n\n## Resistance Measuring Part of AVO Meter\n\nThe resistance measuring part of AVO meter is, in fact, a multirange ohmmeter. Circuit for each range of this meter consists of a battery of emf $V_{s}$ and a variable resistance $r_{s}$ connected in series with galvanometer of resistance $R_{0}$. When the function switch is switched to position $X_{1}$ Fig. 14.22), this circuit is connected with the terminals $X, Y$ of he AVO meter (Fig. 14.25 a).\nBefore measuring an unknown resistance by an ohmmeter it s first zeroed which means that we short circuit the terminals $\\langle, Y$ and adjust $r_{s}$, to produce full scale deflection.\n\n## Digital Multimeter (DMM)\n\nAnother useful device to measure resistance, current and voltage is an electronic instrument called digital multimeter.\nFig. 14.23\nFig. 14.24\nFig. 14.25\n\nIt is a digital version of an AVO meter. It has become a very popular testing device because the digital values are displayed automatically with decimal point, polarity and the unit for $V, A$ or $\\Omega$. These meters are generally easier to use because they eliminate the human error that often occurs in reading the dial of an ordinary AVO meter. A portable DMM is shown in Fig. 14.26.\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nA magnetic field is set up in the region surrounding a current carrying conductor.\nThe right hand rule states, \"If the wire is grasped in the fist of right hand with the thumb pointing in the direction of current, the fingers of the hand will circle the wire in the direction of the magnetic field\".\nThe strength of the magnetic field or magnetic induction is the force acting on one metre length of the conductor placed at right angle to the magnetic field when 1 A current is passing through it.\nA magnetic field is said to have a strength of one tesla if it exerts a force of one newton on one metre length of the conductor placed at right angle to the field when a current of one ampere passes through the conductor.\nThe magnetic flux $\\Phi_{0}$ through plane element of area $\\mathbf{A}$ in a uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is given by dot product of $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{A}$.\nAmpere circuital law states the sum of the quantities B. $\\Delta \\mathbf{L}$ for all path elements into which the complete loop has been divided equals $\\mu_{0}$ times the total current enclosed by the loop.\nThe force experienced by a single charge carrier moving with velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ in magnetic field of strength $\\mathbf{B}$ is $\\mathbf{F}=q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$.\nCathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) is a high speed graph plotting device.

Understand and describe eddy currents and use of laminated core.\n\nAs soon as Oersted discovered that electric currents produce magnetic fields, many scientists began to look for the reverse effect, that is, to cause an electric current by means of a magnetic field. In 1831 Michael Faraday in England and at the same time Joseph Henry in USA observed that an emf is set up in a conductor when it moves across a magnetic field. If the moving conductor was connected to a sensitive galvanometer, it would show an electric current flowing through the circuit as long as the conductor is kept moving in the magnetic field. The emf produced in the conductor is called induced emf, and the current generated is called the induced current. This phenomenon is known as electromagnetic induction.\n\nFig. 15.1\n\n### 15.1 INDUCED EMF AND INDUCED CURRENT\n\nThere are many ways to produce induced emf. Fig. 15.1 illustrates one of them. Consider a straight piece of wire of length $\\ell$ placed in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. The wire is connected to a sensitive galvanometer. This forms a closed path or loop without any battery. In the beginning when the loop is at rest in the magnetic field, no current is shown by the galvanometer. If we move the loop from left to right, the length $\\ell$ of the wire is dragged across the magnetic field and a current flows through the loop. As we stop moving the loop, current also stops. Now, if we move the loop in opposite direction, current also reverses its direction. This is indicated by the deflection of the galvanometer in opposite direction.\nThe induced current depends upon the speed with which conductor moves and upon the resistance of the loop. If we change the resistance of the loop by inserting different resistors in the loop, and move it in the magnetic field with the same speed every time, we find that the product of induced current $I$ and the resistance $R$ of the loop remains constant, i.e.,\n\n$$\nI \\times R=\\text { constant }\n$$\n\nThis constant is the induced emf. The induced emf leads to an induced current when the circuit is closed. The current can be increased by\ni) using a stronger magnetic field\nii) moving the loop faster\niii) replacing the loop by a coil of many turns\n\nIf we perform the above experiment in the other way, i.e., instead of moving the loop across the magnetic field, we keep the loop stationary and move the magnet, then it can be easily observed that the results are the same. Thus, it can be concluded that it is the relative motion of the loop and the magnet that causes the induced emf.\nIn fact, this relative motion changes the magnetic flux through the loop, therefore, we can say that an induced emf is produced in a loop if the magnetic flux through it changes. The greater the rate of change of flux, the larger is the induced emf.\nThere are some other methods described below in which an emf is induced in a loop by producing a change of magnetic\n\nflux through it.\n\n1. Fig. 15.2 (a) shows a bar magnet and a coil of wire to which a galvanometer is connected. When there is no relative motion between the magnet and the coil, the galvanometer indicates no current in the circuit. As soon as the bar magnet is moved towards the coil, a current appears in it (Fig 15.2 b). As the magnet is moved, the magnetic flux through the coil changes, and this changing flux produces the induced current in the coil. When the magnet moves away from the coil, a current is again induced but now in opposite direction. The current would also be induced if the magnets were held stationary and the coil is moved.\n2. There is another method in which the current is induced in a coil by changing the area of the coil in a constant magnetic field. Fig. 15.3 (a) shows that no current is induced in the coil of constant area placed in a constant magnetic field. However, when the coil is being distorted so as to reduce its area, (Fig. 15.3 b) an induced emf and hence current appears. The current vanishes when the area is no longer changing. If the distorted coil is brought to its original circular shape thereby increasing the area, an oppositely directed current is induced which lasts as long as the area is changing.\nFig. 15.4\n3. An induced current can also be generated when a coil of constant area is rotated in a constant magnetic field. Here, also, the magnetic flux through the coil changes (Fig. 15.4). This is the basic principle used in electric generators.\n4. A very interesting method to induce current in a coil involves by producing a change of magnetic flux in\nFig. 15.3\n\nFig. 15.5\nFig. 15.6\na nearby coil. Fig. 15.5 shows two coils placed side by side. The coil $P$ is connected in series with a battery, a rheostat and a switch, while the other coil $S$ is connected to a galvanometer only. Since there is no battery in the coil S, one might expect that the current through it will always be zero. Now, if the switch of the coil $P$ is suddenly closed, a momentary current is induced in coil S. This is indicated by the galvanometer, which suddenly deflects and then returns to zero. No induced current exists in coil $S$ as long as the current flows steadily in the coil P. An oppositely directed current is induced in the coil $S$ at the instant the switch of coil $P$ is opened. Actually, the current in $P$ grows from zero to its maximum value just after the switch is closed. The current comes down to zero when the switch is opened. Due to change in current, the magnetic flux associated with the coil $P$ changes momentarily. This changing flux is also linked with the coil $S$ that causes the induced current in it. Current in coil $P$ can also be changed with the help of rheostat.\n5. It is also possible to link the changing magnetic flux with a coil by using an electromagnet instead of a permanent magnet. The coil is placed in the magnetic field of an electromagnet (Fig. 15.6). Both the coil and the electromagnet are stationary. The magnetic flux through the coil is changed by changing the current of the electromagnet, thus producing the induced current in the coil.\n\n### 15.2 MOTIONALEMF\n\nIn the previous section we have studied that when a conductor is moved across a magnetic field, an emf is induced between its ends. The emf of the moving conductor is similar to that of a battery, i.e., if the ends of the conductor are joined by a wire to make a closed circuit, a current flows through it.\n\nThe emf induced by the motion of a conductor across a magnetic field is called motional emf.\n\nConsider a conducting rod of length $L$ placed on two parallel metal rails separated by a distance $L$. A galvanometer is connected between the ends $c$ and $d$ of the rails. This forms a complete conducting loop abcda (Fig. 15.7a). A uniform\n\nmagnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is applied directed into the page. Initially when the rod is stationary, galvanometer indicates no current in the loop. If the rod is pulled to the right with constant velocity $v$, the galvanometer indicates a current flowing through the loop. Obviously, the current is induced due to the motion of the conducting rod across the magnetic field. The moving rod is acting as a source of emf $\\varepsilon=V_{b}-V_{a}=\\Delta V$.\nWhen the rod moves, a charge $q$ within the rod also moves with the same velocity $v$ in the magnetic field $B$ and experiences a force given by\n\n$$\nF=q v \\times B\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the force is\n\n$$\nF=q \\vee B \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nSince angle $\\theta$ between $v$ and $B$ is $90^{\\circ}$, so\n\n$$\nF=q v B\n$$\n\nApplying the right hand rule, we see that $F$ is directed from a to $b$ in the rod. As a result the charge migrates to the top end of the conductor. As more and more of the charges migrate, concentration of the charge is produced at the top $b$ and deficiency of charges at the bottom a. This redistribution of charge sets up an electrostatic field $E$ directed from $b$ to $a$. The electrostatic force on the charge is $F_{e}=q E$ directed from b to a. The system quickly reaches an equilibrium state in which these two forces on the charge are balanced. If $E_{0}$ is the electric intensity in this state then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nq E_{0} & =q v B \\\\\nE_{0} & =v B\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe motional emf $\\varepsilon$ will be equal to the potential difference $\\Delta V, \\Delta V=V_{b}-V_{a}$ between the two ends of the moving conductor in this equilibrium state. The gradient of potential will be given by $\\Delta V / L$. As the electric intensity is given by the negative of the gradient, therefore,\n\n$$\nE_{0}=-\\frac{\\Delta V}{L}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text { or } \\Delta V=-L E_{0}=-(L v B)\n$$\n\nThis heater operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction. The water in the metal pot is boiling whereas that in the glass pot is not. Even the glass top of the heater is cool to touch. The coil just beneath the top carries ac that produces changing magnetic flux. Flux linking with pots induce emf in them. Current is generated in the metal pot that heats up the water, but no current flows through the glass pan, why?\n\nThe motional emf\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=\\Delta V=-L V B\n$$\n\nThis is the magnitude of motional emf. However, if the angle between $v$ and $B$ is $\\theta$, then\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-v B L \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nDue to induced emf positive charges would flow along the path abcda, therefore the induced current is anticlockwise in the diagram. As the current flows the quantity of the charge at the top decreases so the electric intensity decreases but the magnetic force remains the same Hence the equilibrium is disturbed in favour of magnetic force. Thus as the charges. reach the end a of the conductor due to current flow, they are carried to the top end $b$ of the conductor by the unbalanced magnetic field and the current continues to flow.\n\nExample 15.1: A metal rod of length 25 cm is moving at a speed of $0.5 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ in a direction perpendicular to a 0.25 T magnetic field. Find the emf produced in the rod.\n\n## Solution:\n\nSpeed of rod $=V=0.5 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$\nLength of rod $=L=25 \\mathrm{~cm}=0.25 \\mathrm{~m}$\nMagnetic flux density $=B=0.25 \\mathrm{~T}=0.25 \\mathrm{NA}^{-1} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}$\nInduced emf $=\\varepsilon=$ ?\nUsing the relation,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon=\\text { VBL } \\\\\n& \\varepsilon=0.5 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\times 0.25 \\mathrm{NA}^{-1} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1} \\times 0.25 \\mathrm{~m} \\\\\n& \\varepsilon=3.13 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{JC}^{-1} 3.13 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### 15.3 FARADAY'S LAW AND INDUCED EMF\n\nThe motional emf induced in a rod moving perpendicular to a magnetic field is $\\varepsilon=-v B L$. The motional emf as well as other induced emfs can be described in terms of magnetic flux. Consider the experiment shown in Fig. 15.8 again. Let the conducting rod $L$ moves from position 1 to position 2 in a small interval of time $\\Delta t$. The distance travelled by the rod in time $\\Delta t$ is $x_{2}-x_{1}=\\Delta x$\n\nSince the rod is moving with constant velocity $v$, therefore\n\n$$\nv=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 15.3\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-v B L=-\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} B L\n$$\n\nAs the rod moves through the distance $\\Delta x$, the increase in the area of loop is given by $\\Delta A=\\Delta x . L$. This increases the flux through the loop by $\\Delta \\Phi=\\Delta A . B=\\Delta x . L . B$. Putting $\\Delta x . L . B=\\Delta \\Phi$ in Eq.15.6, we get\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-\\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nIf there is a coil of N loops instead of a single loop, then the induced emf will become $N$ times, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-N \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nAlthough the above expression is derived on the basis of motional emf, but it is true in general. This conclusion was first arrived at by Faraday, so this is known as Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction which states that\n\"The average emf induced in a conducting coil of $N$ loops is equal to the negative of the rate at which the magnetic flux through the coil is changing with time\".\n\n## A cooper ring passes through a rectangle region where a constant magnetic field is directed into the page. What do you guess about the current in the ring at the positions 2,3 and 4 ?\n\nThe minus sign indicates that the direction of the induced emf is such that it opposes the change in flux.\nExample 15.2: A loop of wire is placed in a uniform magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. The strength of the magnetic field is 0.6 T . The area of the loop begins to shrink at a constant rate of $\\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t}=0.8 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. What is the magnitude of emf induced in the loop while it is shrinking?\n\n# Solution:\n\nRate of change of area $=\\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t}=0.8 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.\nMagnetic flux density $=B=0.6 \\mathrm{~T}=0.6 \\mathrm{NA}^{-1} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}$\nNumber of turns $=\\mathrm{N}=1$\nInduced emf $=\\varepsilon=$ ?\nRate of change of flux $=\\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}=B \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t} \\cos 0^{\\circ}=B \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t}$\nApplying Faraday's Law, magnitude of induced emf\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\varepsilon & =\\mathrm{N} \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}=\\mathrm{N} B \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n& =1 \\times 0.6 \\mathrm{NA}^{-1} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1} \\times 0.8 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\\\\n\\varepsilon & =0.48 \\mathrm{JC}^{-1}=0.48 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### 15.4 LENZ'S LAW AND DIRECTION OF INDUCED EMF\n\nIn the previous section, a mathematical expression of the Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction was derived as\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=-\\mathrm{N} \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nThe minus sign in the expression is very important. It has to do with the direction of the induced emf. To determine the direction we use a method based on the discovery made by the Russian Physicist Heinrich Lenz in 1834. He found that the polarity of an induced emf always leads to an induced current that opposes, through the magnetic field of the induced current, the change inducing the emf. The rule is known as Lenz's law which states that\n\"The direction of the induced current is always so as to oppose the change which causes the current\".\n\nThe Lenz's law refers to induced currents and not to induced emf, which means that we can apply it directly to closed conducting loops or coils. However, if the loop is not closed we can imagine as if it were closed, and then from the direction of induced current, we can find the direction of the induced emf.\n\nLet us apply the Lenz's law to the coil in which current is induced by the movement of a bar magnet. We know that a current carrying coil produces a magnetic field similar to that of a bar magnet. One face of the coil acts as the north pole while the other one as the south pole. If the coil is to oppose the motion of the bar magnet, the face of the coil towards the magnet must become a north pole (Fig. 15.9). The two north poles will then repel each other. The right hand rule applied to\nthe coil suggests that the induced current must be anticlockwise as seen from the side of the bar magnet.\n\nAccording to Lenz's law the \"push' of the magnet is the \"change\" that produces the induced current, and the current acts to oppose the push. On the other hand if we pull the magnet away from the coil the induced current will oppose the \"pull\" by creating a south pole on the face of coil towards the bar magnet.\n\nThe Lenz's law is also a statement of law of conservation of energy that can be conveniently applied to the circuits involving induced currents. To understand this, consider once again the experiment in Fig. 15.8. When the rod moves towards right, emf is induced in it and an induced current flows through the loop in the anti-clockwise direction. Since the\n\nFig. 15.10\ncurrent carrying rod is moving in the magnetic field, it experiences a magnetic force $F_{\\text {m }}$ having the magnitude $F_{m}=I L B \\sin 90^{\\circ}$. By right hand rule the direction of $F_{m}$ is opposite to that of $v$, so it tends to stop the rod (Fig. 15.10 a). An external dragging force equal to $F_{m}$ in magnitude but opposite in direction must be applied to keep the rod moving with constant velocity. This dragging force provides the energy for the induced current to flow. This energy is the source of induced current, thus electromagnetic induction is exactly according to law of conservation of energy.\nThe Lenz's law forbids the induced current directed clockwise in this case, because the force $F_{\\text {. }}$ would be, then, in the direction of $v$ that would accelerate the rod towards right (Fig. 15.10 b). This in turn would induce a stronnci current, the magnetic field due to it also increases, (1) the magnetic force increases further. Thus the motion of the wire is accelerated more and more. Starting with a minute quantity of energy, we obtain an ever increasing kinetic energy of motion apparently from nowhere. Consequently the process becomes self-perpetuating which is against the law of conservation of energy.\n\n# 15.5 MUTUAL INDUCTION\n\nConsider two coils placed close to each other (Fig.15.11). One coil connected with a battery through a switch and a\nFig. 15.11\nrheostat is called the \"primary\" and the other one connected to the galvanometer is called the \"secondary\". If the current in the primary is changed by varying the resistance of the rheostat, the magnetic flux in the surrounding region\n\nchanges. Since the secondary coil is in the magnetic field of the primary, the changing flux also links with the secondary. This causes an induced emf in the secondary.\n\nThe phenomenon in which a changing current in one coil induces an emf in another coil is called the mutual induction.\n\nAccording to Faraday's law, the emf induced in the secondary coil is proportional to the rate of change of flux $\\frac{\\Delta \\Phi_{s}}{\\Delta t}$ passing through it, i.e., $\\quad \\varepsilon_{s}=-N_{s} \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi_{s}}{\\Delta t}$\nwhere $N_{s}$ is the number of turns in the secondary coil.\nLet the flux passing through one loop of the secondary coil be $\\Phi_{s}$. Net flux passing through the coil of $\\mathrm{N}_{s}$ loops is $\\mathrm{N}_{s} \\Phi_{s}$. As this flux is proportional to the magnetic field produced by the current $I_{p}$ in the primary and the magnetic field itself is proportional to $I_{p}$, therefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& N_{s} \\Phi_{s} \\propto I_{p} \\\\\n& N_{s} \\Phi_{s}=M I_{p}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhere $M=\\frac{N_{s} \\Phi_{s}}{I_{p}}$ is proportionality constant called the\nmutual inductance of the two coils. It depends upon the number of turns of the coils, their area of cross-section, their closeness together and the nature of the core material upon which the two coils are wound.\nBy Faraday's law the emf induced in the secondary coil is given by the rate of change of flux through the secondary.\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{s}=-N_{s} \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi_{s}}{\\Delta t}=-\\frac{\\Delta N \\Phi_{s}}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nPutting $\\mathrm{N}_{s} \\Phi_{s}=\\mathrm{M} I_{p}$ from Eq. 15.9\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon_{s}=-\\frac{\\Delta\\left(M I_{p}\\right)}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_{s}=-M \\frac{\\Delta I_{p}}{\\Delta t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe Eq.15.10 shows that the emf induced in the secondary is proportional to the time rate of change of current in the primary.\n\nThe negative sign in Eq. 15.10 indicates the fact that the induced emf is in such a direction that it opposes the change of current in the primary coil. While finding out the value of $M$ from Eq.15.10, negative sign is ignored. Thus $M$ may be defined as the ratio of average emf induced in the secondary to the time rate of change of current in the primary.\n\n$$\nM=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{p}} / \\Delta t}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit for the mutual inductance $M$ is Vs $\\mathrm{A}^{-1}$, which is called as henry $(\\mathrm{H})$ after Joseph Henry.\nOne henry is the mutual inductance of the pair of coils in which the rate of change of current of one ampere per second in the primary causes an induced emf of one volt in the secondary.\n\nExample 15.3: An emf of 5.6 V is induced in a coil while the current in a nearby coil is decreased from 100 A to 20 A in 0.02 s . What is the mutual inductance of the two coils?

In all the examples we have discussed so far, induced emf was produced by a changing magnetic flux from some external source. But the change of flux through a coil may also be due to a change of current in the coil itself.\nConsider the circuit shown in Fig. 15.12. A coil is connected in series with a battery and a rheostat. Magnetic flux is produced through the coil due to current in it. If the current is changed by varying the rheostat quickly, magnetic flux through the coil changes that causes an induced emf in the coil. Such an emf is called as self induced emf.\nFig. 15.12\n\n## The phenomenon in which a changing current in a coil induces an emf in itself is called self induction.\n\nIf the flux through one loop of the coil be $\\Phi$, then the total flux through the coil of $N$ turns would be $N \\Phi$. As $\\Phi$ is proportional to the magnetic field which is in turn proportional to the current $I$, therefore\n\n$$\nN \\Phi \\propto I\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nN \\Phi=L I\n$$\n\nwhere $L=\\frac{N \\Phi}{I}$ is the constant of proportionality called the self inductance of the coil. It depends upon the number of turns of the coil, its area of cross-section and the core material. By winding the coil around a ferromagnetic (iron) core, the magnetic flux and hence the inductance can be increased significantly relative to that for an air core.\nBy Faraday's Law, emf induced in the coil is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}=-\\mathrm{N} \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}=-\\frac{\\Delta(N \\Phi)}{\\Delta t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nPutting $N \\Phi=L I$ from Eq.15.11\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}=-\\frac{\\Delta(L I)}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}=-L \\frac{\\Delta I}{\\Delta t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe Eq. 15.12 shows that the self induced emf in a coil is proportional to the time rate of change of current in the coil. Self inductance $L$ of a coil may be defined as the ratio of the emf to the rate of change of current in the coil. The unit of $L$ is also henry $(\\mathrm{H})$.\n\nThe negative sign in Eq. 15.12 indicates that the self induced emf must oppose the change that produced it. That is why the self induced emf is sometimes called as back emf. This is exactly in accord with the Lenz's law. If the current is increased, the induced emf will be opposite to that of battery and if the current is decreased the induced emf will aid, rather than opposing the battery. Because of their self inductance, coils of wire are known as inductors, and are widely used in electronics. In alternating current, inductors behave like resistors.\nExample 15.4: The current in a coil of 1000 turns is changed from 5 A to zero in 0.2 s . If an average emf of 50 V is induced during this interval, what is the self inductance of the coil? What is the flux through each turn of the coil when a current of 6 A is flowing?\n\n# Solution:\n\n| Change in current | $=\\Delta I=5 \\mathrm{~A}-0=5 \\mathrm{~A}$ |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Time interval | $=\\Delta t=0.2 \\mathrm{~s}$ |\n| emf induced | $=\\varepsilon=50 \\mathrm{~V}$ |\n| Self induction | $=L=?$ |\n| Steady current | $=I=6 \\mathrm{~A}$ |\n| No. of turns of coil | $=N=1000$ |\n| Flux through each turn $=$ |  |\n\nUsing\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nL=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\Delta I / \\Delta t}=\\frac{50 \\mathrm{~V}}{5 \\mathrm{~A} / 0.2 \\mathrm{~s}}=\\frac{50 \\mathrm{~V}}{5 \\mathrm{~A} / 0.2 \\mathrm{~s}} \\\\\nL=2 \\mathrm{VsA}^{-1}=2 \\mathrm{H}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nNow, using Eq. 15.11\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nN \\Phi=L I \\text { or } \\Phi=\\frac{L I}{N} \\\\\n\\Phi=\\frac{2 \\mathrm{H} \\times 6 \\mathrm{~A}}{1000}=1.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~Wb}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n# 15.7 ENERGY STORED IN AN INDUCTOR\n\nWe have studied in chapter 12 that energy can be stored in the electric field between the plates of a capacitor. In a similar manner, energy can be stored in the magnetic field of an inductor.\nConsider a coil connected to a battery and a switch in series (Fig. 15.13). When the switch is turned on voltage $V$ is applied across tho ends of the coil and current through it rises from zero to its maximum value $I$. Due to change of current, an emf is induced, which is opposite to that of battery. Work is done by the battery to move charges against the induced emf.\nWork done by the battery in moving a small charge $\\Delta q$ is\n\n$$\nW=\\Delta q \\varepsilon_{L}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\varepsilon_{L}=$ is the magnitude of induced emf, given by\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{L}=L \\frac{\\Delta I}{\\Delta I}\n$$\n\nPutting the value of $\\varepsilon_{L}=$ in Eq. 15.13 we get\n\n$$\nW=\\Delta q \\cdot L \\frac{\\Delta I}{\\Delta I}=\\frac{\\Delta q}{\\Delta I} \\cdot L \\Delta I\n$$\n\nTotal work done in establishing the current from 0 to $I$ is found by inserting for $\\frac{\\Delta q}{\\Delta I}$, the average current, and the value of $\\Delta I$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Average current }=\\frac{\\Delta q}{\\Delta I}=\\left(\\frac{0+1}{2}\\right) I=\\frac{1}{2} I \\\\\n& \\text { Change in current }=\\Delta I=I-0=I \\\\\n& \\text { Total work } \\quad=W=\\left(\\frac{1}{2} I\\right) L I \\\\\n& W=\\frac{1}{2} L I^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis work is stored as potential energy in the inductor. Hence the energy stored in an inductor is\n\n$$\nU_{m}=\\frac{1}{2} L I^{2}\n$$\n\nAs in case of a capacitor, energy is stored in the electric field between the plates, likewise, in an inductor, energy is stored in the magnetic field. Therefore, Eq. 15.15 can be expressed in terms of the magnetic field $B$ of a solenoid which has $n$ turns per unit length and area of cross section A. The magnetic field strength inside it is $B=\\mu_{r} n /$. Since flux through the coil is\nFig. 15.13\n\nFor Your Information\nAn induction ammeter with its ironcore jaw (a) open and (b) closed around a wire carrying an alternating current $I$, some of the magnetic field lines that encircle the wire are routed through the coil by the iron core and lead to an induced emf.

What happens if a coil of wire is rotated in a magnetic field? Can a current be produced in the coil? Yes, it does. Such a device is called a current generator.\n\n## A current generator is a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n\nThe principle of an electric generator is based on Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. When a coil is rotated in a magnetic field by some mechanical means, magnetic flux through the coil changes, and consequently an emf is induced in the coil.\nIf the generator is connected to an external circuit, an electric current is the output of the generator.\nLet a rectangular loop of wire of area $A$ be placed in a uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ (Fig.15.14). The loop is rotated about z-axis through its centre at constant angular velocity $\\omega$. One end of the loop is attached to a metal ring $R$ and the other end to the ring $R^{\\prime}$. These rings, called the slip rings are concentric with the axis of the loop and rotate with it. Rings $R R^{\\prime}$ slide against stationary carbon brushes to which external circuit is connected.\nTo calculate the induced emf in the loop, consider its position (Fig.15.15) while it is rotating anticlockwise. The figure shows the top view of the coil. The vertical side ab of the loop is moving with velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ in the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. If the angle between $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ be $\\theta$, the motional emf induced in the side ab has the magnitude,\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ab}}=v B L \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\n(Front view)\nFig. 15.14\nFig. 15.15\n\nThe direction of induced current in the wire ab is the same as that of force $F$ experienced by the charges in the wire, i.e., from top to the bottom. The same amount of emf is induced in the side cd but the direction of current is from bottom to the top.\nTherefore\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ct}}=v B L \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nThe net contribution to emf by sides bc and da is zero because the force acting on the charges inside bc and da is not along the wire.\n\n$$\n\\text { Thus } \\quad \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{bc}}=\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{da}}=0\n$$\n\nSince both the emfs in the sides ab and cd drive current in the same direction around the loop, the total emf in the loop is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon=\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ab}}+\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{cd}} \\\\\n& \\varepsilon=v B L \\sin \\theta+v B L \\sin \\theta \\\\\n& \\varepsilon=2 v B L \\sin \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf the loop is replaced by a coil of N turns, the total emf in the coil will be,\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=2 N v B L \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nThe linear speed $v$ of the vertical wire is related to the angular speed $\\omega$ by the relation\n\n$$\nv=\\omega r\n$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the distance of the vertical wires from the centre of the coil. Substituting $\\omega r$ for $v$ in Eq. (15.21)\n\nWe get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon=2 \\mathrm{~N}(\\omega r) B L \\sin \\theta \\\\\n& \\varepsilon=N \\omega(2 r L) B \\sin \\theta \\\\\n& \\varepsilon=N \\omega A B \\sin \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $A=2 r L=$ area of the coil\nAs the angular displacement $\\theta=\\omega t$, so the Eq. 15.22 becomes\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=N \\omega A B \\sin (\\omega t)\n$$\n\nEq. 15.23 shows that the induced emf varies sinusoidally with time.\nIt has the maximum value $\\varepsilon_{n}$ when $\\sin (\\omega t)$ is equal to 1 . Thus\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{n}=N \\omega A B\n$$\n\nThe Eq. 15.23 can be written as,\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=\\varepsilon_{0} \\sin (\\omega t)\n$$\n\nIf $R$ is the resistance of the coil, then by Ohm's law, induced current in the coil will be\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{R}=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} \\sin (\\omega t)}{R}=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{R} \\sin (\\omega t)\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nI=I_{0} \\sin (\\omega t)\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{0}$ is maximum current.\nAngular speed $\\omega$ of the coil is related to its frequency of rotation $f$ as, $\\omega=2 \\pi f$\n\nThe Eqs. 15.25 and 15.26 can be written as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon=\\varepsilon_{0} \\sin (2 \\pi f t) \\\\\n& I=I_{0} \\sin (2 \\pi f t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEq. 15.28 indicates the variation of current as a function of $\\theta=2 \\pi f t$. Fig. 15.16 shows the graph for the current corresponding to different positions of one loop of the coil.\nWhen the angle between $\\mathbf{v} \\& \\mathbf{B}$ is $\\theta=0^{\\circ}$, the plane of the loop is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$, current is zero. As $\\theta$ increases, current also increases and at $\\theta=90^{\\circ}=\\pi / 2 \\mathrm{rad}$, the loop is parallel to B, current is maximum, directed along abcda. On further increase in $\\theta$ current decreases, and at $\\theta=180^{\\circ}=\\pi$ rad the current becomes zero as the loop is again perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$. For $180^{\\circ}<\\theta<270^{\\circ}$ current increases but reverses its direction as is clear from the figure. Current is now directed along dcbad. At $\\theta=270^{\\circ}=3 \\pi / 2 \\mathrm{rad}$, current is maximum in\n\nFor Your Information\nFaraday's homopolar generator with which he was able to produce a continuous induced current.\nthe reverse direction as the loop is parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$. At $\\theta=360^{\\circ}=2 \\pi$ rad, one rotation is completed, the loop is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$ and the current decreases to zero. After one rotation the cycle repeats itself. The current alternates in direction once in one cycle. Therefore, such a current is called the alternating current. It reverses its direction $f$ times per second.\n\nIn actual practice a number of coils are wound around an iron cylinder which is rotated in the magnetic field. This assembly is called an armature. The magnetic field is usually provided by an electromagnet. Armature is rotated by a fuel engine or a turbine run by a waterfall. In some commercial generators, field magnet is rotated around a stationary armature.\nExample 15.6: An alternating current generator operating at 50 Hz has a coil of 200 turns. The coil has an area of $120 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. What should be the magnetic field in which the coil rotates in order to produce an emf of maximum value of 240 volts?\n\n## Solution:\n\nFrequency of rotation $=f=50 \\mathrm{~Hz}$\nNo. of turns of the coil $=N=200$\nArea of the coil $=A=120 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}=1.2 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$\nMaximum emf $=\\varepsilon_{\\text {max }}=240 \\mathrm{~V}$\nMagnetic flux density $=B=$ ?\nFirst, we shall find the angular speed $\\omega$.\n\nUsing\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\omega=2 \\pi f \\\\\n& \\omega=2 \\times \\frac{22}{7} \\times 50=314.3 \\mathrm{rads}^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing $\\varepsilon_{n}=N \\omega A B$ or $B=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{\\mathrm{N} \\omega \\mathrm{A}}$\n\n$$\nB=\\frac{240 \\mathrm{~V}}{200 \\times 314.3 \\mathrm{rads}^{-1} \\times 1.2 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}^{2}}\n$$\n\n$B=0.32 \\mathrm{Vs} \\mathrm{rad}^{-1} \\mathrm{~m}^{2}=0.32 \\mathrm{~T}$\n\n### 15.9 D.C. GENERATOR\n\nAlternating current generators are not suitable for many applications, for example, to run a D.C. Motor. In 1834, William Sturgeon invented a simple device called a commutator that prevents the direction of current from\n\nchanging. Therefore a D.C. generator is similar to the A.C. generator in construction with the difference that \"slip rings\" are replaced by \"split rings\". The \"split rings\" are two halves of a ring that act as a commutator. Fig. 15.17 shows the \"split rings\" A and $A^{\\prime}$ attached to the two ends of the coil that rotates in the magnetic field. When the current in the coil is zero and is about to change direction, the split rings also change the contacts with the carbon brushes $B B^{\\prime}$. In this way the output from $B B^{\\prime}$ remains in the same direction, although the current is not constant in magnitude. The curve of the current is shown in Fig. 15.18. It is similar to a sine curve with the lower half inverted. The fluctuations of the output can be significantly reduced by using many coils rather than a single one. Multiple coils are wound around a cylindrical core to form the armature. Each coil is connected to a separate commutator and the output of every coil is tapped only as it reaches its peak emf. Thus the emf in the outer circuit is almost constant.\n\n### 15.10 BACK MOTOR EFFECT IN GENERATORS\n\nA generator is the source of electricity production. Practically, the generators are not so simple as described above. A large turbine is turned by high pressure steam or waterfall. The shaft of the turbine is attached to the coil which rotates in a magnetic field. It converts the mechanical energy of the driven turbine to electrical energy. The generator supplies current to the external circuit. The devices in the circuit that consume electrical energy are known as the \"load\". The greater the load the larger the current is supplied by the generator. When the circuit is open, the generator does not supply electrical energy, and a very little force is needed to rotate the coil. As soon as the circuit is closed, a current is drawn through the coil. The magnetic field exerts force on the current carrying coil. Fig. 15.19 shows the forces acting on the coil. Force $F_{1}$ is acting on the left side of the coil whereas an equal but opposite force $F_{2}$ acts on the right side of the coil. These forces are such that they produce a counter torque that opposes the rotational motion of the coil. This effect is sometimes referred to as back motor effect in the generators. The larger the current drawn, the greater is the counter torque produced. That means more mechanical energy is required to keep the coil rotating with constant angular speed. This is in agreement with the law of conservation of energy. The\nFig. 15.17\nFig. 15.18\n(a) Front view\n(b) Top view\n\nFig. 15.19\n\nFig. 15.20\nenergy consumed by the \"load\" must come from the \"energy source\" used to drive the turbine.\n\n# 15.11 D.C. MOTOR\n\nA motor is a device which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. We already know that a wire carrying current placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. This is the basic principle of an electric motor. In construction a D.C motor is similar to a D.C generator, having a magnetic field, a commutator and an armature. In the generator, the armature is rotated in the magnetic field and current is the output. In the D.C motor, current passes through the armature that rotates in the magnetic field. In the D.C motor, the brushes are connected to a D.C supply or battery (Fig.15.20). When current flows through the armature coil, the force on the conductors produces a torque, that rotates the armature. The amount of this torque depends upon the current, the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the coil and the number of turns of the coil.\nIf the current in the coil were all the time in the same direction, the torque on it would be reversed after each half revolution. But at this moment, commutator reverses the direction of current that keeps the torque always in the same sense. A little problem arises due to the use of commutator, that is, the torque vanishes each time the current changes its direction. This creates jerks in the smooth running of the armature. However the problem is overcome by using more than one coil wrapped around a soft-iron core. This results in producing a more steady torque.\nThe magnetic field in the motor, is provided by a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. The windings of the electromagnet are usually called the field coils. The field coils may be in series or in parallel to the armature coils.\n\n### 15.12 BACK EMF EFFECT IN MOTORS\n\nA motor is just like a generator running in reverse. When the coil of the motor rotates across the magnetic field by the applied potential difference $V$, an emf $\\varepsilon$ is induced in it. The induced emf is in such a direction that opposes the emf running the motor. Due to this reason the induced emf is called back emf of the motor. The magnitude of the back emf increases with the speed of motor.\nSince $V$ and $\\varepsilon$ are opposite in polarity, the net emf in the circuit is $V-\\varepsilon$. If $R$ is the resistance of the coil and / the current drawn\n\nby the motor, then by Ohm's law\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{V-\\varepsilon}{R} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad V=\\varepsilon+I R\n$$\n\nWhen the motor is just started, back emf is almost zero and hence a large current passes through the coil. As the motor speeds up, the back emf increases and the current becomes smaller and smaller. However, the current is sufficient to provide torque on the coil to drive the load and to overcome losses due to friction. If the motor is overloaded, it slows down. Consequently, the back emf decreases and allows the motor to draw more current. If the motor is overloaded beyond its limits, the current could be so high that it may burn out the motor.\n\nExample 15.7: A permanent magnet D.C motor is run by a battery of 24 volts. The coil of the motor has a resistance of 2 ohms. It develops a back emf of 22.5 volts when driving the load at normal speed. What is the current when motor just starts up? Also find the current when motor is running at normal speed.\n\n# Solution:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Operation Voltage } & =V=24 \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\n\\text { Resistance of the coil } & =R=2 \\Omega \\\\\n\\text { Backemf } & =\\varepsilon=22.5 \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\n\\text { Current } & =I=\\text { ? }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\ni) when motor just starts up, the back emf $\\varepsilon=0$\n\nUsing\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nV=\\varepsilon+1 R \\\\\n24 \\mathrm{~V}=0+1 \\times 2 \\Omega \\\\\nI=\\frac{24 \\mathrm{~V}}{2 \\Omega}=12 \\mathrm{~V} \\Omega^{1}=12 \\mathrm{~A}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhen motor runs at normal speed, $\\varepsilon=22.5 \\mathrm{~V}$\nthen using\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nV=\\varepsilon+1 R \\\\\nV=22.5 \\mathrm{~V}+1 \\times 2 \\Omega \\\\\nI=\\frac{24 \\mathrm{~V}-22.5 \\mathrm{~V}}{2 \\Omega}=0.75 \\mathrm{~V} \\Omega^{-1}=0.75 \\mathrm{~A}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n### 15.13 TRANSFORMER\n\nA transformer is an electrical device used to change a given alternating emf into a larger or smaller alternating emf. It\n\nworks on the principle of mutual induction between two coils.\nIn principle, the transformer consists of two coils of copper, electrically insulated from each other, wound on the same iron core. The coil to which A.C power is supplied is called primary and that from which power is delivered to the circuit is called the secondary.\n\nIt should be noted that there is no electrical connection between the two coils but they are magnetically linked. Suppose that an alternating emf is applied to the primary. If at some instant $t$ the flux in the primary is changing at the rate of $\\Delta \\Phi / \\Delta t$ then there will be back emf induced in the primary which will oppose the applied voltage. The instantaneous value of the self induced emf is given by\n\n$$\n\\text { Self induced emf }=-N_{p}\\left[\\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}\\right]\n$$\n\nIf the resistance of the coil is negligible then the back emf is equal and opposite to applied voltage $V_{p}$.\n\n$$\nV_{p}=-\\text { back emf }=N_{p}\\left[\\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $N_{p}$ is the number of turns in the primary.\nAssuming the flux through the primary also passes through the secondary, i.e., the two coils are tightly coupled, the rate of change of flux in the secondary will also be $\\Delta \\Phi / \\Delta t$ and the magnitude of the induced emf across the secondary is given by\n\n$$\nV_{s}=N_{s}\\left[\\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $N_{s}$ is the number of turns in the secondary\nDividing Eq. 15.31 by Eq.15.30, we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{s}}{V_{p}}=\\frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}}\n$$\n\nIf $N_{s}>N_{p}$ then according to Eq. 15.32, $V_{s}>V_{p}$, such a transformer in which voltage across secondary is greater than the primary voltage is called a step up transformer (Fig. 15.20 a). Similarly if $N_{s}<N_{p}$, i.e., the number of turns in the secondary is less than the number in primary, then $V_{s}<V_{p}$, such transformer in which voltage across secondary is less than the primary voltage is called a step down transformer (Fig. 15.20 b).\n\nIt is important to note that the electrical power in a transformer is transformed from its primary to the secondary coil by means of changing flux. For an ideal case the power inpôt to the primary is nearly equal to the power output from the secondary i.e.,\n$I_{p}$ is the current in the primary and $I_{n}$ in the secondary. The currents are thus inversely proportional to the respective voltages. Therefore, in a step up transformer when the voltage across the secondary is raised, the value of current is reduced. This is the principle behind its use in the electric supply network where transformer increases the voltage and reduces the current so that it can be transmitted over long distances without much power loss. When current $I$ passes through a resistance $R$, the power loss due to heating effect is $I^{\\prime} R$. Suppose $R$ is the resistance of transmission line. In order to minimize the loss during transmission, it is not possible to reduce $R$ because it requires the use of thick copper wire which becomes highly uneconomical. The purpose is well served by reducing $I$. At the generating power station the voltage is stepped up to several thousand of volts and power is transmitted at low current to long distances without much loss. Step down transformers then decrease the voltage to a safe value at the end of line where the consumer of electric power is located. Inside a house a transformer may be used to step down the voltage from 250 volts to 9 volts for ringing bell or operating a transistor radio. Transformers with several secondaries are used in television and radio receivers where several different voltages are required.\nOnly in an ideal transformer the output power is nearly equal to the input power. But in an actual transformer, this in not the case. The output is always less than input due to power losses. There are two main causes of power loss, namelyeddy currents and magnetic hysteresis.\nIn order to enhance the magnetic flux, the primary and secondary coils of the transformer are wound on soft iron core. The flux generated by the coils also passes through the core. As magnetic flux changes through a solid conductor, induced currents are set up in closed paths in the body of the\nconductor. These induced currents are set up in a direction perpendicular to the flux and are known as eddy currents. It results in power dissipation and heating of the core material. In order to minimize the power loss due to flow of these currents, the core is laminated with insulation in between the layers of laminations which stops the flow of eddy currents (Fig. 15.21). Hysterises loss is the energy expended to magnetize and demagnetize the core material in each cycle of theA.C.\n\nDue to these power losses, a transformer is far from being an ideal. Its output power is always less than its input power. The efficiency of a transformer is defined as\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{\\text { output power }}{\\text { input power }} \\times 100\n$$\n\nIn order to improve the efficiency, care should be exercised, to minimize all the power losses. For example core should be assembled from the laminated sheets of a material whose hysteresis loop area is very small. The insulation between lamination sheets should be perfect so as to stop the flow of eddy currents. The resistance of the primary and secondary coils should be kept to a minimum. As power transfer from primary to secondary takes place through flux linkages, so the primary and secondary coils should be wound in such a way that flux coupling between them is maximum.\n\nExample 15.8: The turns ratios of a step up transformer is 50. A current of 20 A is passed through its primary coil at 220 volts. Obtain the value of the voltage and current in the secondary coil assuming the transformer to be ideal one.\n\n# Solution:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{B}}}{N_{\\mathrm{p}}}=50 \\quad, \\quad I_{\\mathrm{c}}=20 \\mathrm{~A} \\\\\n& V_{\\mathrm{c}}=220 \\mathrm{~V} \\quad V_{\\mathrm{s}}=? \\quad I_{\\mathrm{s}}=?\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing the equation $\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{s}}}{V_{\\mathrm{p}}}=\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{p}}}{I_{\\mathrm{s}}}$ we get $\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{s}}}{220}=50$\nVoltage in the secondary coil $=V_{\\mathrm{s}}=220 \\times 50=1100$ volts\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{c}}}{V_{\\mathrm{s}}} \\times I_{\\mathrm{p}}=\\frac{1}{50} \\times 20=0.4 \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nAn emf is set up in a conductor when it moves across a magnetic field.

          "title": "ALTERNATING CURRENT\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nAt the end of this chapter the students will be able to:\n\n1. Understand and describe time period, frequency, the peak and root mean square values of an alternating current and voltage.\n2. Know and use the relationship for the sinusoidal wave.\n3.

Describe the three phase A.C. supply.\n11. Become familiar with electromagnetic spectrum (ranging from radio waves to $\\gamma$ rays).\n12. Know the production, transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves.\n\nWe have read in the last chapter that an A.C. generator produces alternating voltage/current. Now a days most of the electrical energy is produced by A.C. generators using water power or huge steam turbines. The main reason for the world wide use of A.C. is that it can be transmitted to long distances easily and at a very low cost.\n\n### 16.1 ALTERNATING CURRENT\n\nAlternating current (A.C.) is that which is produced by a voltage source whose polarity keeps on reversing with time (Fig.16.1 a,b). In Fig.16.1 (a), the terminal A of the source is positive with respect to terminal $B$ and it remains so during a time interval 0 to $T / 2$. At $t=T / 2$, the terminals change their polarity. Now A becomes negative with respect to B (Fig.16.1 b). This state continues during the time interval $T / 2$ to $T$, after which terminal $A$ again becomes positive with respect to $B$ and the next cycle starts. As a result of this change of polarity, the direction of the current flow in the circuit also changes. During the time $0-T / 2$, it flows in one direction and during the interval $T / 2-T$ in opposite direction (Fig.16.1 a,b). This time interval $T$\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFig. 16.1\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFig. 16.2\nduring which the voltage source changes its polarity once is known as period $T$ of the alternating current or voltage. Thus the frequency of alternating current or voltage is given as\n\n$$\nf=\\frac{1}{T}\n$$\n\nThe most common source of alternating voltage is an A.C. generator which has been described in the previous chapter. The output $V$ of this A.C. generator at any instant is given by\n\n$$\nV=V_{0} \\sin \\left[\\frac{2 \\pi}{T} \\times t\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $T$ is period of the rotation of coil and is equal to the period of A.C. and $\\frac{2 \\pi}{T}=2 \\pi f=\\omega$ is angular frequency of rotation of the coil. Thus $\\frac{2 \\pi}{T} \\times t=\\omega t$ is the angle through which the coil rotate in time $t$. Eq. 16.2 shows how its value changes with time $t$.\nAt time $t=0, \\theta=\\frac{2 \\pi}{T} \\times t$ is 0 and $V$ is zero. At $t=T / 4$ $\\theta=\\frac{2 \\pi}{T} \\times \\frac{T}{4}=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $V$ attains its maximum value $V_{0}$ at that instant. At $t=T / 2, \\theta=\\pi$ and $V$ is zero. At this instant $V$. changes its polarity and becomes negative. Henceforth, When $t=\\frac{3 T}{4}, \\theta=\\frac{3 \\pi}{2}$ and $V=-V_{0}$ and finally at the end of the cycle when $t=T, \\theta=2 \\pi$ and again $V=0$. The variation of $V$. with time $t$ and $\\theta$ is shown in Fig. 16.2 (a,b). This graph between voltage and time is known as waveform of alternating voltage. It can be seen that it is a sine curve. Thus the output voltage of an A.C. generator varies sinusoidally with time. In our daily life we are mostly dealing with this type of voltage, so we will consider it in detail.\n\n## 1. Instantaneous value\n\nThe value of voltage or current that exists in a circuit at any instant of time $t$ measured from some reference point is known as its instantaneous value. It can have any value between plus maximum value $+V_{0}$ and negative maximum\n\nvalue - Vo and is denoted by $V$. The entire waveform shown in Fig. 16.2 is actually a set of all the instantaneous values that exist during a period $T$. Mathematically, it is given by $V=V_{0} \\sin \\theta=V_{0} \\sin \\omega t$\n\n$$\nV=V_{0} \\sin \\frac{2 \\pi}{T} \\times t=V_{0} \\sin 2 \\pi f t\n$$\n\n# 2. Peak value\n\nIt is the maximum value reached by the voltage or current in one cycle. For example, voltage shown in Fig. 16.2 has a peak value of $V_{0}$.\n\n## 3. Peak to Peak Value\n\nIt is the sum of the positive and negative peak values usually written as p-p.value. The p-p value of the voltage waveform shown in Fig. 16.2 is $2 V_{0}$.\n\n## 4. Post Mean Square (rms) Value\n\nIf we connect an ordinary D.C. ammeter to measure alternating current, it would measure its value as averaged over a cycle. It can be seen in Fig. 16.2 that the average value of current and voltage over a cycle is zero, but the power delivered during a cycle is not zero because power is $I^{2} R$ and the values of $I^{2}$ are positive even for negative values of $I$. Thus the average value of $I^{2}$ is not zero and is called the mean square current. The alternating current or voltage is actually measured by square root of its mean square value known as root mean square (rms) value.\nLet us compute the average value of $V^{2}$ over a cycle. Fig. 16.3 shows an alternating voltage and the way its $V^{2}$ values vary. Note that the values of $V^{2}$ are positive on the negative half cycle also. As the graph of $V^{2}$ is symmetrical about the line $\\frac{1}{2} V_{0}^{2}$, so for this figure the mean or the average value of $V^{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{2} V_{0}^{2}$. The root mean square value of $V$ is obtained by taking\n\nthe square root of $V_{0}^{2} / 2$ Therefore,\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{rms}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{V_{0}^{2}}{2}}=\\frac{V_{0}}{\\sqrt{2}}=0.7 V_{0}\n$$\n\nSimilarly\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{rms}}=\\frac{I_{0}}{\\sqrt{2}}=0.7 I_{0}\n$$\n\nMost of the alternating current and voltage meters are calibrated to read rms values. When we speak of A.C. meter reading, we usually mean rms values unless stated otherwise.\n\nExample 16.1 : An A.C. voltmeter reads 250 V . What is its peak and instantaneous values if the frequency of alternating voltage is 50 Hz ?\n\n# Solution:\n\nrms value of alternating voltage $=V_{\\text {rms }}=250 \\mathrm{~V}$\nIts peak value $V_{0}$ is given by the relation\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{rms}}=\\frac{V_{0}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nV_{0}=\\sqrt{2} V_{\\mathrm{rms}}=\\sqrt{2} \\times 250 \\mathrm{~V}=353.5 \\mathrm{~V}\n$$\n\nAngular frequency $\\omega=2 \\pi f$\n\n$$\n=2 \\times \\pi \\times 50 \\mathrm{~Hz}=100 \\pi \\mathrm{~Hz}\n$$\n\nTherefore, instantaneous value is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV & =V_{0} \\sin \\omega t \\\\\n& =353.5 \\sin (100 \\pi t) \\mathrm{V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## Phase of A.C.\n\nWe have seen that the instantaneous value of the alternating voltage is given by\n\n$$\nV=V_{0} \\sin \\omega t\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nV=V_{0} \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nThis angle $\\theta$ which specifies the instantaneous value of the alternating voltage or current is known as its phase. In Fig. 16.2 (b), we can say that the phase at the points $A, B, C, D$ and $E$ is $0, \\pi / 2, \\pi, 3 \\pi / 2$ and $2 \\pi$ respectively because these angles are the values of $\\theta$ at these points. Thus each point on the A.C. waveform corresponds to a certain phase.\n\nThe phase at the positive peak is $\\pi / 2=90^{\\circ}$ and it is $3 \\pi / 2=270^{\\circ}$ at the negative peak. The points where the waveform crosses the time axis correspond to phase 0 and $\\pi$.\n\n# Phase Lag and Phase Lead\n\nIn practice, the phase difference between two alternating quantities is more important than their absolute phases. Fig. 16.4 shows two waveforms 1 and 2. The phase angles of the waveform 1 at the points $A, B, C, D$ and $E$ have been shown above the axis and those of waveform 2 below the axis. At the point $B$, the phase of 1 is $\\pi / 2$ and that of 2 is 0 . Similarly it can be seen that at each point the phase of waveform 2 is less than the phase of waveform 1 by an angle of $\\pi / 2$. We say that A.C. 2 is lagging behind A.C. 1 by an angle of $\\pi / 2$. It means that at each instant, the phase of A.C. 2 is less than the phase of A.C. 1 by $\\pi / 2$. Similarly it can be seen in Fig. 16.5, that the phase at each point of the waveform of A.C. 2 is greater than that of waveform 1 by an angle $\\pi / 2$. In this case, it is said that A.C. 2 is leading the A.C. 1 by $\\pi / 2$. It means that at each instant of time, the phase of A.C. 2 is greater than that of 1 by $\\pi / 2$.\nPhase lead and lag between two alternating quantities is conveniently shown by representing the two A.C. quantities as vectors.\n\n## Vector Representation of an Alternating Quantity\n\nA sinusoidally alternating voltage or current can be graphically represented by a counter clockwise rotating vector provided it satisfies the following conditions.\n\n1. Its length on a certain scale represents the peak or rms value of the alternating quantity.\n2. It is in the horizontal position at the instant when the alternating quantity is zero and is increasing positively.\n3. The angular frequency of the rotating vector is the same as the angular frequency $\\omega$ of the alternating quantity.\nFig. 16.6 (a) shows a sinusoidal voltage waveform leading an alternating current waveform by $\\pi / 2$. The same fact has been shown vectorially in Fig.16.6 (b). Here vector OI represents the peak or rms value of the current which is taken as the reference quantity. Similarly OV represents the rms or peak value of the alternating voltage which is leading the current by $90^{\\circ}$. Both vectors are supposed to be rotating in the counter\nFig. 16.4\nFig. 16.5\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFig. 16.6\n\nclockwise direction at the angular frequency $\\omega$ of the two alternating quantities. Fig. 16.6 (b) shows the position of voltage and current vector at $t=0$.\n\n# 16.2 A.C. CIRCUITS\n\nThe basic circuit element in a D.C. circuit is a resistor (R) which controls the current or voltage and the relationship between them is given by Ohm's law that is $V=I R$.\n\nIn A.C. circuits, in addition to resistor $R$, two new circuit elements namely INDUCTOR ( $L$ ), and CAPACITOR (C) become relevant. The current and voltages in A.C. circuits are controlled by three elements $R, L$ and $C$. We would study the response of an A.C. circuit when it is excited by an alternating voltage.\n\n### 16.3 A.C. THROUGH A RESISTOR\n\nFig. 16.7 (a) shows a resistor of resistance $R$ connected with an alternating voltage source.\nAt any time $t$ the potential difference across the terminals of the resistor is given by\n\n$$\nV=V_{0} \\sin \\omega t\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{0}$ is the peak value of the alternating voltage. The current $/$ flowing through the circuit is given by Ohm's law\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& i=\\frac{V}{R}=\\frac{V_{0}}{R} \\sin \\omega t \\\\\n& i=I_{0} \\sin \\omega t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\nwhere $i$ is the instantaneous current and $I_{0}=\\frac{V_{0}}{R}$ is the\npeak value of the current. It follows from Eqs. 16.5 and 16.6 that the instantaneous values of both voltage and current are sine functions which vary with time (Fig.16.7b). This figure shows that when voltage rises, the current also rises. If the voltage falls, the current also does so - both pass their maximum and minimum values at the same instant. Thus in a purely resistive A.C. circuit, instantaneous values of voltage and current are in phase. This behaviour is shown graphically in Fig. 16.7 (b) and vectorially in Fig. 16.7 (c).\nFig. 16.7 (c) shows $V$ and $I$ vectors for resistance. They are drawn parallel because there is no phase difference between them. The opposition to A.C. which the circuit\n\npresents is the resistance\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{V}{I}\n$$\n\nThe instantaneous power in the resistance is given by\n\n$$\nP=I^{2} R=V I=V^{2} / R\n$$\n\n$P$ is in watts, $V$ is in volts, $I$ is in amperes and $R$ is in ohms. It is very important to note that the Eq. 16.8 holds only when the current and voltage are in phase.\n\n# 16.4 A.C. THROUGH A CAPACITOR\n\nAlternating current can flow through a resistor, but it is not obvious that how it can flow through a capacitor. This can be demonstrated by the circuit shown in Fig.16.8. A low power bulb is connected in series with a $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ capacitor to supply mains through a switch. When the switch is closed, the bulb lights up showing that the current is flowing through the capacitor. Direct current cannot flow through a capacitor continuously because of the presence of an insulating medium between the plates of the capacitor. Now let us see how does A.C. flows through a capacitor. The current flows because the capacitor plates are continuously charged, discharged and charged the other way round by the alternating voltage (Fig. 16.9 a). The basic relation between the charge $q$ on a capacitor and the voltage $V$ across its plates i.e. $q=C V$ holds at every instant. If $V=V_{0} \\sin \\omega t$ is the applied alternating voltage, the charge on the capacitor at any instant will be given by\n\n$$\nq=C V=C V_{0} \\sin \\omega t\n$$\n\nFig. 16.8\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFig. 16.9\n\nReferring to the Fig. 16.2 (b) it can be seen that the phase at $O$ is zero and the phase at the upper maximum is $\\pi / 2$. So in Fig. 16.9 (b) the phase of $V$ at $O$ is zero but the current at this point is maximum so its phase is $\\pi / 2$. Thus, the current is leading the applied voltage by $90^{\\circ}$ or $\\pi / 2$. Now consider the points $A$ and $N$. The phase of alternating voltage at $A$ is $\\pi / 2$ but the phase of current at $N$ is $\\pi$. Again the current is leading the voltage by $90^{\\circ}$ or $\\pi / 2$. Similarly by comparing the phase at the pair of points ( $B, R),(C, S)$ and $(D, T)$ it can be seen that at all these points the current leads the voltage by $90^{\\circ}$ or $\\pi / 2$. This is vectorially represented in Fig. 16.9 (c).\nReactance of a capacitor is a measure of the opposition offered by the capacitor to the flow of A.C. It is usually represented by $X_{\\mathrm{C}}$. Its value is given by\n\n$$\nX_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{me}}}{I_{\\mathrm{me}}}\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{\\text {me }}$ is the rms value of the alternating voltage across the capacitor and $I_{\\text {me }}$ is the rms value of current passing through the capacitor. The unit of reactance is ohm. In case of capacitor\n\n$$\nX_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi f C}=\\frac{1}{\\omega C}\n$$\n\nAccording to Eq.16.11, a certain capacitor will have a large reactance at low frequency. So the magnitude of the opposition offered by it will be large and the current in the circuit will be small. On the other hand at high frequency, the reactance will be low and the high frequency current through the same capacitor will be large.\nExample 16.2: A $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~F}$ capacitor is connected to an alternating voltage of 24 V and frequency 50 Hz . Calculate\n(a) The reactance of the capacitor, and\n(b) The current in the circuit\n\n# Solution:\n\n(a) Reactance of the capacitor $X_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi f C}$\n\n$$\n=\\frac{1}{2 \\times 3.14 \\times 50 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\times 100 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~F}}\n$$\n\n$$\nX_{\\mathrm{C}}=31.8 \\frac{\\mathrm{~V}}{\\mathrm{Cs}}=31.8 \\Omega\n$$\n\n(b) From the equation $X_{C}=\\frac{V_{\\text {ma }}}{I_{\\text {ma }}}$\nor\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{ma}}=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ma}}}{X_{\\mathrm{C}}} \\frac{24 \\mathrm{~V}}{31.8 \\Omega}=0.75 \\mathrm{~A}\n$$\n\n# 16.5 A.C. THROUGH AN INDUCTOR\n\nAn inductor is usually in the form of a coil or a solenoid wound from a thick wire so that it has a large value of self inductance and has a negligible resistance. We have already seen how self inductance opposes changes of current. So when an alternating source of voltage is applied across an inductor, it must oppose the flow of A.C. which is continuously changing (Fig. 16.10). Let us assume that the resistance of the coil is negligible. We can simplify the theory by considering first, the current and then finding the potential difference across the inductor which will cause this current. Suppose the current is . $I=I_{0} \\sin 2 \\pi f t$. If $L$ is the inductance of the coil, the changing current sets up a back emf in the coil of magnitude\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{L}=L \\frac{\\Delta I}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nTo maintain the current, the applied voltage must be equal to the back e.m.f. The applied voltage across the coil must, therefore, be equal to\n\n$$\nV=L \\frac{\\Delta I}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nSince $L$ is a constant, $V$ is proportional to $\\frac{\\Delta I}{\\Delta t}$. Fig. 16.10 (b) shows how the current $I$ varies with time. The value of $\\Delta / / \\Delta t$ is given by the slope of the $I-t$ curve at the various instants of time. At $O$, the value of the slope is maximum, so the maximum value of $V$ equal to $V_{0}$ occurs at $O$ and is represented by OP (Fig. 16.10 b). From $O$ to $A$ the slope of $I-t$ graph decreases to zero so the voltage decreases form $V_{0}$ to zero at Q. From A to B, the slope of the $I-t$ graph is negative, so the voltage curve goes from $Q$ to $R$. In this way the voltage is represented by the curve PQRST corresponding to current curve OABCD. By comparing the phases of the pair of points $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{P}),(\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{Q}),(\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{R}),(\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{S})$ and $(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{T})$, it can be seen that the phase of the current is always less than the phase of voltage by $90^{\\circ}$ or $\\pi / 2$ i.e., current lags behind the applied voltage by $90^{\\circ}$ or $\\pi / 2$ or the applied voltage leads the current by $90^{\\circ}$ or $\\pi / 2$.\nInductors are made in many sizes to perform a wide variety of functions in business and industry.\n\nThis is vectorially shown in Fig. 16.10(c) Inductive reactance is a measure of the opposition offered by the inductance coil to the flow ofA.C. It is usually denoted by $X_{L}$.\n\n$$\nX_{L}=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{I_{\\mathrm{rms}}}\n$$\n\nIf $V_{\\text {rms }}$ is rms value of the alternating voltage across an inductance and $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, the rms value of the current passing through it, the value of $X_{L}$ is given by\n\n$$\nX_{L}=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{I_{\\mathrm{rms}}}=2 \\pi f L=\\omega L\n$$\n\nThe reactance of a coil, therefore, depends upon the frequency of the A.C. and the inductance $L$. It is directly proportional to both $f$ and $L . L$ is expressed in henry, $f$ in hertz, and $X_{L}$ in ohms. It is to be noted that inductance and capacitance behave oppositely as a function of frequency. If $f$ is low $X_{L}$ is small but $X_{C}$ is large. For high $f, X_{L}$ is large but $X_{C}$ is small. The behaviour of resistance is independent of frequency.\nReferring to Fig.16.10 (b), it can be seen that no power is dissipated in a pure inductor. In the first quarter of cycle both $V$ and $I$ are positive so the power is positive, which means energy is supplied to inductor. In the second quarter, $V$ is positive but $I$ is negative. Now power is negative which implies that energy is returned by the inductor. Again in third quarter, it receives energy but returns the same amount in the fourth quarter. Thus, there is no net change of energy in a complete cycle. Since an inductor coil does not consume energy, the coil is often employed for controlling A.C. without consumption of energy. Such an inductance coil is known as choke.\n\n### 16.6 IMPEDANCE\n\nWe already know that resistance $R$ offers opposition to the flow of current. In case of A.C. an inductance $L$ or a capacitance $C$ also offer opposition to the flow of A.C. which is measured by reactances $X_{L}$ and $X_{C}$ respectively. An A.C. circuit may consist of a resistance $R$, an inductance $L$, a capacitance $C$ or a combination of these elements. The combined effect of resistance and reactances in such a circuit is known as impedance and is denoted by $Z$.\nIt is measured by the ratio of the rms value of the applied voltage to the rms value of resulting A.C. Thus\n\n$$\nZ=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{I_{\\mathrm{rms}}}\n$$\n\nIt is also expressed in ohms.\nExample 16.3: When 10 V are applied to an A.C. circuit, the current flowing in it is 100 mA . Find its impedance.\n\n# Solution:\n\nrms value of applied voltage $=V_{\\text {mix }}=10 \\mathrm{~V}$\nrms value of current $=I_{\\text {mix }}=100 \\mathrm{~mA}=100 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~A}$\nImpedance $Z=\\frac{V_{\\text {mix }}}{I_{\\text {mix }}}=\\frac{10 \\mathrm{~V}}{100 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~A}}=100 \\Omega$\n\n### 16.7 R-C AND R-L SERIES CIRCUITS\n\nConsider a series network of resistance $R$ and a capacitor $C$ excited by an alternating voltage (Fig.16.11 a). As $R$ and $C$ are in series, the same current would flow through each of them. If $I_{\\text {mix }}$ is the value of current, the potential difference across the resistance $R$ would be $I_{\\text {mix }} R$ and it would be in phase with current $I_{\\text {mix }}$. The vector diagram of the voltage and current is shown in Fig. 16.11 (b). Taking the current as reference, the potential difference $I_{\\text {mix }} R$ across the resistance is represented by a line along the current line because potential drop $I_{\\text {mix }} R$ is in phase with current. The potential difference across the capacitor will be $I_{\\text {mix }} X_{c}=I_{\\text {mix }} / \\omega C$. As this voltage lags the current by $90^{\\circ}$, so the line representing the vector $I_{\\text {mix }} / \\omega C$ is drawn at right angles to the current line (Fig. 16.11 b).\nThe applied voltage $V_{\\text {mix }}$ that will send the current $I$ in the circuit is obtained by the resultant of the vectors $I_{\\text {mix }} R$ and $\\frac{I_{\\text {mix }}}{\\omega C}$ i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& V_{\\text {mix }}=\\sqrt{\\left(I_{\\text {mix }} R\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{I_{\\text {mix }}}{\\omega C}\\right)^{2}} \\\\\n& V_{\\text {mix }}=I_{\\text {mix }} \\sqrt{R^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\right)^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nImpedance $Z=\\frac{V_{\\text {mix }}}{I_{\\text {mix }}}=\\sqrt{R^{2}+\\frac{1}{(\\omega C)^{2}}}$\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFig 16.11\n\n$$\n\\theta=\\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega C R}\\right)\n$$\n\nEq.16.15 suggests that we can find the impedance of a series A.C. circuit by vector addition. The resistance $R$ is represented by a horizontal line in the direction of current which is taken as reference. The reactance $X_{C}=\\frac{1}{\\omega C}$ is shown by a line lagging the $\\mathbf{R}$ - line by $90^{\\circ}$ (Fig.16.11 c). The impedance $\\mathbf{Z}$ of the circuit is obtained by the vector summation of resistance and reactance. Fig.16.11 (c) is known as impedance diagram of the circuit. The angle which the line representing the impedance $\\mathbf{Z}$ makes with $\\mathbf{R}$ line gives the phase difference between the voltage and current. In Fig.16.11(c), the current is leading the voltage applied by an angle\n\n$$\n\\theta=\\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{X_{C}}{R}\\right)=\\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega C R}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow we will calculate the impedance of a $R-L$ series circuit by drawing its impedance diagram. Fig.16.12 (a) shows an $R-L$ series circuit excited by an A.C. source of frequency $\\omega$. The current is taken as reference, so it is represented by a horizontal line. Resistance $R$ is drawn along this line because the potential drop $I_{\\text {mix }} R$ is in phase with current. As the potential across the inductance $V_{L}=I_{\\text {mix }} X_{L}=I_{\\text {mix }}(\\omega L)$ leads the current by $90^{\\circ}$, so the vector line of reactance $X_{L}=\\omega L$ is drawn at right angle to $R$ line (Fig. 16.12 b). The impedance $Z$ of the circuit is obtained by the vector sum of $R$ and $\\omega L$ lines. Thus\n\n$$\nZ=\\sqrt{R^{2}+(\\omega L)^{2}}\n$$\n\nThe angle $\\theta=\\tan ^{-1} \\frac{\\omega L}{R}$ which $Z$ makes with $R$ line gives the phase difference between the applied voltage and current. In this case the voltage leads the current by $\\theta^{\\circ}$. By comparing the impedance diagrams of $R-C$ and $L-R$ circuits, it can be seen that the vector lines of reactances $X_{C}$ and $X_{L}$ are directed opposite to each other with $R$ as reference.\n\n# 16.8 POWER IN A.C. CIRCUITS\n\nThe expression for power is $P=V_{\\text {mix }} I_{\\text {mix }}$. This expression is true in case of A.C. circuits, only when $V$ and $I$ are in phase as in\n\ncase of a purely resistive circuit. We have already seen that the power dissipation in a pure inductive or in a pure capacitance circuit is zero. In these cases the current lags or leads the applied voltage by $90^{\\circ}$ and component of applied voltage vector $V$ along the current vector is zero (Fig. 16.9 c and 16.10 c ). In A.C. circuit the phase difference between applied voltage $V$ and the current $I_{\\text {mix }}$ is $\\theta$ (Fig. 16.11 b and 16.12 b ). The component of $\\mathbf{V}$ along current $I_{\\text {mix }}$ is $V_{\\text {mix }} \\cos \\theta$. Actually it is this component of voltage vector which is in phase with current. So the power dissipated in A.C. circuit\n\n$$\nP=I_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\times V_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\nThe factor $\\cos \\theta$ is known as power factor.\nExample 16.4: At what frequency will an inductor of 1.0 H have a reactance of $500 \\Omega$ ?\n\n# Solution:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nL=1.0 \\mathrm{H} \\quad, \\quad X_{\\mathrm{L}}=500 \\Omega \\\\\nX_{\\mathrm{L}}=\\omega L=2 \\pi f L=500 \\Omega \\\\\nf=\\frac{500 \\Omega}{2 \\pi L}=\\frac{500 \\Omega}{2 \\pi \\times 1.0 \\mathrm{H}}=80 \\mathrm{~Hz}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nExample 16.5: An iron core coil of 2.0 H and $50 \\Omega$ is placed in series with a resistance of $450 \\Omega$.

The impedance diagram of the circuit is shown in Fig.16.13 (b). As explained earlier, the inductive reactance $X_{\\mathrm{L}}=\\omega L$ and capacitor reactance $X_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{\\omega \\mathrm{C}}$ are directed opposite to each other. When the frequency of A.C. source is very small $X_{\\mathrm{C}}=\\frac{1}{\\omega \\mathrm{C}}$ is much greater than $X_{\\mathrm{L}}=\\omega L$. So the capacitance dominates at low frequencies and the circuit\n\nbehaves like an $R-C$ circuit. At high frequencies $X_{L}=\\omega L$ is much greater than $X_{C}=\\frac{1}{\\omega C}$. In this case the inductance dominates and the circuit behaves like $R-L$ circuit. In between these frequencies there will be a frequency $\\omega_{r}$ at which $X_{L}=X_{C}$. This condition is called resonance. Thus at resonance the inductive reactance being equal and opposite to capacitor reactance, cancel each other and the impedance diagram assumes the form (Fig.16.13 c). The value of the resonance frequency can be obtained by putting\n\n$$\n\\omega_{r} L=\\frac{1}{\\omega_{r} C}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\omega_{r}^{2}=\\frac{1}{L C} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\omega_{r}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}}\n$$\n\n$$\nf_{r}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{L C}}\n$$\n\nThe following are the properties of the series resonance.\ni) The resonance frequency is given by\n\n$$\nf_{r}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{L C}}\n$$\n\nii) The impedance of the circuit at resonance is resistive so the current and voltage are in phase. The power factor is 1 .\niii) The impedance of the circuit is minimum at this frequency and it is equal to $R$.\niv) If the amplitude of the source voltage $V_{s}$ is constant, the current is a maximum at the resonance frequency and its value is $V_{s} / R$. The variation of current with the frequency is shown in Fig. 16.14.\nv) At resonance $V_{L}$, the voltage drop across inductance and $V_{C}$ the voltage drop across capacitance may be much larger than the source voltage.\n\n### 16.10 PARALLELRESONANCE CIRCUIT\n\nFig. 16.15 shows an $L-C$ parallel circuit. It is excited by an alternating source of voltage whose frequency could be varied. The inductance coil $L$ has a resistance $r$ which is negligibly small. The capacitor draws a leading current.\nFig. 16.13\nFig. 16.14\n\nFig. 16.15\nFig. 16.16\nwhereas the coil draws a lagging current. The circuit resonates at a frequency $\\omega=\\omega_{1}$ which makes $X_{L}=X_{C}$, so that the two branch currents are equal but opposite Hence, they cancel out with the result that the current drawn from the supply is zero. In actual practice, the current is not zero but has a minimum value due to small resistance $r$ of the coil\nProperties of parallel resonant circuits are\ni) Resonance frequency is $f_{1}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{L C}}$\nii) At the resonance frequency, the circuit impedance is maximum. It is resistive.\niii) At the resonance the current is minimum and it is in phase with the applied voltage. So the power factor is one. The variation of current with the frequency of the source is shown in Fig. 16.16.\niv) At resonance, the branch currents $I_{L}$ and $I_{C}$ may each be larger than the source current $I_{r}$.\nExample 16.7: Find the capacitance required to construct a resonance circuit of frequency 1000 kHz with an inductor of 5 mH .\n\n## Solution:\n\nResonance frequency $\\quad=f_{1}=1000 \\mathrm{kHz}$\n\n$$\nL=5 \\mathrm{mH}=5 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{H} \\quad, \\quad \\mathrm{C}=?\n$$\n\nResonance frequency $=f_{1}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{L C}}$\n$C=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi^{2} f_{1}^{2} L}=\\frac{1}{4 \\times(3.14)^{2} \\times\\left(10^{5} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\right)^{2} \\times 5 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{H}}=5.09 \\mathrm{pF}$\n\n### 16.11 THREE PHASE A.C. SUPPLY\n\nWe have already studied that an A.C. generator consists of a coil with a pair of slip rings. As the coil rotates an alternating voltage is generated across the slip rings. In a three phase A.C. generator, instead of one coil, there are three coils inclined at $120^{\\circ}$ to each other, each connected to its own pair of slip rings. When this combination of three coils rotate in the magnetic field, each coil generates an alternating voltage across its own pair of slip rings. Thus, three alternating voltages are generated. The phase difference between these voltages is $120^{\\circ}$. It means that when voltage across the first\n\npair of slip rings is zero, having a phase of 0 , the voltage across the second pair of slip rings would not be zero but it will have a phase of $120^{\\circ}$. Similarly at this instant the voltage generated across the third pair will have a phase $240^{\\circ}$. This is shown in Fig. 16.17. The machine, instead of having six terminals, two for each pair of slip rings, has only four terminals because the starting point of all the three coils has a common junction which is often earthed to the shaft of the generator and the other three ends of the coils are connected to three separate terminals on the machine. These four terminals along with the lines and coils connected to them are shown in Fig.16.18. The voltage across each of lines connected to terminals $A, B, C$ and the neutral line is 230 V . Because of $120^{\\circ}$ phase shift, the voltage across any two lines is about 400 V . The main advantage of having a three phase supply is that the total load of the house or a factory is divided in three parts, so that none of the line is over loaded. If heavy load consisting of a number of air conditioners and motors etc., is supplied power from a single phase supply, its voltage is likely to drop at full load. Moreover, the three phase supply also provides 400 V which can be used to operate some special appliances requiring 400 V for their operation.\n\n# 16.12 PRINCIPLE OF METAL DETECTORS\n\nA coil and a capacitor are electrical components which together can produce oscillations of current. An $L-C$ circuit behaves just like an oscillating mass - spring system. In this case energy oscillates between a capacitor and an inductor. The circuit is called an electrical oscillator. Two such oscillators $A$ and $B$ are used in the operation of a common type of metal detector (Fig.16.19). In the absence of any nearby\nFig. 16.18\n\nFig 16.20\nmetal object, the inductances $L_{A}$ and $L_{B}$ are the same and hence the resonance frequency of the two circuits is also same. When the inductor $B$, called the search coil comes near a metal object, its inductance $L_{B}$ decreases and corresponding oscillator frequency increases and thus a beat note is heard in the attached speaker. Such detectors are extensively used not only for various security checks but also to locate buried metal objects.\n\n### 16.13 CHOKE\n\nIt is a coil which consists of thick copper wire wound closely in a large number of turns over a soft iron laminated cores. This makes the inductance $L$ of the coil quite large whereas its resistance $R$ is very small. Thus it consumes extremely small power. It is used in A.C. circuits to limit current with extremely small wastage of energy as compared to a resistance or a rheostat.\n\n### 16.14 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES\n\nIt is a very important class of waves which requires no medium for transmission and which rapidly propagates through vacuum.\nIn 1864 British physicist James Clark Maxwell formulated a set of equations known as Maxwell's equations which explained the various electromagnetic phenomena. According to these equations, a changing magnetic flux creates an electric field and a changing electric flux creates a magnetic field. Consider a region of space $A B$ as shown in Fig.16.20. Suppose a change of magnetic flux is taking place through it. This changing magnetic flux will set up a changing electric flux in the surrounding region. The creation of electric field in the region $C D$ will cause a change of electric flux through it due to which a magnetic field would be set up in the space surrounding $C D$ and so on. Thus each field generates the other and the whole package of electric and magnetic fields will move along propelling itself through space. Such moving electric and magnetic fields are known as electromagnetic waves. The electric field, magnetic field and the direction of their propagation are mutually orthogonal (Fig.16.21). It can be seen in this figure that the electromagnetic waves are periodic, hence they have a wavelength $\\lambda$ which is given by the relation $c=f \\lambda$ where $f$ is the frequency and $c$ is the speed of the wave. In free space the speed of electromagnetic waves is $3 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$.\n\nFig. 16.21\nDepending upon the values of wavelength and frequency, the electromagnetic waves have been classified into different types of waves as radiowaves, microwaves, infrared rays, visible light etc. Fig. 16.22 shows the complete spectrum of\nFig. 16.22\nThe electromagnetic spectrum\nElectromagnetic waves from the low radio waves to high frequency gamma rays.\n\n# 16.15 PRINCIPLE OF GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND RECEPTION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES\n\nWe have seen that electromagnetic waves are generated when electric or magnetic flux is changing through a certain region of space. An electric charge at rest gives rise to a Coulomb's field which does not radiate in space because no change of flux takes place in this type of field. A charge moving with constant velocity is equivalent to a steady current which generates a constant magnetic field in the\n\nTit-bits\nShake an electrically charged object to and fro, and you produce electromagnet waves.\n\nFig. 16.23\n\nDo You Know?\nWhen electrons in the transmitting antenna vibrate 94,000 times each second, they produced radio waves having frequency 94 kHz .\nFig. 16.24\nsurrounding space, but such a field also does not radiate out because no changes of magnetic flux are involved. Thus only chance to generate a wave of moving field is when we accelerate the electrical charges.\n\nA radio transmitting antenna provides a good example of generating electromagnetic waves by acceleration of charges. The piece of wire along which charges are made to accelerate is known as transmitting antenna (Fig.16.23). It is charged by an alternating source of potential of frequency $f$ and time period $T$. As the charging potential alternates, the charge on the antenna also constantly reverses. For example if the top has $+q$ charges at any instant, then after time $T / 2$ the charge on it will be $-q$. Such regular reversal of charges on the antenna gives rise to an electric flux that constantly changes with frequency $f$. This changing electric flux sets up an electromagnetic wave which propagates out in space away from the antenna. The frequency with which the fields alternate is always equal to the frequency of the source generating them. These electromagnetic waves which are propagated out in space from antenna of a transmitter are known as radio waves. In free space these waves travel with the speed of light.\nSuppose these waves impinge on a piece of wire (Fig.16.24). The electrons in the wire move under the action of the oscillating electric field which give rise to an alternating voltage across the wire. The frequency of this voltage is the same as that of the wave intercepting the wire. This wire receiving the wave is known as receiving antenna. As the electric field of the wave is very weak at a distance of many kilometres from the transmitter, the voltage that appears across the receiving antenna is very small. Each transmitter propagates radio waves of one particular frequency. So when a number of transmitting stations operate simultaneously, we have a number of radio waves of different frequencies in the space. Thus the voltage that appears across a receiving antenna placed in space is usually due to the radio waves of large number of frequencies. The voltage of one particular frequency can be picked up by connecting an inductance $L$ and a variable capacitor $C$ in parallel with one end of the receiving antenna (Fig.16.24).\nIf one adjusts the value of the capacitor so that the natural frequency of $L-C$ circuit is the same as that of the transmitting station to be picked up, the circuit will resonate\n\nunder the driving action of the antenna. Consequently, the $L-C$ circuit will build up a large response to the action of only that radio wave to which it is tuned. In your radio receiver set when you change stations you actually adjust the value of $C$.\n\n# 16.16 MODULATION\n\nSpeech and music etc. are transmitted hundred of kilometres away by a radio transmitter. The scene in front of a television camera is also sent many kilometres away to viewers. In all these uses, the carrier of the programme is a high frequency radio wave. The information i.e., light, sound or other data is impressed on the radio wave and is carried along with it to the destination.\n\nModulation is the process of combining the low frequency signal with a high frequency radio wave called carrier wave. The resultant wave is called modulated carrier wave. The low frequency signal is known as modulation signal. Modulation is achieved by changing the amplitude or the frequency of the carrier wave in accordance with the modulating signal. Thus we have two types of modulations which are\n\n1. Amplitude modulation (A.M), 2. Frequency modulation (F.M)\n\n## Amplitude Modulation\n\nIn this type of modulation the amplitude of the carrier wave is increased or diminished as the amplitude of the superposing modulating signal increases and decreases.\nFig. 16.25 (a) represents a high frequency carrier wave of constant amplitude and frequency. Fig.16.25(b) represents a low or audio frequency signal of a sine waveform. Fig. 16.25 (c) shows the result obtained by modulating thecarrier waves with the modulating wave. The A.M. transmission frequencies range from 540 kHz to 1600 kHz .\n\n## Frequency Modulation\n\nIn this type of modulation the frequency of the carrier wave is increased or diminished as the modulating signal amplitude increases or decreases but the carrier wave amplitude remains constant. Fig. 16.26 shows frequency modulation. The frequency of the modulated carrier wave is highest (point H ) when the signal amplitude is at its maximum positive value and is at its lowest frequency (point $L$ ) when signal amplitude has maximum negative. When the signal amplitude is zero, the carrier frequency is at its normal frequency $f_{n}$.\nFig. 16.25\nThe F.M. transmission frequencies are much higher and ranges between 88 MHz to 108 MHz . F.M. radio waves are affected less by electrical interference than A.M. radio waves and hence, provide a higher quality transmission of sound. However, they have a shorter range than A.M. waves and are less able to travel around obstacles such as hills and large buildings.\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nAlternating current is that which is produced by a voltage source whose polarity keeps on reversing with time.\n\nThe time interval during which the voltage source changes its polarity once is known as period $T$ of the alternating current or voltage.\n\nThe value of voltage or current that exists in a circuit at any instant of time measured from some reference point is known as its instantaneous value.\n\nThe highest value reached by the voltage or current in one cycle is called the peak value of the voltage or current.\n\nThe sum of positive and negative peak values is called peak to peak value and is written a $\\delta$ p-p value.\n\nThe root mean square value (rms) is the square root of the average value of $V^{2}$ or $I^{2}$.\nThe angle $\\theta$ which specifies the instantaneous value of the alternating voltage or current, gives the phase lag or phase lead of one quantity over the other.\n\nAn inductor is usually in the form of a coil or a solenoid wound from a thick wire so that it has a large value of self inductance and has negligible resistance.\n\nThe combined effect of resistance and reactance in a circuit is known as impedance and is denoted by $Z$.\n\nChoke is a coil which consists of thick copper wire wound closely in a large number of turns over a soft iron laminated core.\n\nElectromagnetic waves are those which require no medium for transmission and rapidly propagate through vacuum.\n\nModulation is the process of combining the low frequency signal with a high frequency radio wave, called carrier waves. The resultant wave is called modulated carrier wave.\n\n## QUESTIONS\n\n16.1 Asinusoidal current has rms value of 10 A .

It depends upon the structure - the particular order and bonding of atoms in a material. This clue has made it possible to design and create materials with new and unusual properties for use in modern technology.\n\n### 17.1 CLASSIFICATION OF SOLIDS\n\n## Crystalline Solids\n\nIn crystalline solids there is a regular arrangement of molecules. The neighbours of every molecule are arranged in a regular pattern that is constant throughout the crystal. There is, thus an ordered structure in crystalline solids.\n\nThe vast majority of solids, e.g., metals such as copper, iron and zinc, ionic compounds such as sodium chloride, ceramics such as zirconia are crystalline. The arrangement of molecules, atoms or ions within all types of crystalline solids can be studied using various X-ray techniques. It should be noted that atoms, molecules or ions in a crystalline solid are not static. For example, each atom in a metal crystal vibrates about a fixed point with an amplitude that increases with rise in temperature. It is the average atomic positions which are perfectly ordered over large distances.\n\nThe cohesive forces between atoms, molecules or ions in crystalline solids maintain the strict long-range order inspite of atomic vibrations. For every crystal, however, there is a temperature at which the vibrations become so great that the structure suddenly breaks up, and the solid melts. The transition from solid (order) to liquid (disorder) is, therefore, abrupt or discontinuous. Every crystalline solid has a definite melting point.\n\n# Amorphous or Glassy Solids\n\nThe word amorphous means without form or structure. Thus in amorphous solids there is no regular arrangement of molecules like that in crystalline solids. We can, therefore, say that amorphous solids are more like liquids with the disordered structure frozen in.\n\nFor example ordinary glass, which is a solid at ordinary temperature, has no regular arrangement of molecules. On heating, it gradually softens into a paste like state before it becomes a very viscous liquid at almost $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Thus amorphous solids are also called glassy solids. This type of solids have no definite melting point.\n\n## Polymeric Solids\n\nPolymers may be said to be more or less solid materials with a structure that is intermediate between order and disorder. They can be classified as partially or poorly crystalline solids.\n\nPolymers form a large group of naturally occurring and synthetic materials. Plastics and synthetic rubbers are termed 'Ploymers' because they are formed by polymerization reactions in which relatively simple molecules are chemically combined into massive long chain molecules, or \"three dimensional\" structures. These materials have rather low specific gravity compared with even the lightest of metals, and\n\nyet exhibit good strength-to-weight ratio.\nPolymers consist wholly or in part of chemical combinations of carbon with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and other metallic or non-metallic elements. Polythene, polystrene and nylon etc., are examples of polymers. Natural rubber is composed in the pure state entirely of a hydrocarbon with the formula $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{8}\\right)_{n}$.\n\n# Crystal Lattice\n\nA crystalline solid consists of three dimensional pattern that repeats itself over and over again. This smallest three dimensional basic structure is called unit cell. The whole structure obtained by the repetition of unit cell is known as crystal lattice. For example, the pattern of NaCl particles have a cube shape. The cube shape of the sodium chloride is just one of several crystal shapes. In a cubic crystal all the sides meet at right angles. Other crystal shapes have corners in which one or more of the angles are not right angles.\n\n### 17.2 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS\n\n## Deformation in Solids\n\nIf we hold a soft rubber ball in our hand and then squeeze it, the shape or volume of the ball will change. However, if we stop squeezing the ball, and open our hand, the ball will return to its original spherical shape. This has been illustrated schematically in Fig.17.1.\nSimilarly, if we hold two ends of a rubber string in our hands, and move our hands apart to some extent, the length of the string will increase under the action of the applied force exerted by our hands. Greater the applied force larger will be the increase in length. Now on removing the applied force, the string will return to its original length. From these examples, it is concluded that deformation (i.e., change in shape, length or volume) is produced when a body is subjected to some external force.\nIn crystalline solids atoms are usually arranged in a certain order. These atoms are held about their equilibrium position, which depends on the strength of the inter-atomic cohesive force between them. When external force is applied on such a body, a distortion results because of the displacement of the atoms from their equilibrium position and the body is said to be in a state of stress. After the removal of external force,\n\n## NaCl crystal lattice\nFig 17.1\n(a) Original rubber ball\n(b) Squeezed rubber ball subjected\nforce $F$ by the hand\n(c) Rubber ball after removing force\n\n(a) Unstretched unit cell\n(b) Unit cell under outward stretching force\n(c) Unit cell under inward applied force\n(d) Unit cell after removing applied force\nFig. 17.2\nthe atoms return to their equilibrium position, and the body regains its original shape, provided that external applied force was not too great. The ability of the body to return to its original shape is called elasticity. Fig.17.2 illustrates deformation produced in a unit cell of a crystal subjected to an external applied force.\n\n## Stress and Strain\n\nThe results of mechanical tests are usually expressed in terms of stress and strain, which are defined in terms of applied force and deformation.\n\n## Stress\n\nIt is defined as the force applied on unit area to produce any change in the shape, volume or length of a body. Mathematically it is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\text { Stress }(\\sigma)=\\frac{\\text { Force }(F)}{\\text { Area }(A)}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of stress ( $\\sigma$ ) is newton per square metre ( $\\mathrm{Nm}^{-2}$ ), which is given the name pascal (Pa).\nStress may cause a change in length, volume and shape. When a stress changes length, it is called the tensile stress, when it changes the volume it is called the volume stress and when it changes the shape it is called the shear stress.\n\n## Strain\n\nStrain is a measure of the deformation of a solid when stress is applied to it. In the case of deformation in one dimension, strain is defined as the fractional change in length. If $\\Delta \\ell$ is the change in length and $\\ell$ is the original length (Fig. 17.3 a), then strain is given by\n\n$$\n\\text { Strain }(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{\\text { Change in length }(\\Delta \\ell)}{\\text { Original length }(\\ell)}\n$$\n\nSince strain is ratio of lengths, it is dimensionless, and therefore, has no units. If strain $\\varepsilon$ is due to tensile stress $\\sigma$, it is called tensile strain, and if it is produced as a result of compressive stress $\\sigma$, it is termed as compressive strain.\nIn case when the applied stress changes the volume, the change in volume per unit volume is known as volumetric strain (Fig. 17.3 b). Thus\n\n$$\n\\text { Volumetric strain }=\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_{0}}\n$$\n\nNow referring to Fig. 17.3 (c), when the opposite faces of a rigid cube are subjected to shear stress, the shear strain produced is given by\n\n$$\n\\gamma=\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}=\\tan \\theta\n$$\n\nHowever, for small values of angle $\\theta$, measured in radian, $\\tan \\theta=\\theta$, so that\n\n$$\n\\gamma=\\theta\n$$\n\nSince strain is a dimensionless quantity, the units of modulus of elasticity are the same as those of stress, i.e., $\\mathrm{Nm}^{-3}$ or Pa .\nIn the case of linear deformation, the ratio of tensile (or compressive) stress $\\sigma(=F / A)$ to tensile (or compressive) strain $\\varepsilon=\\Delta \\ell / \\ell$ is called Young's modulus.\n\n$$\nY=\\frac{F / A}{\\Delta \\ell / \\ell}\n$$\n\nFor three dimensional deformation, when volume is involved, then the ratio of applied stress to volumetric strain is called Bulk modulus.\n\n$$\nK=\\frac{F / A}{\\Delta V / V}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta V$ is the change in original volume $V$.\nHowever, when the shear stress $\\tau=(F / A)$ and shear strain $\\gamma(=\\tan \\theta)$ are involved, then their ratio is called shear modulus.\n\n$$\nG=\\frac{F / A}{\\tan \\theta}\n$$\n\nFig.17.3\n(a) Wire pulled along its length by stretching force $F$.\n(b) Cylinder subjected to compressive force $F$.\n(c) Cube subjected to shearing force $F$.\n\n## There are seven different crystals systems based on the geometrical arrangement of their atoms and the resultant geometrical structures.\nTable17.1 Elastic constants for some materials\n\n| Material | Young <br> Modulus | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { 2 } \\\\ \\text { \\% } \\\\ \\text { \\% } \\\\ \\text { \\% } \\\\ \\text { \\% } \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { \\% } \\\\ \\text { \\% } \\\\ \\text { \\% } \\\\ \\text { \\% } \\\\ \\text { \\% } \\end{gathered}$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Aluminium | 70 | 70 | 30 |\n| Bone | 15 | * | 80 |\n| Brass | 91 | 61 | 36 |\n| Concrete | 25 | * | - |\n| Copper | 110 | 140 | 44 |\n| Diamond | 1120 | 540 | 450 |\n| Glass | 55 | 31 | 23 |\n| Ice | 14 | 8 | 3 |\n| Lead | 15 | 7.7 | 5.6 |\n| Mercury | 0 | 27 | 0 |\n| Steel | 200 | 160 | 84 |\n| Tungsten | 390 | 200 | 150 |\n| Water | 0 | 2.2 | 0 |\n\nFig.17.4 Stress-strain curve of a typical ductile material.\n\nElastic constants for some of the materials are given in Table 17.1.\n\n## Elastic Form and Yield Strength\n\nIn a tensile test, metal wire is extended at a specified deformation rate, and stresses generated in the wire during deformation are continuously measured by a suitable electronic device fitted in the mechanical testing machine. Force-elongation diagram or stress-strain curve is plotted automatically on X-Y chart recorder. A typical stress-strain curve for a ductile material is shown in Fig. 17.4.\nIn the initial stage of deformation, stress is increased linearly with the strain till we reach point $A$ on the stress-strain curve. This is called proportional limit ( $\\sigma_{p}$ ). It is defined as the greatest stress that a material can endure without losing straight line proportionality between .stress and strain. Hooke's law which states that the strain is directly proportional to stress is obeyed in the region OA. From A to $B$, stress and strain are not proportional, but nevertheless, if the load is removed at any point between $O$ and $B$, the curve will be retraced and the material will return to its original length. In the region OB, the material is said to be elastic. The point $B$ is called the yield point. The value of stress at $B$ is known as elastic limit $\\sigma_{e}$. If the stress is increased beyond the yield stress or elastic limit of the material, the specimen becomes permanently changed and does not recover its original shape or dimension after the stress is removed. This kind of behaviour is called plasticity.\n\nThe region of plasticity is represented by the portion of the curve from $B$ to $C$, the point $C$ in Fig. 17.4 represents the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) $\\sigma_{m}$ of the material. The UTS is defined as the maximum stress that a material can withstand, and can be regarded as the nominal strength of the material. Once point $C$ corresponding to UTS is crossed, the material breaks at point $D$, responding the fracture stress $\\left(\\sigma_{f}\\right)$.\n\nSubstances which undergo plastic deformation until they break, are known as ductile substances. Lead, copper and wrought iron are ductile. Other substances which break just after the elastic limit is reached, are known as brittle substances. Glass and high carbon steel are brittle.\nExample 17.1: A steel wire 12 mm in diameter is fastened\n\nto a log and is then pulled by tractor. The length of steel wire between the log and the tractor is 11 m . A force of $10,000 \\mathrm{~N}$ is required to pull the log. Calculate (a) the stress in the wire and (b) the strain in the wire. (c) How much does the wire stretch when the log is pulled? $\\left(E=200 \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{Nm}^{-3}\\right)$\n\n## Solution:\n\n(a) As tensile stress $\\sigma=\\frac{F}{A}=\\frac{10,000 \\mathrm{~N}}{3.14 \\times\\left(6 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)^{2}}$\n\n$$\n=88.46 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{Nm}^{-2}=88.46 \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n\n(b) The tensile strain $\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\Delta \\ell}{\\ell}$\n\nAlso $\\quad E=\\frac{\\text { Stress }}{\\text { Strain }}=\\frac{88.46 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{Nm}^{-2}}{\\text { Strain }}=200 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{Nm}^{-2}$\n\n$$\n\\text { Strain }=\\frac{88.46 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{Nm}^{-2}}{200 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{Nm}^{-2}}=4.4 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\n\n(c) Now using the relation Strain $=\\frac{\\Delta \\ell}{\\ell}$, we get\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\ell=4.4 \\times 10^{-4} \\times 11 \\mathrm{~m}=4.84 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~m}=4.84 \\mathrm{~mm}\n$$\n\n## Strain Energy in Deformed Materials\n\nConsider a wire suspended vertically from one end. It is stretched by attaching a weight at the other end. We can increase the stretching force by increasing the weight. By noting the extension $\\ell$ of the wire for different values of the stretching force $F$, a graph can be drawn between the force $F$ and the extension $\\ell$ (Fig.17.5). If the elastic limit is not exceeded, the extension is directly proportional to force $F$. As the force $F$ stretches the wire, it does some amount of work on wire which is equal to product of force $F$ and the extension $\\ell$. Suppose we are required to find the amount of the work done when the extension is $\\ell_{1}$. Let the force for this extension be $F_{1}$. Fig. 17.5 shows that the force $F$ does not remain constant in producing the extension $\\ell_{1}$, it varies uniformly from 0 to $F_{1}$. In such a situation the work is calculated by graphical method.\nSuppose at some stage before the extension $\\ell_{1}$ is reached, the force in the wire is $F$ and that the wire now extends by a very small amount $\\Delta x$. The extension $\\Delta x$ is so small that the force $F$ may be assumed constant in $\\Delta x$, so the work done in producing this small extension is $F \\times \\Delta x$. In the figure it can be\n\n## This is a machine used to investigate the way the extension of a material varies with the force stretching it.\nEnergy in stretched wire\nFig. 17.5\n\nseen that it is represented by the area of the shaded strip. In this way the total extension $\\ell_{1}$ can be divided into very small extensions and the work done during each of these small extensions would be given by the area of the strips (Fig. 17.5). So the total work done in producing the extension $\\ell_{1}$ is the sum area of all these strips which is equal to area between the graph and the axis on which extension has been plotted upto $\\ell=\\ell_{1}$. In this case it equals to area of the triangle OAB.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\therefore \\quad \\text { Work done } & =\\text { Area of } \\Delta \\mathrm{OAB} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{OAxAB}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n=\\frac{1}{2} \\ell_{1} \\times F_{1}\n$$\n\nThis is the amount of energy stored in the wire. It is the gain in the potential energy of the molecules due to their displacement from their mean positions. Eq. 17.9 gives the energy in joules when $F$ is in newton and $\\ell$ in metres.\n\nEq.17.9 can also be expressed in terms of modulus of elasticity $E$. If $A$ is the area of cross-section of the wire and $L$ its total length then\nor\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E=\\frac{F_{1}}{A} \\times \\frac{L}{\\ell_{1}} \\\\\n& F_{1}=\\frac{E A \\times \\ell_{1}}{L}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the value of $F_{1}$ in Eq. 17.9 we have\n\n$$\n\\text { Work done }=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{E A \\times \\ell_{1}^{2}}{L}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe area method is quite a general one. For example if the extension is increased from $\\ell_{1}$ to $\\ell_{2}$, the amount of work done by the stretching force would be given by the area of the trapezium ABCD (Fig.17.5). It is also valid for both the linear (elastic) and the non-linear (non-elastic) parts of the forceextension graph. If the extension occurs from $O$ to $G$ (Fig.17.5), this work done would be the area of OHG.\n\n# 17.3 ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS\n\nThe fundamental electrical property of a solid is its response to an applied electric field, i.e., its ability to conduct electric current. The electrical behaviours of various materials are\n\ndiverse. Some are very good conductors, e.g., metals with conductivities of the order of $10^{7}(\\Omega \\mathrm{~m})^{1}$. At the other extreme, some solids, e.g., wood, diamond etc., have very low conductivities ranging between $10^{-10}$ and $10^{-20}(\\Omega \\mathrm{~m})^{11}$, these are called insulators. Solids with intermediate conductivities, generally from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-4}(\\Omega \\mathrm{~m})^{11}$, are termed semiconductors, e.g., silicon, germanium etc. The conventional free electron theory based on Bohr model of electron distribution in an atom failed to explain completely the vast diversity in the electrical behaviour of these three types of materials.\nOn the other hand, energy band theory based on wave mechanical model has been found successful in resolving the problem.\n\n# Energy Band Theory\n\nElectrons of an isolated atom are bound to the nucleus, and can only have distinct energy levels. However, when a large number of atoms, say N , are brought close to one another to form a solid, each energy level of the isolated atom splits into N sub-levels, called states, under the action of the forces exerted by other atoms in the solid. These permissible energy states are discrete but so closely spaced that they appear to form a continuous energy band. In between two consecutive permissible energy bands, there is a range of energy states which cannot be occupied by electrons. These are called forbidden energy states, and its range is termed as forbidden energy gap.\nThe electrons in the outermost shell of an atom are called valence electrons and the energy band occupying these electrons is known as valence band. It is obviously the highest occupied band. It may be either completely filled or partially filled with electrons and can never be empty. The band above the valence band is called conduction band. In conduction band, electrons move freely and conduct electric current through solids. That is why the electrons occupying this band are known as conductive electrons or free electrons. Any electron leaving the valence band is accommodated by this band. It may be either empty or partially filled with electrons. The bands below the valence band are normally completely filled and as such play no part in the conduction process. Thus, while discussing the electrical conductivity we will consider only the valence and conduction bands.\n\n## Glass is also known as solid liquid because its molecules are irregularly arranged as in a liquid but fixed in their relative positions.\n\nInsulators Insulators are those materials in which valence electrons are bound very tightly to their atoms and are not free. In terms of energy bands, it means that an insulator, as shown in Fig. 17.6 has\na) an empty conduction band (no free electrons)\nb) a full valence band\nc) a large energy gap (several eV ) between them\n\nConductors Conductors are those which have plenty of free electrons for electrical conduction. In terms of energy bands, conductors are those materials in which valence and conduction bands largely overlap each other (Fig.17.7). There is no physical distinction between the two bands which ensures the availability of a large number of free electrons.\nSemiconductors In terms of energy bands, semiconductors are those materials which at room temperature have\n(i) partially filled conduction band (ii) partially filled valence band (iii) a very narrow forbidden energy gap (of the order of 1 eV ) between the conduction and valence bands (Fig.17.8).\nAt 0 K , there are no electrons in the conduction band and their valence band are completely filled. It means at 0 K , a piece of Ge or Si is a perfect insulator. However, with increase in temperature, some electrons posses sufficient energy to jump across the small energy gap from valence to conduction band. This transfers some free electrons in the conduction bands and creates some vacancies of electrons in the valence band. The vacancy of electron in the valence band is known as a hole. It behaves like a positive charge. Thus at room temperature, Ge or Si crystal becomes a semiconductor.\n\n# Intrinsic and Extrinsic Semi-conductor\n\nA semi-conductor in its extremely pure form is known as intrinsic semi-conductor. The electrical behaviour of semiconductor is extremely sensitive to the purity of the material. It is substantially changed on introducing a small amount of impurity into the pure semi-conductor lattice. The process is called doping, in which a small number of atoms of some other suitable elements are added as impurity in the ratio of 1 to $10^{6}$. The doped semi-conducting materials are called extrinsic semi-conductors.\nPure element of silicon and germanium are intrinsic\n\nsemi-conductors. These semi-conductor elements have atoms with four valence electrons. In solid crystalline form, the atoms of these elements arrange themselves in such a pattern that each atom has four equidistant neighbours. Fig. 17.9 shows this pattern along with its valence electrons. Each atom with its four valence electrons, shares an electron from its neighbours. This effectively allocates eight electrons in the outermost shell of each atom which is a stable state. This sharing of electrons between two atoms creates covalent bonds. Due to these covalent bonds electrons are bound in their respective shells.\n\nWhen a silicon crystal is doped with a pentavalent element, e.g., arsenic, antimony or phosphorous etc., four valence electrons of the impurity atom form covalent bond with the four neighbouring Si atoms, while the fifth valence electron provides a free electron in the crystal. Such a doped or extrinsic semi-conductor is called n-type semi-conductor. Fig. 17.10(a) illustrates silicon crystal lattice doped with a pentavalent impurity such as phosphorous. The phosphorous atom is called a donor atom because it readily donates a free electron, which is thermally excited into the conduction band.\nOn the other hand, when a silicon crystal is doped with a trivalent element, e.g., aluminium, boron, gallium or indium etc., three valence electrons of the impurity atom form covalent bond with the three neighbouring Si atoms, while the one missing electron in the covalent bond with the fourth neighbouring Si atom, is called a hole which in fact is vacancy where an electron can be accommodated. Such a semiconductor is called p-type semi-conductor. Fig. 17.10 (b) illustrates silicon crystal lattice doped with aluminium. The aluminium atom is called an acceptor atom because it is easy for the aluminium ion core to accept a valence electron from a nearby silicon atom, thus creating a hole in the valence bond.\n\n# Electrical Conduction by Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors\n\nConsider a semi-conductor crystal lattice, e.g., Ge or Si as shown in Fig. 17.11. The circles represent the positiveion cores of Si or Ge atoms, and the blue dots are valence electrons. These electrons are bound by covalent bond. However, at room temperature they have thermal kinetic motion which, in case of some electrons, is so vigorous that\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFig. 17.10\nFig. 17.11\n\nFig. 17.12\nthe covalent bond is unable to keep them bound. In such cases the electrons break the covalent bond and get themselves free leaving a vacant seat for an electron, i.e., a hole. Thus whenever a covalent bond is broken, an electronhole pair is created. Both the electrons and the holes move in the semi-conductor crystal lattice as explained below.\nConsider a row of Si atoms in crystal lattice. Suppose a hole is present in the valence shell of atom $A$. As hole is a deficiency of electron, so the core of atom $A$ would have a net positive charge (Fig. 17.12 a). This attracts an electron from a neighbouring atom say B. Thus the electron moves from $B$ to $A$ and the hole ( +ve charge) shifts to $B$ (Fig. 17.12 a,b). Now an electron is attracted from $C$ to $B$ and a hole is created at $C$ (Fig. 17.12 b,c) and positive charge appears at $C$. This process is repeated between the atoms $C$ and $D$ with the result that the electron moves from $D$ to $C$ and the hole ( +ve charge) appears at $D$ (Fig. 17.12 c,d). Thus we notice that if a hole is present in any valence shell, it cannot stay there but it moves from one atom to other with the electron moving in opposite direction. Secondly we notice that the appearance of hole is accompanied by a positive charge. Thus a moving hole is equivalent to a moving positive charge.\nIn this example we have considered a special case in which the electron and the hole are moving in a straight line. Actually their motion is random because positively charged core of the atom can attract an electron from any of its neighbouring atoms.\nThus, in semi-conductors there are two kinds of charge carriers; a free electron $(-e)$ and a hole $(+e)$.\nWhen a battery is connected to a semi-conductor, it establishes an electric field across it due to which a directed flow of electrons and holes takes place. The electrons drift towards the positive end, whereas the holes drift towards the negative end of the semi-conductor (Fig.17.13). The current $I$ flowing through the semi-conductor is carried by both electrons and holes. It may be noted that the electronic current and the hole current add up together to give the current $I$.\n\n# 17.4 SUPERCONDUCTORS\n\nThere are some materials whose resistivity becomes zero below a certain temperature $T_{c}$ called critical temperature as shown in resistivity-temperature graph in Fig. 17.14. Below this temperature, such materials are called superconductors.\n\nThey offer no resistance to electric current and are, therefore, perfect conductors. Once the resistance of a material drops to zero, no energy is dissipated and the current, once established, continues to exist indefinitely without the source of an emf.\n\nThe first superconductor was discovered in 1911 by Kmaerlingh Omes when it was observed that electrical resistance of mercury disappears suddenly as the temperature is reduced below 4.2 K . Some other metals such as aluminium $\\left(T_{c}=1.18 \\mathrm{~K}\\right)$, tin $\\left(T_{c}=3.72 \\mathrm{~K}\\right)$, and lead $\\left(T_{c}=7.2 \\mathrm{~K}\\right)$ also become superconductors at very low temperatures. In 1986 a new class of ceramic materials was discovered that becomes superconductor at temperatures as high as 125 K . Any superconductor with a critical temperature above 77 K , the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, is referred as a high temperature superconductor.\n\nRecently a complex crystalline structure known as Yttrium barium copper oxide $\\left(\\mathrm{YBa}_{2} \\mathrm{Cu}_{3}, \\mathrm{O}_{1}\\right)$ have been reported to become superconductor at 163 K or $-110^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ by Prof. Yao Lian's Lee at Cambridge University. Perhaps one day even room temperature superconductor will be developed and that day will be a new revolution in electrical technologies. Superconductors have many technological applications such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic levitation trains, powerful but small electric motors and faster computer chips.\n\n### 17.5 MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS\n\nFrom the study of the magnetic fields produced by bar magnets and moving charges, i.e., currents, it is possible to trace the origin of the magnetic properties of the material. It is observed that the field of a long bar magnet is like the field produced by a long solenoid carrying current and the field of a short bar magnet resembles that of a single loop (Fig.17.15). This similarity between the fields produced by magnets and currents urges an enquiring mind to think that all magnetic effects may be due to circulating currents (i.e., moving charges); a view first held by Ampere. The idea was not considered very favourably in Ampere's time because the structure of atom was not known at that time. Taking into consideration, the internal structure of atom, discovered thereafter, the Ampere's view appears to be basically correct.\nThe magnetism produced by electrons within an atom can\n\n## Super conductors are alloys that, at certain temperatures, conduct electricity with no resistance.\n\nFor Your Information\nMagnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) uses strong magnetic field produced by super conducting materials for scanning computer processing produces the image identifying tumors and inflamed tissues\nLong Bar magnet\n(a)\nFig. 17.15\n\nMagnet field of a current loop\nFig. 17.19\n\n## For Your Infornation\n\nA squid in use\nSquids ( or super-conducting quantum interference devices) are used to detect very weak magnetic filed such as produced by the brain.\narise from two motions. First, each electron orbiting the nucleus behaves like an atomic sized loop of current that generates a small magnetic field; this situation is similar to the field created by the current loop in Fig. 17.15 (d). Secondly each electron possesses a spin that also gives rise to a magnetic field. The net magnetic field created by the electrons within an atom is due to the combined field created by their orbital and spin motions. Since there are a number of electrons in an atom, their currents or spins may be so oriented or aligned as to cancel the magnetic effects mutually or strengthen the effects of each other. An atom in which there is a resultant magnetic field, behaves like a tiny magnet and is called a magnetic dipole. The magnetic fields of the atoms are responsible for the magnetic behaviour of the substance made up of these atoms. Magnetism is, therefore, due to the spin and orbital motion of the electrons surrounding the nucleus and is thus a property of all substances. It may be mentioned that the charged nucleus itself spins giving rise to a magnetic field. However, it is much weaker than that of the orbital electrons. Thus the source of magnetism of an atom is the electrons. Accepting this view of magnetism it is concluded that it is impossible to obtain an isolated north pole. The north-pole is merely one side of a current loop. The other side will always be present as a south pole and these cannot be separated. This is an experimental reality.\nTwo cases arise which have to be distinguished. In the first case, the orbits and the spin axes of the electrons in an atom are so oriented that their fields support each other and the atom behaves like a tiny magnet. Substances with such atoms are called paramagnetic substances. In second type of atoms there is no resultant field as the magnetic fields produced by both orbital and spin motions of the electrons might add upto zero. These are called diamagnetic substances, for example the atoms of water, copper, bismuth and antimony.\nHowever, there are some solid substances e.g., $\\mathrm{Fe}, \\mathrm{Co}, \\mathrm{Ni}$, Chromium dioxide, and Alnico (an iron aluminium - nickel - cobalt alloy) in which the atoms co-operate with each other in such a way so as to exhibit a strong magnetic effect. They are called ferromagnetic substances. Ferromagnetic materials are of great interest for electrical engineers.\nRecent studies of ferromagnetism have shown that there exists in ferromagnetic substance small regions called 'domains'. The domains are of macroscopic size of the order\n\nof millimetres or less but large enough to contain $10^{12}$ to $10^{14}$ atoms. Within each domain the magnetic fields of all the spinning electrons are parallel to one another i.e., each domain is magnetized to saturation. Each domain behaves as a small magnet with its own north and south poles. In unmagnetised iron the domains are oriented in a disorderly fashion (Fig.17.16), so that the net magnetic effect of a sizeable specimen is zero. When the specimen is placed in an external magnetic field as that of a solenoid, the domains line up parallel to lines of external magnetic field and the entire specimen becomes saturated (Fig.17.17). The combination of a solenoid and a specimen of iron inside it thus makes a powerful magnet and is called an electromagnet.\nIron is a soft magnetic material. Its domains are easily oriented on applying an external field and also readily return to random positions when the field is removed. This is desirable in an electromagnet and also in transformers. Domains in steel, on the other hand, are not so easily oriented to order. They require very strong external fields, but once oriented, retain the alignment. Thus steel makes a good permanent magnet and is known as hard magnetic material and another such material is a special alloy Alnico V.\nFinally, it must be mentioned that thermal vibrations tend to disturb the orderliness of the domains. Ferromagnetic materials preserve the orderliness at ordinary temperatures. When heated, they begin to lose their orderliness due to the increased thermal motion. This process begins to occur at a particular temperature (different for different materials) called Curie temperature. Above the Curie temperature iron is paramagnetic but not ferromagnetic. The Curie temperature for iron is about $750^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\n## Hysteresis Loop\n\nTo investigate a ferromagnetic material, a bar of that material such as iron is placed in an alternating current solenoid. When the alternating current is at its positive peak value, it fully magnetises the specimen in one direction and when the current is at its negative peak, it fully magnetises it in opposite direction. Thus as the alternating current changes from its positive peak value to its negative peak value and then back to its positive peak value, the specimen undergoes a complete cycle of magnetization. The flux density versus the magnetization current of the specimen for the various values of magnetizing current of the solenoid is plotted by a CRO (Fig.17.18).\nFig. 17.16 Magnetic domains within an unmagnetized ferromagnet.\nFig. 17.17\n\n## Magnetic made out of organic materials could be used in optical disks and compunents. in computers, mabie ifhines, TVs, motors generators and data storage devices. Circuits can mate use of ceramic mignets that do not conducts execthuty\nFig. 17.18\n\nIts main features are as follows:\n\n# 1. Hysteresis\n\nThe portion of OA of the curve is obtained when the magnetizing current / is increased and AR is the portion when the current is decreased. It may be noted that the value of flux density for any value of current is always greater when the current is decreasing than when it is increasing, i.e., magnetism lags behind the magnetizing current. This phenomenon is known as hysteresis.\n\n## 2. Saturation\n\nThe magnetic flux density increases from zero and reaches a maximum value. At this stage the material is said to be magnetically saturated.\n\n## 3. Remanence or Relantivity\n\nWhen the current is reduced to zero, the material still remains strongly magnetized represented by point $R$ on the curve. It is due to the tendency of domains to stay partly in line, once they have been aligned.\n\n## 4. Coercivity\n\nTo demagnetize the material, the magnetizing current is reversed and increased to reduce the magnetization to zero. This is known as coercive current represented by C on the curve. The coercivity of steel (Fig. 17.19 a), is more than that of iron as more current is needed to demagnetize it. Once the material is magnetized, its magnetization curve never passes through the origin. Instead, it forms the closed loop $\\mathrm{ACDC}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{A}$, which is called hysteresis loop.\n\n## 5. Area of the Loop\n\nThe area of the loop is a measure of the energy needed to magnetize and demagnetize the specimen during each cycle of the magnetizing current. This is the energy required to do work against internal friction of the domains. This work, like all work that is done against friction, is dissipated as heat. It is called hysteresis loss.\nHard magnetic materials like steel can not be easily magnetized or demagnetized, so they have large loop area as compared to soft magnetic material such as iron which can easily be magnetized. The energy dissipated per cycle, thus, for iron is less than for steel.\n(a) Hysteresis loop of steel\n(b) Hysteresis loop of soft iron\n\nOR = Retentivity\nOC = Coercivity\nFig. 17.19\n\nSuitability of magnetic materials for different purposes can be studied by taking the specimen through a complete cycle and drawing the hysteresis loop. A material with high retentivity and large coercive force would be most suitable to make a permanent magnet. The cores of electromagnets used for alternating currents where the specimen repeatedly undergoes magnetization and demagnetization should have narrow hysteresis curves of small area to minimize the waste of energy.\nA bullet train is lifted above the rails due to magnetic effect, thus friction is reduced to minimum and speed can be enhanced up to $500 \\mathrm{~kmh}^{2}$.\n\n# SUMMARY\n\n- $\\quad$ Crystalline solids are those in which there is a regular arrangement of molecules. The neighbours of every molecule are arranged in a regular pattern that is constant through out the crystal. Thus, there is an ordered structure in crystalline solids.\n- In amorphous solids there is no regular arrangement of molecules. These are more like liquids with the disordered structure frozen in.\n- Polymers may be said to be more or less solid materials with a structure that is intermediate between order and disorder. These can be classified as partially or poorly crystalline solids.\n- A crystalline solid consists of three dimensional pattern that repeats itself over and over again.

Silicon is one of the most commonly used semi-conductors, and is the basic material from which highly sophisticated integrated circuits known as 'chips' are made. The use of chips in analogue as well as in digital electronics is described in the form of the black boxes. This chapter is based on the preliminary concepts introduced in the secondary school physics course.\n\n### 18.1 BRIEF REVIEW OF p-n JUNCTION AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS\n\nA p-n junction is formed when a crystal of germanium or silicon is grown in such a way that its one half is doped with a trivalent impurity and the other half with a pentavalent impurity. One of the most important building blocks of electronic devices is the p-n junction. Its n-region contains free electrons as majority charge carriers and p-region contains holes as majority charge carriers. Just after the formation of the junction, the free electrons in the n-region, because of their random motion, diffuse into the p-region. As a result of this diffusion, a region is formed around the junction in which charge carriers are not present. This region is known as depletion region (Fig. 18.1 a). In this figure, blue dots represent the free electrons and the small circles show the holes whereas the circles with + and - signs show the positive and negative ions which constitute the depletion region. Due to charge on\n\nthese ions a potential difference develops across the depletion region (Fig. 18.1 b). Its value is 0.7 V in case of silicon and 0.3 V in case of germanium. This potential difference, called potential barrier, stops further diffusion of electrons into the p-region.\n\n# Forward Biased p-n Junction\n\nWhen an external potential difference is applied across a p-n junction such that p -side is positive and n -side is negative, then this external potential difference supplies energy to free electrons in the n-region and to holes in p-region. When this energy is sufficient to overcome the potential barrier, a current of the order of a few miliamperes begins to flow across the p-n junction. In this state the p-n junction is said to be forward biased (Fig. 18.2 a). The variation of current through the junction with the bias voltage can be studied by the circuit shown in Fig. 18.2 (b). The value of current for different values of bias voltage is noted and a current-bias voltage graph is plotted. Fig. 18.3 shows the graph for a typical low power silicon diode.\nAs shown in Fig.18.3, if forward bias voltage is increased by $\\Delta V_{n}$ the current increases by $\\Delta I_{r}$. The ratio $\\Delta V_{r} / \\Delta I_{r}$ is known as forward resistance of the p-n junction, i.e.,\n\n$$\nr_{r}=\\frac{\\Delta V_{L}}{\\Delta I_{r}}\n$$\n\nIt is the resistance offered by the p-n junction when it is conducting. The value of $r_{r}$ is only a few ohms.\n\n## Reverse Biased p-n Junction\n\nWhen the external source of voltage is applied across a p-n junction such that its positive terminal is connected to nregion and its negative terminal to p-region, the p-n junction is said to be reverse biased (Fig. 18.4). In this situation no current flows due to the majority charge carries. However a very small current, of the order of few microamperes flows across the junction due to flow of minority charge carriers (Fig.18.4). It is known as reverse current or leakage current. The variation of reverse current with the applied bias voltage can be studied by the circuit shown in Fig.18.5. Fig. 18.6 shows the reverse characteristic for the p-n junction. It can be seen that as the reverse voltage is increased from 0 , the reverse current quickly rises to its saturation value $I_{s}$. As the reverse voltage is further increased, the reverse current\nFig. 18.4. Under a reversed biased condition there is almost no current through the diode.\nremains almost constant. Here the resistance offered by the diode is very high - of the order of several mega ohms.\nAs the reverse voltage is increased, the kinetic energy of the minority charge carriers with which they cross the depletion region also increases till it is sufficient to break a covalent bond. As the covalent bond breaks, more electron-hole pairs are created. Thus, minority charge carriers begin to multiply due to which the reverse current begin to increase till a point is reached when the junction breaks down and reverse current rises sharply (Fig.18.6). After breakdown the reverse current will rise to very high value which will damage the junction.\nP-n junction is also known as a semi-conductor diode whose symbolic representation is given in Fig. 18.7. The arrow head represents the $p$ - region and is known as anode. The vertical line represents the n-region and is known as cathode. The current flows in the direction of arrow when the diode is forward biased.\n\n# 18.2 RECTIFICATION\n\nConversion of alternating current into direct current is called rectification. Semi-conductor diodes are extensively used for this purpose. There are two very common types of rectification.\n(i) Half-wave rectification and\n(ii) Full-wave rectification\n\n## Half-Wave Rectification\n\nA half-wave rectification is shown in Fig. 18.8 where an alternating voltage of period $T$ called input voltage is applied to a diode $D$ which is connected in series with a load resistance $R$. In this method only one half of alternating current cycle is converted into direct current.\nDuring the positive half cycle of the input alternating voltage i.e., during the interval $0 \\rightarrow T / 2$, the diode $D$ is forward biased, so it offers a very low resistance and current flows through $R$. The flow of current through $R$ causes a potential drop across it which varies in accordance with the alternating input (Fig. 18.8 c ).\nDuring the negative half cycle i.e., during the period $T / 2 \\rightarrow T$, the diode is reverse biased. Now it offers a very high resistance, so practically no current flows through $R$ and potential drop across it is almost zero (Fig. 18.8 c). The same events repeat during the next cycle and so on. The current through $R$ flows in only one direction which means it is a direct current. However, this current flows in pulses (Fig. 18.8 c). The\n\nvoltage which appears across load resistance $R$ is known as output voltage.\n\n# Full-Wave Rectification\n\nWe have seen that in a half-wave rectification, only one half of the alternating input voltage is used to send a unidirectional current through a resistance. However both halves of the input voltage cycle can be utilized using full-wave rectification. Its circuit consists of four diodes connected in a bridge type arrangement (Fig.18.9). To understand the operation of the circuit, recall that a diode conducts only when it is forward biased. During the positive half cycle, i.e., during the time $0 \\rightarrow T / 2$, the terminal $A$ of the bridge is positive with respect to its other terminal $B$. Now the diodes $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$, become forward biased and conduct. A current flows through the circuit in the direction shown by arrows in Fig. 18.9 (a). During the negative half cycle, i.e., during the time interval $T / 2 \\rightarrow T$, terminal $A$ is negative and $B$ is positive. Now the diodes $D_{4}$ and $D_{3}$ conduct and current flows through the circuit in the path shown by arrows in Fig. 18.9 (b). By comparing Figs. 18.9 (a) and 18.9 (b), it can be seen that direction of current flow through the load resistance $R$ is the same in both the halves of the cycle. Thus both halves of the alternating input voltage send a unidirectional current through $R$. The input and output voltages are shown in Fig. 18.10. However the output voltage is not smooth but pulsating. It can be made smooth by using a circuit known as filter.\n\n### 18.3 SPECIALLY DESIGNED p-n JUNCTIONS\n\nIn addition to the use of semi-conductor diode as rectifier, many types of p-n junctions have been developed for special purposes. Three most commonly used such diodes are\n(i) Light emitting diode\n(ii) Photo diode\n(iii) Photo voltaic cell\n\n## Light Emitting Diode\n\nLight emitting diodes (LED) are made from special semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide and gallium arsenide phosphide in which the potential barrier between $p$ and $n$ sides is such that when an electron combines with a hole during forward bias conduction, a photon of visible light is emitted. These diodes are commonly used as small light\nFig. 18.9\nFig. 18.10\n\nA seven segment display 0123456789\n\nFig. 18.11\nsources. A specially formed array of seven LED's is used for displaying digits etc., in electronic appliances (Fig. 18.11).\n\n## Photo Diode\n\nPhoto diode is used for the detection of light. It is operated in the reverse biased condition (Fig. 18.12 a). A photo diode symbol is shown in Fig. 18.12 (b). When no light is incident\n(a)\n(b)\non the junction, the reverse current / is almost negligible but when its p-n junction is exposed to light, the reverse current increases with the intensity of light (Fig.18.12 c).\nA photo diode can turn its current ON and OFF in nano-seconds. Hence it is one of the fastest photo detection devices. Applications of photo diode include\ni. Detection of both visible and invisible radiations\nii. Automatic switching\niii. Logic circuits\niv. Optical communication equipment etc.\n\n## Photo-Voltaic Cell\n\nIt consists of a thick n-type region covered by a thin p-type layer. When such a p-n junction having no external bias (Fig.18.13), is exposed to light, absorbed photons generate electron-hole pairs. It results into an increase percentage of minority charge carriers in both the $p$ and $n$-regions and when they diffuse close to the junction, the electric field due to junction potential barrier sweeps them across the junction. It causes a current flow through the external circuit $R$. The current is proportional to intensity of light.\n\n# 18.4 TRANSISTORS\n\nA transistor consists of a single crystal of germanium or silicon which is grown in such a way that it has three regions (Figs. 18.14 \\& 18.15).\nIn Fig. 18.14 the central region is $p$ type which is sandwiched between two $n$ type regions. It is known as $n-p-n$ transistor. In Fig.18.15, the $n$ type central region is sandwiched between two $p$ type regions. It forms a p-n-p transistor. The central region is known as base and the other two regions are called emitter and collector. Usually the base is very thin, of the order of $10^{-5} \\mathrm{~m}$. The emitter and collector have greater concentration of impurity. The collector is comparatively larger than the emitter. The emitter has greater concentration of impurity as compared to the collector.\n\nIt can be seen in Figs. 18.14 and 18.15 that a transistor is a combination of two back to back p-n junctions: emitter-base junction and collector-base junction.\nFor normal operation of the transistor, batteries $V_{B B}$ and $V_{c c}$ are connected in such a way that its emitter-base junction is forward biased and its collector base junction is reverse biased. $V_{c c}$ is of much higher value than $V_{B B}$. Fig. 18.16 shows the biasing arrangement for $n-p-n$ transistor when the transistor has been represented by its symbolic form. Fig. 18.17 shows the same for a p-n-p transistor.\nFig. 18.14\nFig. 18.15\nFig. 18.15\n\nFig. 18.17\nIt may be noted that polarities of the biasing batteries $V_{B B}$ and $V_{c c}$ are opposite in the two types of the transistors. In actual practice, it is the n-p-n transistor that is generally used. So we will discuss n-p-n transistors only.\n\n# Current Flow in a n-p-n Transistor\n\nFig. 18.18 (a) shows a n-p-n transistor at the instant when the biasing voltage is applied. Electrons in the emitter, shown by black dots, have not yet entered the base region. After the application of the biasing voltage, emitter base junction is forward biased, so emitter injects a large number of electrons in base region (Fig. 18.18 b). These free electrons in the base can flow in either of two directions. They can either flow out of the base to the positive terminal of $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{pp}}$ or they can be attracted towards the collector because of battery $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{cc}}$. Since the base is extremely thin, very few electrons manage to recombine with holes and escape out of the base. Almost all of the free electrons injected from the emitter into the base are attracted by the collector due to the large positive potential $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{cc}}$ (Fig. 18.18 c ). Thus, in a normally biased transistor due to above mentioned flow of electrons, we can say, that an electronic current $I_{e}$, flows from the emitter into the base. A very small part of it, current $I_{b}$, flows out of the base, the rest of it $I_{c}$ flows out of the collector (Fig. 18.19).\nFig. 18.19\n\nThe flow of conventional current is shown in Fig. 18.20. In future we will use conventional current only. From the figure, it can be seen that\n\n$$\nI_{c}=I_{c}+I_{a}\n$$\n\nAs very few electrons flow out of base, so $I_{B}$ is very small as compared to $I_{c}$.\nIt is also found that for a given transistor the ratio of collector current $I_{c}$ to base current $I_{b}$ is nearly constant i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\beta=\\frac{I_{c}}{I_{B}}\n$$\n\nThe ratio $\\beta$ is called current gain of transistor. Its value is quite large - of the order of hundreds. Eqs. 18.2 and 18.3 are\n\nfundamental equations of all transistors.\nExample 18.1: In a certain circuit, the transistor has a collector current of 10 mA and a base current of $40 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$. What is the current gain of the transistor?\n\n# Solution:\n\n$$\n\\beta=\\frac{I_{0}}{I_{B}}=\\frac{10 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~A}}{40 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~A}}=250\n$$\n\n### 18.5 TRANSISTOR AS AN AMPLIFIER\n\nIn majority of electronic circuits, transistors are basically used as amplifiers. An amplifier is thus the building block of every complex electronic circuit. It is for this reason that study of transistor amplifier is important.\n\nThe circuit in Fig. 18.21 is a transistor voltage amplifier. The battery $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ forward biases the base-emitter junction and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CC}}$ reverse biases the collector-base junction. $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ and $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ are the input and output voltages respectively. The base current is $I_{B}=V_{B E} / r_{i e}$ where $r_{i e}$ is base emitter resistance of the transistor. The transistor amplifies it $\\beta$ times. So\n\n$$\nI_{0}=\\beta I_{B}=\\beta V_{B E} / r_{i e}\n$$\n\nThe output voltage $V_{O}=V_{C E}$ is determined by applying KVL equation in the output loop which gives\n\n$$\nV_{C C}=I_{C} R_{C}+V_{C E} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad V_{C E}=V_{C C}-I_{C} R_{C}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the value of $I_{0}$ and replacing by $V_{C E}$ by $V_{0}$\n\n$$\nV_{0}=V_{C C}-\\beta V_{B E} R_{C} / r_{i e}\n$$\n\nWhen small signal voltage $\\Delta V_{\\text {in }}$ is applied at the input terminal B, the input voltage changes from $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}$ to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{BE}}+\\Delta \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{in}}$. This causes a little change in base current from $I_{B}$ to $\\left(I_{B}+\\Delta I_{B}\\right)$ due to which the collector current changes from $I_{C}$ to $\\left(I_{C}+\\Delta I_{C}\\right)$. As the collector current changes, the voltage drop across $R_{C}$ i.e., $\\left(I_{C} R_{C}\\right)$ also changes due to which the output voltage $V_{0}$ changes by $\\Delta V_{0}$. Substituting the changed values in Eq. 18.4(a)\n\n$$\nV_{0}+\\Delta V_{0}=V_{C C}-\\beta\\left(V_{B E}+\\Delta V_{B}\\right) R_{C} / r_{i e}\n$$\n\nSubtracting Eq. 18.4(a) from Eq. 18.4(b)\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{0}=-\\beta \\Delta V_{b} R_{C} / r_{i e}\n$$\n\nFig. 18.21\n\nTherefore the gain of the amplifier $A=\\Delta V_{0} / V_{m}=\\beta R_{C} / r_{i e}$ The value of the factor $\\beta R_{C} / r_{i e}$ is of the order of hundreds, so the input voltage is amplified. The negative sign shows that there is a phase shift of $180^{\\circ}$ between the input and the output signals.\n\n# 18.6 TRANSISTORASASWITCH\n\nFig. 18.22 (a) shows the circuit in which a transistor is used as a switch. The collectors $C$ and emitter $E$ behave as the terminals of the switch. The circuit in which the current is to be turned OFF and ON, is connected across these terminals. The base $B$ and emitter $E$ act as control terminals which decide the state of the switch.\nIn order to turn on the switch, a potential $V_{B}$ is applied between control terminals B-E (Fig. 1822 a). This injects a large current $I_{B}$ into the base circuit due to which a very heavy current $I_{C}$ begins to flow in the CE circuit. This large value of collector current is possible only when the resistance between $C$ and $E$ drops down to such a small value that the potential drop across CE is nearly 0.1 volt. In Fig. 18.22 (a) emitter is at ground, so we can assume that collector is also at ground and collector emitter circuit of Fig. 18.22 (a) can be drawn as shown in Fig. 18.22 (b). CE switch is closed and the bulb glows due to flow of large collector current. To turn the switch OFF the base current $I_{B}$ is set zero by opening the base circuit (Fig. 18.22 c). As $I_{C}=\\beta I_{B}$, so $I_{C}$ becomes zero and C-E circuit becomes open (Fig. 18.22 d) Now the resistance between $C$ and $E$ becomes nearly infinity which opens the CE switch.\nAn electronic computer is basically a vast arrangement of electronic switches which are made from transistors.\n\n### 18.7 OPERATIONALAMPLIFIER\n\nAs stated earlier, amplifier is an important electronic circuit that is used in almost every electronic instrument. So instead of making amplifier circuit by discrete components, the whole amplifier is integrated on a small silicon chip and enclosed in a capsule. Pins connected with working terminals such as input, output and power supply project outside the capsule (Fig. 18.23 a). The enclosed circuit of the amplifier is used by making requisite connections with these pins. Such as\n\nintegrated amplifier is known as operational amplifier (op-amp), as it is some times used to perform mathematical operations electronically.\nThe op-amp is usually represented by its symbol shown in Fig. 18.23 (b). It has two input terminals. One is known as inverting input (-) and the other non-inventing input (+). A signal that is applied at the inverting (-) input, appears after amplification, at the output terminal with a phase shift of $180^{\\circ}$ (Fig. 18.24 a). It can be seen that the signal is inverted as it appears at the output. This is why this terminal is known as inverting. If the signal is applied at non-inverting input ( + ), it is amplified at the output without any change of phase (Fig. 18.24 b).\nFig. 18.24\nFig. 18.24\nFig. 18.25\nFig. 18.26\n\n# (ii) Output\n\nIt is the resistance between the output terminal and ground (Fig. 18.26). Its value is only a few ohms.\n\n## (iii) Open Loop Gain\n\nIt is the ratio of output voltage $V_{0}$ to the voltage difference between non-inverting and inverting inputs when there is no external connection between the output and the inputs (Fig. 18.27) i.e.,\n\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{OL}}=\\frac{V_{0}}{V_{0}-V_{-}}=\\frac{V_{0}}{V_{1}}\n$$\n\nFig. 18.28\n\nThe open loop gain of the amplifier is very high. It is of the order of $10^{5}$.\n\n# 18.8 OP-AMP AS INVERTING AMPLIFIER\n\nFig. 18.28 shows the circuit of an op-amp when used as an inverting amplifier. The input signal $V_{i n}$ which is to be amplified, is applied at inverting terminal (-) through a resistance $R_{1}, V_{n}$ is its output. The non-inverting terminal ( + ) is grounded, i.e., its potential is zero. We know that $A_{0 k}$ is $V_{n}$ very high, of the order of $10^{5}$. As $V_{n}$ may have any value between $+V_{c c}(+12 \\mathrm{~V})$ and $-V_{c c}(-12 \\mathrm{~V})$ so according to Eq.18.5, for finite ( $\\pm 12 \\mathrm{~V}$ ) value of $V_{n}, V_{n}-V_{n}=0$ or $V_{n}=V_{n}$. Since $V_{n}$ is at ground so $V_{1}$ is virtually at ground potential i.e., $V_{1}=0$. Referring to Fig. 18.28,\n\nCurrent through $\\quad R_{1}=I_{1}=\\frac{V_{m}-V_{1}}{R_{1}}=\\frac{V_{m}-0}{R_{1}}=\\frac{V_{m}}{R_{1}}$\nCurrent through $\\quad R_{2}=I_{2}=\\frac{V_{-}-V_{n}}{R_{2}}=\\frac{0-V_{n}}{R_{2}}=-\\frac{V_{n}}{R_{2}}$\nAs practically no current flows between $(-)$ and $(+)$ terminals, so according to Kirchhoff's current rule $\\quad I_{1}=I_{2}$ or\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{m}}{R_{1}}=-\\frac{V_{n}}{R_{2}} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\frac{V_{n}}{V_{m}}=-\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\n$$\n\nAs $V_{0} / V_{m}$ is defined as gain $G$ of the inverting amplifier, so\n\n$$\nG=-\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\n$$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the output signal is $180^{\\circ}$ out of phase with respect to input signal. It is interesting to note that the closed loop gain depends upon the two externally connected resistances $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. The gain is independent of what is happening inside the amplifier.\nIf $R_{1}=10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ and $R_{2}=100 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$, the gain of the amplifier is\n\n$$\nG=\\frac{V_{m}}{V_{m}}=\\frac{-R_{2}}{R_{1}}=\\frac{-100 \\Omega}{10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega}=-10\n$$\n\n### 18.9 OP-AMP AS NON-INVERTING AMPLIFIER\n\nThe circuit diagram of op-amp as non-inverting amplified is shown in Fig. 18.29. In this case the input signal $V_{n}$ is applied at the non-inverting terminal ( + ). As explained earlier, due to high open loop gain of amplifier, the inverting (-) and non\n\ninverting ( + ) inputs are virtually at the same potential. That is,\n\n$$\nV_{+}=V_{+}=V_{\\text {in }}\n$$\n\nAlso, from Fig.18.29,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Current through } R_{1}=I_{1}=\\frac{0-V_{-}}{R_{1}}=\\frac{0-V_{0}}{R_{1}}=\\frac{-V_{\\text {in }}}{R_{1}} \\\\\n& \\text { Current through } R_{2}=I_{2}=\\frac{V_{-}-V_{0}}{R_{2}}=\\frac{V_{0}-V_{0}}{R_{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs practically no current flows between (-) and (+) terminals, so by Kirchhoff's current rule\n\n$$\nI_{1}=I_{2}\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\n\\frac{-V_{0}}{R_{1}}=\\frac{V_{0}-V_{0}}{R_{2}}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nV_{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\\frac{1}{R_{2}}\\right)=\\frac{V_{0}}{R_{2}}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\text { Gain }=\\frac{V_{0}}{V_{\\text {in }}}=1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\n$$\n\nAgain the gain of the amplifier is independent of the internal structure of the op-amp. It just depends upon the two externally connected resistances $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. The positive sign of gain indicates that the input and out put signals are in phase.\nExample 18.2: Find the gain of the circuit as shown in Fig.18.30.\n\n## Solution:\n\nAs the input signal $V_{\\text {in }}$ is connected to non-inverting input $(+)$, so the op-amp acts as a non-inverting amplifier. Comparing it with the circuit of non-inverting amplifier as shown in Fig. 18.29, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR_{1} & =\\text { infinity } \\\\\n\\therefore \\quad \\text { Gain } & =1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}=1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand\n\n## 18.10 OP-AMP AS A COMPARATOR\n\nOp-amp usually requires two power supplies of equal voltage but of opposite polarity. Most op-amp operate with $V_{\\mathrm{CC}}= \\pm 12 \\mathrm{~V}$ supply (Fig. 18.31).\n\n## An op amplifier - The circuits in the black box.\nFig. 18.30\nFig. 18.31\n\nIntegrated circuit (IC) chips are manufactured on wafers of semiconductor material.\nFig. 18.33\n\nAs the open loop gain of the op-amp is very high ( $10^{7}$ ), even a very small potential difference between the inverting and noninverting inputs is amplified to such a large extent that the amplifier gets saturated, i.e., its output either becomes equal to $+V_{\\mathrm{cc}}$ or $-V_{\\mathrm{cc}}$. This feature of op-amp is used to compare two voltages. Fig. 18.32 shows the circuit of an op-amp used as\nFig. 18.32\ncomparator. $V_{R}$ is reference voltage which is connected with $(+)$ terminal and $V$ is the voltage which is to be compared with the reference $V_{R}$. It is connected with (-) terminal.\nWhen\n$V_{1}>V_{1}$ or $V>V_{R}$, then $V_{1}=-V_{c c}$\nand if\n$V_{1}<V_{1}$ or $V<V_{R}$, then $V_{1}=+V_{c c}$\n\n### 18.11 COMPARATOR AS A NIGHT SWITCH\n\nSuppose it is required that when intensity of light falls below a certain level, the street light is automatically switched on. This can be accomplished by using op-amp as a comparator. In Fig. 18.33 resistances $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ form a potential divider. The potential drop across $R_{2}$ provides the reference voltage $V_{R}$ to the $(+)$ input of the op-amp. Thus\n\n$$\nV_{R}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \\times V_{C C}\n$$\n\nLDR is a light dependent resistance. The value of its resistance $R_{L}$ depends upon the intensity of light falling upon it. $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ form another potential divider. The potential drop across $R_{3}$ is $V^{\\prime}$ which is given by\n\n$$\nV^{\\prime}=\\frac{R_{3}}{R_{L}+R_{3}} \\times V_{C C}\n$$\n\n$V^{\\prime}$ provides the voltage to (-) input of the op-amp. $V^{\\prime}$ will not be\n\na constant voltage but it will vary with the intensity of light. During day time, when light is falling upon LDR, $R_{L}$ is small. According to Eq.18.9, $V^{\\prime}$ will be large such that $V^{\\prime}>V_{0}$ so that $V_{0}=-V_{c c}$. The output of the op is connected with a relay system which energizes only when $V_{0}=+V_{c c}$ and then it turns on the street lights. Thus when $V_{0}=-V_{c c}$, the light will not be switched ON.\n\nAs it gets darker, $R_{L}$ becomes larger and $V^{\\prime}$ decreases. When $V^{\\prime}$ becomes just less than $V_{0}$, the output of op-amp switches to $+V_{c c}$ which energizes the relay system and the street lights are turned ON.\n\n# 18.12 DIGITAL SYSTEMS\n\nA digital system deals with quantities or variables which have only two discrete values or states. Following are the examples of such quantities.\n(i) A switch can be either open or closed.\n(ii) The answer of a question can be either yes or no.\n(iii) A certain statement can be either true or false.\n(iv) A bulb can be either off or on.\n\nVarious designations are used to represent the two quantized states of such quantities. The most common of these are listed in Table 18.1.\n\n| Table 18.1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| One of the states | True | High | 1 | Yes | On | Closed |\n| The other state | False | Low | 0 | No | Off | Open |\n\nMathematical manipulation of these quantities can be best carried if they are represented by binary digits 1 and 0 . When we are dealing with voltages, designation No. 2 is also a convenient representation.\nIn describing functions of digital systems a closed switch will be shown as 1 and open switch will be shown as 0 . Similarly, a lighted bulb will be described as 1 and an off bulb will be described as 0 .\nJust as we require two basic mathematical operations, i.e., addition and subtraction for the mathematical manipulation\n\nFig. 18.34\nFig. 18.35\n\n| Table 18.2 |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| A | B | Output |\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nFig. 18.36\n| Table 18.3 |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| A | B | Output |\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nof ordinary quantities which can possess all continuous values, we require a special algebra, known as Boolean algebra for the manipulation of the quantities which have values 1 and 0 , now designated as Boolean variables. Boolean algebra is based upon three basic operations namely (i) AND operation, (ii) OR operation and (iii) NOT operation. You have already read about these operations. Here we would study about logic gates which implement these operations.\n\n# 18.13 FUNDAMENTAL LOGIC GATES\n\nThe electronic circuits which implement the various logic operations are known as logic gates. In these gates the high and low states, i.e., 1 and 0 states are simulated by certain voltage levels. Ideally one particular voltage level represents a high (1) and another voltage level represents a low (0). In practical digital circuits, however a 1 or high can be any voltage between a specified minimum value and a specified maximum value. Likewise 0 or low can be any voltage between a specified minimum and a specified maximum. Fig. 18.34 shows the range 1 and 0 levels for a certain type of digital gates. Thus if voltage of 3.5 V is applied to a gate, it will accept it as high or 1 . If a voltage of 0.5 V is applied, the gate will recognize it as 0 or low.\n\n## OR Gate\n\nOR gate as symbolically represented in Fig.18.35, implements the logic of OR operation. It has two or more inputs and a single output $X$. The output has a value 1 when at least one of its inputs $A$ and $B$ is at 1 . Thus $X$ will be zero only when both the inputs are 0 . Thus it implements the truth table of OR operation (Table 18.2). The mathematical notation for OR operation is\n\n$$\nX=A+B\n$$\n\n## AND Gate\n\nThe AND gate shown in Fig. 18.36 has two or more inputs and a single output. It is designed such that it implements the truth table of AND operation, i.e., its output $X$ is 1 only when both of its inputs $A$ and $B$ are at 1 and for all other combinations of the values of $A$ and $B, X$ is zero (Table 18.3). The mathematical notation for AND operation is\n\n$$\nX=A \\cdot B\n$$\n\n## NOT Gate\n\nIt performs the operation of inversion or complementation. That is why it is also known as inverter. It changes a logic level to its opposite level, i.e., it changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1 . The symbolic representation of NOT gate is shown in Fig. 18.37. Whenever a bar is placed on any variable, it shows that the value of the variable has been inverted. For example $\\overline{1}=0$ and $\\overline{0}=1$. The \"bubble\" (o) in Fig. 18.37 indicates operation of inversion. Its truth table is given in Table 18.4. The mathematical notation for NOT operation is $\\quad X=\\bar{A}$\n\n### 18.14 OTHER LOGIC GATES\n\n## NOR Gate\n\nIn NOR gate the output of OR gate is inverted. Its symbol is shown in Fig. 18.38 and its truth table is given in Table 18.5. The mathematical notation for NOR operation is\n\n$$\nX=\\overline{A+B}\n$$\n\n## NAND Gate\n\nIn NAND gate the output of an AND gate is inverted. Its symbol is shown in Fig. 18.39. The bubble in this figure shows that the output of AND gate is inverted. The truth table implemented by it is shown in Table 18.6. The mathematical notation for NAND operation is\n\n$$\nX=\\bar{A} \\cdot \\bar{B}\n$$\n\n## Exclusive OR Gate(XOR)\n\nConsider a Boolean function $X$ of two variables $A$ and $B$ such that\n\n$$\nX=A \\bar{B}+\\bar{A} B\n$$\n\nThe first term of the function $X$ is obtained by ANDing the variable $A$ with NOT of $B$. The second term is NOT of $A$ ANDed with B. The function $X$ is obtained by ORing these two terms. It can be constructed by combining AND, OR and NOT gates according to the scheme shown in Fig. 18.40(a). The\nFig. 18.40 (a)\nMaking an XOR gate\n| Table 18.4 |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| A | Output |  |\n| 0 | 1 |  |\n| 1 | 0 |  |\n\n| Table 18.5 |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| A | B | Output |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 |\n\n| Input A |  | Output |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Input B |  |  |\n| NAND gate |  |  |\n| Fig. 18.39 |  |  |\n| Table 18.6 |  |  |\n| A | B | Output |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 |\n\nFig. 18.40 (b)\nFig. 18.41\n\n| Table 18.8 |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| A | B | Output |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nvalue of this function can be obtained by drawing the truth table (Table 18.7) which gives the value of $X$ for all the values of the variables $A$ and $B$. The value of $X$ is 0 when the two inputs have the same values and it is 1 when the inputs have different values. It can be verified that the circuit of Fig. 18.40 (a) implements this truth table. The symbol of XOR gate is shown in Fig. 18.40(b).\n\n## Exclusive-NOR gate (XNOR)\n\nThe exclusive NOR gate is obtained by inverting the output of a XOR gate. Its symbol is shown in Fig. 18.41. The bubble shown at the output in this figure shows that the output of XOR gate has been inverted. So its Boolean expression is given by\n\n$$\nX=\\overrightarrow{A B}+\\overrightarrow{A B}\n$$\n\nThe truth table of XNOR gate is given in the Table 18.8. Its output is 1 when its two inputs are identical and 0 when the two inputs are different. Like XOR gate, it is also constructed by a combination of NOT, AND and NOR gates by the scheme shown in Fig. 18.42.\nFig. 18.42\n\n### 18.15 APPLICATIONS OF GATES IN CONTROL SYSTEMS\n\nGates are widely used in control systems. They control the function of the system by monitoring some physical parameter such as temperature, pressure or some other physical quantity of the system. As gates operate with electrical voltages only, so some devices are required which can convert various physical quantities into electric voltage.\n\nThese devices are known as sensors. For example, in the example of night switch, Light Dependent Resistance (LDR) is a sensor for light because it can convert changes in the intensity of light into electric voltage. A thermister is a sensor for temperature. A microphone is a sound sensor. Similarly there are level sensors which give an electrical signal when the level of liquid in a vessel attains a certain limit. One such application is described here. For example sensors are used to monitor the pressure and temperature of a chemical solution stored in a vat. The circuitry for each sensor is such that it produces a HIGH, i.e., 1 when either the temperature or pressure exceeds a specified value. A circuit is to be designed which will ring an alarm when either the temperature or pressure or both cross the maximum specified limit. The alarm requires a LOW(0) voltage for its activation.\n\nThe block diagram of the problem is shown in Fig. 18.43 in which $C$ is the circuit to be designed. Its inputs $A$ and $B$ are fed by the temperature and pressure sensors $T$ and $P$ fitted into the vat. Whenever output of the circuit $C$ is LOW, the alarm is activated. So the circuit $C$ should be such that its output is 0 as soon as the limit for temperature or pressure is exceeded, i.e., when $A=0, B=1$ or when $A=1, B=0$ or when $A=B=1$. The output of $C$ should be HIGH when temperature and pressure are within the specified limit, i.e., when $A=B=0$. This gives the truth table 18.9 which the circuit $C$ has to implement. It can be seen that it is the truth table of NOR gate. So the circuit $C$ in Fig. 18.43 should be a NOR gate as shown in Fig. 18.44.\nFig. 18.43\n\n| Table 18.9 |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| A | B | C |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 |\n\nFig. 18.44\n\n# GUMMARY\n\nWhen an external potential difference is applied across a p-n junction such that p -side is positive and n -side is negative, it is called forward biased.\n\n- When the external source of voltage is applied across a p-n junction such that its positive terminal is connected to n-region and its negative terminal to p-region, the p-n junction is said to be reverse biased.\n- Conversion of alternating current into direct current is called rectification.\n- When only one half of alternating current cycle is converted into direct current, it is called half-wave rectification.\n- Transistor is a semiconductor device consisting of three electrodes, namely emitter, base and collector. For normal operation, the base-emitter junction is forward biased whereas the collector-base junction is reverse biased.\n\n- Input resistance is the resistance between the positive and negative inputs of the amplifier.\n- Output resistance is the resistance between the output terminal and ground.\n- Instead of making amplifier circuit by discrete components, the whole amplifier is integrated on a small silicon chip and enclosed in a capsule. Pins connected with working terminals such as inputs, outputs and power supply project outside the capsule. Such an integrated amplifier is known as operational amplifier.\n- Open loop gain is the ratio of output voltage and the difference between noninverting and inverting inputs when there is no external connection between the outputs and inputs.\n- A digital system deals with quantities or variables which have only two discrete values or states.\n- The electronic circuits which implement the various logic operations are known as logic gates.\n\n# QUESTIONS\n\n18.1 How does the motion of an electron in a n-type substance differ from the motion of holes in a p-type substance?\n18.2 What is the net charge on a n-type or a p-type substance?\n18.3 The anode of a diode is 0.2 V positive with respect to its cathode.

Understand and describe uncertainty principle.\n\nIn the early part of the twentieth century, many experimental and theoretical problems remained unresolved. Attempts to explain the behaviour of matter on the atomic level with the laws of classical physics were not successful. Phenomena such as black body radiation, the photoelectric effect, the emission of sharp spectral lines by atoms in a gas discharge tube, and invariance of speed of light, could not be understood within the framework of classical physics. To explain these observations a revolutionary framework of explanation was necessary which we call modern physics. Its two most significant features are relativity and quantum theory. The observations on objects moving very fast, approaching the speed of light, are well explained by the special theory of relativity. Quantum theory has been able to explain the behaviour of electromagnetic radiation as discrete packets of energy and the particles on a very small scale are dominated by wave properties.\nClassical physics is still valid in ordinary processes of everyday life. But to explain the behaviour of tiny or very fast moving particles, we have to use the above mentioned theories. In this chapter, we shall discuss various aspects of theory of relativity and quantum\n\ntheory. Before introducing special theory of relativity, some related terms are discussed briefly.\n\n# 19.1 RELATIVE MOTION\n\nWhen we say a ball is thrown up, the 'up' direction is only for that particular place. It will be 'down' position for a person on the diametrically opposite side of the globe. The concept of direction is purely relative. Similarly, the rest position or the motion of an object is not same for different observers. For example, the walls of the cabin of a moving train are stationary with respect to the passengers sitting inside it but are in motion to a person stationary on the ground. So we cannot say whether an object is absolutely at rest or absolutely in motion. All motions are relative to a person or instrument observing it.\nLet us perform an experiment in two cars moving with constant velocities in any direction. Suppose a ball is thrown straight up. It will come back straight down. This will happen in both cars. But if a person in one car observes the experiment done in the other car, will he observe the same? Suppose now one car is stationary. The person in the other car, which is moving with constant velocity, throws a ball straight up. He will receive the ball straight down. On the other hand, the fellow sitting in the stationary car observes that the path of the ball is a parabola. Thus, when experimenters observe what is going on in their own frame of reference, the same experiment gives identical observations. But if they look into other frames, they observe differently.\n\n### 19.2 FRAMES OF REFERENCE\n\nWe have discussed the most commonly used Cartesian coordinate system. In effect, a frame of reference is any coordinate system relative to which measurements are taken. The position of a table in a room can be located relative to the walls of the room. The room is then the frame of reference. For measurements taken in the college laboratory, the laboratory is the reference frame. If the same experiment is performed in a moving train, the train becomes a frame of reference. The position of a spaceship can be described relative to the positions of the distant stars. A coordinate system based on these stars is then the frame of reference.\nAn inertial frame of reference is defined as a coordinate system in which the law of inertia is valid. That is, a body at\n\nrest remains at rest unless an unbalanced force produces acceleration in it. Other laws of nature also apply in such a system. If we place a body upon Earth it remains at rest unless an unbalanced force is applied upon it. This observation shows that Earth may be considered as an inertial frame of reference. A body placed in a car moving with a uniform velocity with respect to Earth also remains at rest, so that car is also an inertial frame of reference. Thus any frame of reference which is moving with uniform velocity relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame.\nWhen the moving car is suddenly stopped, the body placed in it, no longer remains at rest. So is the case when the car is suddenly accelerated. In such a situation, the car is not an inertial frame of reference. Thus an accelerated frame is a non-inertial frame of reference. Earth is rotating and revolving and hence strictly speaking, the Earth is not an inertial frame. But it can often be treated as an inertial frame without serious error because of very small acceleration.\n\n# 19.3 SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY\n\nThe theory of relativity is concerned with the way in which observers who are in a state of relative motion describe physical phenomena. The special theory of relativity treats problems involving inertial or non-accelerating frames of reference. There is another theory called general theory of relativity which treats problems involving frames of reference accelerating with respect to one another. The special theory of relativity is based upon two postulates, which can be stated as follows:\n\n1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.\n2. The speed of light in free space has the same value for all observers, regardless of their state of motion.\nThe first postulate is the generalization of the fact that all physical laws are the same in frames of reference moving with uniform velocity with respect to one another. If the laws of physics were different for different observers in relative motion, the observer could determine from this difference that which of them were stationary in a space and which were moving. But such a distinction does not exist, so this postulate implies that there is no way to detect absolute uniform motion. The second postulate states an experimental fact that speed of light in free space is the universal constant ' $c$ ' ( $c=3 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ ). These simple postulates have far-reaching consequences. These\n\n## The speed of light emitted by flashlight is c measured by two observers, one on the moving track and the other on the road.\n\ninclude such phenomena as the slowing down of clocks and contraction of lengths in moving reference frames as measured by a stationary observer. Some interesting results of the special theory of relativity can be summarized as follows without going into their mathematical derivations.\n\n# Time Dilation\n\nAccording to special theory of relativity, time is not absolute quantity. It depends upon the motion of the frame of reference.\n\nSuppose an observer is stationary in an inertial frame. He measures the time interval between two events in this frame. Let it be $t_{v}$. This is known as proper time. If the observer is moving with respect to frame of events with velocity $v$ or if the frame of events is moving with respect to observer with a uniform velocity $v$, the time measured by the observer would not be $t_{v}$, but it would be $t$ given by\n\n$$\nt=\\frac{t_{v}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\n$$\n\nAs the quantity $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}$ is always less than one, so $t$ is greater than $t_{v}$ i.e., time has dilated or stretched due to relative motion of the observer and the frame of reference of events. This astonishing result applies to all timing processes - physical, chemical and biological. Even aging process of the human body is slowed by motion at very high speeds.\n\n## Length Contraction\n\nThe distance from Earth to a star measured by an observer in a moving spaceship would seem smaller than the distance measured by an observer on Earth. That is, if you are in motion relative to two points that are a fixed distance apart, the distance between the two points appears shorter than if you were at rest relative to them. This effect is known as length contraction. The length contraction happens only along the direction of motion. No such contraction would be observed perpendicular to the direction of motion. The length of an object or distance between two points measured by an observer who is relatively at rest is called proper length ' $l_{v}$ '. If an object and an observer are in relative motion with speed $v$, then the contracted length ' $l$ ' is given by\n\n$$\n\\ell=\\ell_{0} \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\n$$\n\n# Mass Variation\n\nAccording to special theory of relativity, mass of an object is a varying quantity and depends upon the speed of the object. An object whose mass when measured at rest is $m_{n}$ will have an increased mass $m$ when observed to be moving at speed $v$. They are related by\n\n$$\nm=\\frac{m_{n}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\n$$\n\nThe increase in mass indicates the increase in inertia the object has at high speeds. As $v$ approaches $c$, it requires a larger and larger force to change the speed of the object.\nAs $\\quad v \\rightarrow c, \\frac{v}{c} \\rightarrow 1 \\quad$ therefore $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \\rightarrow 0$\nThus\n\n$$\nm \\rightarrow \\infty\n$$\n\nAn infinite mass would require an infinite force to accelerate it. Because infinite forces are not available, hence, an object cannot be accelerated to the speed of light' $c^{\\prime}$ in free space.\nIn our everyday life, we deal with extremely small speeds, compared to the speed of light. Even the Earth's orbital speed is only $30 \\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$. On the other hand, the speed of light in free space is $300,000 \\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$. This is the reason why Newton's laws are valid in everyday situations. However, when experimenting with atomic particles moving with velocities approaching speed of light, the relativistic effects are very prominent, and experimental results cannot be explained without taking Einstein's equations into account.\n\n## Energy $\\cdot$ Mass Relation\n\nAccording to special theory of relativity, mass and energy are different entities but are interconvertible. The total energy $E$ and mass $m$ of an object are related by the expression\n\n$$\nE=m c^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $m$ depends on the speed of the object. At rest, the energy equivalent of an object's mass $m_{n}$ is called rest mass energy $E_{n}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=m_{n} c^{2}\n$$\n\nAs $m c^{2}$ is greater than $m_{n} c^{2}$, the difference of energy $\\left(m c^{2}-m_{n} c^{2}\\right)$ is due to motion, as such it represents the kinetic energy of the mass. Hence\n\n$$\nK . E_{1}=\\left(m-m_{n}\\right) c^{2}\n$$\n\nFrom equation 19.4 above, the change in mass $m$ due to change in energy $\\Delta E$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\Delta m=\\frac{\\Delta E}{c^{2}}\n$$\n\nBecause $c^{2}$ is a very large quantity, this implies that small changes in mass require very large changes in energy. In our everyday world, energy changes are too small to provide measurable mass changes. However, energy and mass changes in nuclear reactions are found to be exactly in accordance with the above mentioned equations.\n\n# NAVSTAR Navigation System\n\nThe results of special theory of relativity are put to practical use even in everyday life by a modern system of navigation satellites called NAVSTAR. The location and speed anywhere on Earth can now be determined to an accuracy of about $2 \\mathrm{cms}^{-1}$. However, if relativity effects are not taken into account, speed could not be determined any closer than about $20 \\mathrm{cms}^{-1}$. Using these results the location of an aircraft after an hour's flight can be predicted to about 50 m as compared to about 760 m determined by without using relativistic effects.\n\nExample 19.1: The period of a pendulum is measured to be 3.0 s in the inertial reference frame of the pendulum. What is its period measured by an observer moving at a speed of 0.95 c with respect to the pendulum?\n\n## Solution:\n\n$$\nt_{n}=3.0 \\mathrm{~s}, \\quad v=0.95 c, t=\\text { ? }\n$$\n\nUsing\n\n$$\nt=\\frac{t_{0}}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}\n$$\n\n$t=\\frac{3.0 \\mathrm{~s}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{(0.95 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}}=\\frac{3.0 \\mathrm{~s}}{\\sqrt{1-(0.95)^{2}}}=9.6 \\mathrm{~s}$\n\nExample 19.2: A bar 1.0 m in length and located along $x$-axis moves with a speed of 0.75 c with respect to a stationary observer. What is the length of the bar as measured by the stationary observer?\n\n# Solution:\n\n$$\n\\ell_{0}=1.0 \\mathrm{~m}, \\quad v=0.75 \\mathrm{c}, \\quad \\ell=\\text { ? }\n$$\n\nUsing\n\n$$\n\\ell=\\ell_{0} \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\ell=1.0 \\mathrm{~m} \\times \\sqrt{1-\\frac{(0.75 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}=1.0 \\mathrm{~m} \\times \\sqrt{1-(0.75)^{2}}=0.66 \\mathrm{~m}\n$$\n\nExample 19.3: Find the mass $m$ of a moving object with speed 0.8 c .\n\n## Solution:\n\nUsing\n\n$$\nm=\\frac{m_{0}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nm=\\frac{m_{0}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{(0.8 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}}=\\frac{m_{0}}{\\sqrt{1-(0.8)^{2}}}=1.67 m_{0}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nm=1.67 m_{0}\n$$\n\n### 19.4 BLACK BODY RADIATION\n\nWhen a body is heated, it emits radiation. The nature of radiation depends upon the temperature. At low temperature, a body emits radiation which is principally of long wavelengths in the invisible infrared region. At high temperature, the proportion of shorter wavelength radiation increases. Furthermore, the amount of emitted radiation is different for different wavelengths. It is of interest to see how the energy is distributed among different wavelengths at various temperatures. For example, when platinum wire is heated, it appears dull red at about $500^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, changes to cherry red at $900^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, becomes orange red at $1100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, yellow at $1300^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and finally white at about $1600^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. This shows that as the temperature is increased, the radiation becomes richer in shorter wavelengths.\nIn order to understand the distribution of radiation emitted from a hot body, we consider a non-reflecting object such as a solid\n(a) Absorption of radiation\n\nFig. 19.1\n\nthat has a hollow cavity within it. It has a small hole and the radiation can enter or escape only through this hole. The inside is blackened with soot to make it as good an absorber and as bad a reflector as possible. The small hole appears black because the radiation that enters is reflected from the inside walls many times and is partly absorbed at each reflection until none remains. Such a body is termed as black body and has the property to absorb all the radiation entering it. A black body is both an ideal absorber (Fig. 19.1 a) and an ideal radiator (Fig. 19.1 b).\n\n# Intensity Distribution Diagram\n\nLummer and Pringsheim measured the intensity of emitted energy with wavelength radiated from a black body at different temperatures by the apparatus shown in Fig.19.2. The amount of radiation emitted with different wavelengths is shown in the form of energy distribution curves for each temperature in the Fig.19.3.\nThese curves reveal the following interesting facts.\n\n1. At a given temperature, the energy is not uniformly distributed in the radiation spectrum of the body.\n2. At a given temperature $T$, the emitted energy has maximum value for a certain wavelength $\\lambda_{\\text {max }}$ and the product $\\lambda_{\\text {max }} \\times$ T remains constant .\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max } \\times T=\\text { Constant }\n$$\n\nThe value of the constant known as Wien's constant is about $2.9 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~K}$. This equation means that as $T$\n\nincreases, $\\lambda_{\\text {max }}$ shifts to shorter wavelength.\n3. For all wavelengths, an increase in temperature causes an increase in energy emission. The radiation intensity increases with increase in wavelengths and at a particular wavelength $\\lambda_{\\text {max }}$, it has a maximum value. With further increase in wavelength, the intensity decreases.\n4 The area under each curve represents the total energy $(E)$ radiated per second per square metre over all wavelengths at a particular temperature. It is found that area is directly proportional to the fourth power of kelvin temperature $T$. Thus\n\n$$\nE \\propto T^{4} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad E=\\sigma_{T}^{4}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma$ is called Stefen's constant. Its value is $5.67 \\times 10^{-6}$ $\\mathrm{Wm}^{-2} \\mathrm{~K}^{+}$and the above relation is known as StefenBoltzmann law.\n\n# Planck's Assumption\n\nElectromagnetic wave theory of radiation cannot explain the energy distribution along the intensity-wavelengths curves. The successful attempts to explain the shape of energy distribution curves gave rise to a new and non-classical view of electromagnetic radiation. In 1900, Max Planck founded a mathematical model resulting in an equation that describes the shape of observed curves exactly. He suggested that energy is radiated or absorbed in discrete packets, called quanta rather than as a continuous wave. Each quantum is associated with radiation of a single frequency. The energy $E$ of each quantum is proportional to its frequency $f$, and\n\n$$\nE=\\mathrm{hf}\n$$\n\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant. Its value is $6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js}$. This fundamental constant is as important in physics as the constant $c$, the speed of light in vacuum.\nMax Planck received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1918 for his discovery of energy quanta.\n\n## The Photon\n\nPlanck suggested that as matter is not continuous but consists of a large number of tiny particles, so is the radiation energy from a source. He assumed that granular nature of\n\nradiation from hot bodies was due to some property of the atoms producing it. Einstein extended his idea and postulated that packets or tiny bundles of energy are integral part of all electromagnetic radiation and that they could not be subdivided. These indivisible tiny bundles of energy he called photons. The beam of light with wavelength $\\lambda$ consists of stream of photons travelling at speed $c$ and carries energy hf. From the theory of relativity momentum $p$ of the photon is related to energy as\n\n$$\nE=p c\n$$\n\nThus $p c=\\mathrm{hf} \\quad$ or $\\quad p=\\frac{\\mathrm{hf}}{c}=\\frac{\\mathrm{h}}{\\lambda}$\nThe table 19.1 relates the quanta emitted in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum with energy. At the high end, $\\gamma$ - radiation with energy $\\sim 1 \\mathrm{MeV}$ is easily detected as quanta by a radiation detector and counter. At the other end, the energy of photon of radio waves is only about $10^{-10} \\mathrm{eV}$. So millions of photons are needed to detect a signal and hence wave properties of radio waves predominate. The quanta are\n\nTable: 19.1 Electromagnetic spectrum\nso close together in energy value that radio waves are detected as continuous radiation.\n\nThe emission or absorption of energy in steps may be extended to include any system such as a mass oscillating on a spring. However, the energy steps are far too small to be detected and so any granular nature is invisible. Quantum effects are only important when observing atomic sized objects, where $h$ is a significant factor in any detectable energy change.\nExample 19.4: Assuming you radiate as does a blackbody at your body temperature about $37^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, at what wavelength do you emit the most energy?\n\n# Solution:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nT=37^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}=310 \\mathrm{~K} \\\\\n\\text { Wien's constant }=2.9 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{mK} \\\\\n\\lambda_{\\max }=? \\\\\n\\text { Using } \\quad \\lambda_{\\max } \\times T=\\text { Constant } \\\\\n\\lambda_{\\max }=\\frac{2.9 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{mK}}{310 \\mathrm{~K}}=9.35 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~m}=9.35 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe radiation lies in the invisible infrared region and is independent of skin colour.\nExample 19.5: What is the energy of a photon in a beam of infrared radiation of wavelength 1240 nm ?\n\n## Solution:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=1240 \\mathrm{~nm} \\quad E=?\n$$\n\nUsing $\\quad E=\\mathrm{h} f=\\frac{\\mathrm{hc}}{\\lambda}$\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js} \\times 3 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{1240 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m}}=1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}\n$$\n\nor $\\quad E=1.0 \\mathrm{eV}$\n\n### 19.5 INTERACTION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION WITH MATTER\n\nElectromagnetic radiation or photons interact with matter in three distinct ways depending mainly on their energy. The three processes are\n\nFig 19.4 Experimental arrangement to observe photoelectric effect.\nFig 19.5 Characteristic curves of photocurrent vs. applied voltage for two intensities of monochromatic light.\nFig 19.2 Characteristic curves of photocurrent vs. applied voltage for light of different frequencies.\n(i) Photoelectric effect\n(ii) Compton effect\n(iii) Pair production\n\n## Photoelectric Effect ${ }^{2} \\cdot 7$\n\nThe emission of electrons from a metal surface when exposed to light of suitable frequency is called the photoelectric effect. The emitted electrons are known as photoelectrons.\n\nThe photoelectric effect is demonstrated by the apparatus shown in Fig. 19.4. An evacuated glass tube $X$ contains two electrodes. The electrode A connected to the positive terminal of the battery is known as anode. The electrode $C$ connected to negative terminal is known as cathode. When monochromatic light is allowed to shine on cathode, it begins to emit electrons. These photoelectrons are attracted by the positive anode and the resulting current is measured by an ammeter. The current stops when light is cut off, which proves, that the current flows because of incident light. This current is, hence, called photoelectric current. The maximum energy of the photoelectrons can be determined by reversing the connection of the battery in the circuit i.e., now the anode A is negative and cathode C is at positive potential. In this condition the photoelectrons are repelled by the anode and the photoelectric current decreases. If this potential is made more and more negative, at a certain value, called stopping potential $V_{0}$, the current becomes zero. Even the electrons of maximum energy are not able to reach collector plate. The maximum energy of photoelectrons is thus\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\max }^{2}=V_{0} e\n$$\n\nwhere $m$ is mass, $v$ is velocity and $e$ is the charge on electron. If the experiment is repeated with light beam of higher intensity, the amount of current increases but the current stops for the same value of $V_{0}$. The Fig. 19.5 shows two curves of photoelectric current as a function of potential $V$ where $I_{2}>I_{1}$. If, however, the intensity is kept constant and experiment is performed with different frequencies of incident light, we obtain the curves shown in Fig.19.6. The current is same but stopping potential is different for each frequency of incident light, which indicates the proportionality of maximum kinetic energy with frequency of light $f$.\n\nThe important results of the experiments are\n\n1. The electrons are emitted with different energies. The maximum energy of photoelectrons depends on the particular metal surface and the frequency of incident light.\n2. There is a minimum frequency below which no electrons are emitted, however intense the light may be. This threshold frequency $f_{0}$ varies from metal to metal.\n3. Electrons are emitted instantaneously, the intensity of light determines only their number.\nThese results could not be explained on the basis of electromagnetic wave theory of light. According to this theory, increasing the intensity of incident light should increase the K.E. of emitted electrons which contradicts the experimental result. The classical theory cannot also explain the threshold frequency of light.\n\n## Explanation on the Basis of Quantum Theory\n\nEinstein extended the idea of quantization of energy proposed by Max Planck that light is emitted or absorbed in quanta, known as photons. The energy of each photon of frequency $f$ as given by quantum theory is\n\n$$\nE=h f\n$$\n\nA photon could be absorbed by a single electron in the metal surface. The electron needs a certain minimum energy called the work function ' $\\Phi$ ' to escape from the metal surface. If the energy of incident photon is sufficient, the electron is ejected instantaneously from the metal surface. A part of the photon energy (work function) is used by the electron to break away from the metal and the rest appears as the kinetic energy of the electron. That is,\nIncident photon energy - Work function = Max. K.E. of photoelectron\nor\n\n$$\nh f-\\Phi=\\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\max }^{2}\n$$\n\nThis is known as Einstein's photoelectric equation.\nWhen $K . E_{\\text {max }}$ of the photoelectron is zero, the frequency $f$ is equal to threshold frequency $f_{0}$, hence the Eq. 19.12 becomes\n\n$$\nh f_{0}-\\Phi=0 \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\Phi=h f_{0}\n$$\n\nHence, we can also write Einstein's photoelectric equation as\n\nFig 19.7 Simple photo-emissive cell\nFig 19.8 Sound track on a film which vanes the intensity of light reaching the photo cell.\nFig. 19.8 Photocell detection circuit for sound track of movies.\n\nIt is to be noted that all the emitted electrons do not possess the maximum kinetic energy, some electrons come straight out of the metal surface and some lose energy in atomic collisions before coming out. The equation 19.14 holds good only for those electrons which come out with full surplus energy.\n\nAlbert Einstein was awarded Nobel Prize in physics in 1921 for his explanation of photoelectric effect.\n\nNote that the phenomenon of photoelectric effect cannot be explained if we assume that light consists of waves and energy is uniformly distributed over its wavefront. It can only be explained by assuming light consists of corpuscles of energy known as photon. Thus it shows the corpuscular nature of light.\n\n## Photocell\n\nA photocell is based on photoelectric effect. A simple photocell is shown in Fig. 19.7. It consists of an evacuated glass bulb with a thin anode rod and a cathode of an appropriate metal surface. The material of the cathode is selected to suit to the frequency range of incident radiation over which the cell is operated. For example sodium or potassium cathode emits electrons for visible light, cesium coated oxidized silver emits electrons for infrared light and some other metals respond to ultraviolet radiation. When photo-emissive surface is exposed to appropriate light (Fig.19.8 a), electrons are emitted and a current flows in the external circuit which increases with the increase in light intensity. The current stops when the light beam is interrupted. The cell has wide range of applications. Some of these are to operate:\n\n1. Security systems\n2. Counting systems\n3. Automatic door systems\n4. Automatic street lighting\n5. Exposure meter for photography\n6. Sound track of movies (Fig. 19.8 b)\n\nExample 19.6: A sodium surface is illuminated with light of wavelength 300 nm .

He measured the wavelength of X-rays scattered at an angel $\\theta$ with the original direction. He found that wavelength $\\lambda_{0}$ of the scattered $X$-rays is larger than the wavelength $\\lambda_{c}$ of the incident $X$-rays. This is known as Compton effect. The increase in wavelength of scattered $X$-rays could not be explained on the basis of classical wave theory. Compton suggested that X-rays consist of photons and in the process of scattering the photons suffer collision with electrons like billiard balls (Fig. 19.9 b \\& c). In this collision, a part of incident photon energy and momentum is transferred to an electron. Applying energy and momentum conservation laws to the process, he derived an expression for the change in wavelength $\\Delta \\lambda$ known as Compton shift for scattering angle $\\theta$ as\n(a)\n\nFig. 19.9 (a) Compton's scattering experiment\n\n(b)\n(c)\n(b) A photon collides with an electron and (c) Both are scattered\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\lambda=\\frac{h}{m_{0} c}(1-\\cos \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere $m_{0}$ is the rest mass of the electron. The factor $\\frac{h}{m_{0} c}$ has dimensions of length and is called Compton wavelength and has the numerical value\n\n$$\n\\frac{h}{m_{0} c}=\\frac{6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js}}{9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 3 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}=2.43 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\n$$\n\nIf the scattered X-ray photons are observed at $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$, the Compton shift $\\Delta \\lambda$ equals the Compton wavelength. The Eq.19.15 was found to be in complete agreement with Compton's experimental result, which again is a striking confirmation of particle like interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter.\n\nArthur Holly Compton was awarded Nobel Prize in physics in 1927 for his discovery of the effect named after him.\n\nExample 19.7: A 50 keV photon is Compton scattered by a quasi-free electron.

A third kind of interaction of very high energy photon such as that of $\\gamma$-rays with matter is pair production in which photon energy is changed into an electron-positron pair. A positron is a particle having mass and charge equal to that of electron but the charge being of opposite nature i.e. positive. The creation of two particles with equal and opposite charges is essential for charge conservation in the universe. The positron is also known as antiparticle of electron or anti-electron. The interaction usually takes place in the electric field in the vicinity of a heavy nucleus as shown in the Fig. 19.10 so that there is a particle to take up recoil energy and momentum is conserved.\nIn the process, radiant energy is converted into matter in accordance with Einstein's equation $E=m c^{2}$, and hence, is also known as materialization of energy. For an electron or positron, the rest mass energy $=m_{e} c^{2}=0.51 \\mathrm{MeV}$. Thus to create the two particles $2 \\times 0.51 \\mathrm{MeV}$ or 1.02 MeV energy is required. For photons of energy greater than 1.02 MeV , the probability of pair production occurrence increases as the energy increases and the surplus energy is carried off by the two particles in the form of kinetic energy. The process can be represented by the equation\nEnergy of photon $=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\\text { Energy required } \\\\ \\text { for pair production }\\end{array}\\right]+\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\\text { Kinetic energy } \\\\ \\text { of the particles }\\end{array}\\right]$\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{h} f=2 m_{0} c^{2}+\\mathrm{K} . \\mathrm{E} .\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-}\\right)+\\mathrm{K} . \\mathrm{E} .\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{+}\\right)\n$$\n\nPair Production\nFig. 19.10\n\n### 19.6 ANNIHILATION OF MATTER\n\nIt is converse of pair production when a positron comes close to an electron they annihilate or destroy each other. The matter of two particles changes into electromagnetic energy producing two photons in the $\\gamma$-rays range.\n\n$$\ne^{-}+e^{+} \\longrightarrow \\gamma+\\gamma\n$$\n\nThe two photons are produced travelling in opposite directions (Fig. 19.11) so that momentum is conserved. Each\n\nphoton has energy 0.51 MeV equivalent to rest mass energy of a particle.\n\nThe existence of positron was predicted by Dirac in 1928 and it was discovered in the cosmic radiation in 1932 by Carl Anderson. It gradually became clear that every particle has a corresponding antiparticle with the same mass and charge (if it is a charged particle) but of opposite sign. Particles and antiparticles also differ in the signs of other quantum numbers that we have not yet discussed. A particle and its antiparticle cannot exist together at one place. Whenever they meet, they annihilate each other. That is, the particles disappear, their combined rest energies appear in other forms. Proton and antiproton annihilation has also been observed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.\n\n# 19.7 WAVE NATURE OF PARTICLES\n\nIt has been observed that light displays a dual nature, it acts as a wave and it acts as a particle. Assuming symmetry in nature, the French physicist, Louis de Broglie proposed in 1924 that particles should also possess wavelike properties. As momentum $p$ of photon is given by equation 19.11.\n\n$$\np=\\frac{\\mathrm{h}}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nde Broglie suggested that momentum of a material particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ should be given by the same expression. Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p=\\frac{\\mathrm{h}}{\\lambda}=m v \\\\\n& \\lambda=\\frac{\\mathrm{h}}{p}=\\frac{\\mathrm{h}}{m v}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength associated with particle waves. Hence an electron can be considered to be a particle and it can also be considered to be a wave. The equation 19.17 is called de Broglie relation.\nAn object of large mass and ordinary speed has such a small wavelength that its wave effects such as interference and diffraction are negligible. For example, a rifle bullet of mass 20 g and flying with speed $330 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ will have a wavelength $\\lambda$ given by\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{\\mathrm{h}}{m v}=\\frac{6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js}}{2 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 330 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}=1 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}\n$$\n\nLight is, in short, the most refined form of matter (Louis de Broglie 1892-1987).\n\nThis wavelength is so small that it is not measurable or detectable by any of its effects.\nOn the other hand for an electron moving with a speed of $1 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$,\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js}}{9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 1 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}=7 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}\n$$\n\nThis wavelength is in the X-rays range. Thus, diffraction effects for electrons are measurable whereas diffraction or interference effects for bullets are not.\n\n# Davisson and Germer Experiment\n\nA convincing evidence of the wave nature of electrons was provided by Clinton J. Davisson and Laster H. Germer. They showed that electrons are diffracted from metal crystals in exactly the same manner as X-rays or any other wave. The apparatus used by them is shown in Fig. 19.12, in which electrons from heated filament are accelerated by an adjustable applied voltage $V$. The electron beam of energy Ve is made incident on a nickel crystal. The beam diffracted from crystal surface enters a detector and is recorded as a current $I$. The gain in $K . E$. of the electron as it is accelerated by a potential $V$ in the electron gun is\ngiven by\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=V e\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nm v^{2}=2 \\mathrm{Ve} ; \\quad m^{2} v^{2}=2 \\mathrm{mVe}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nm v=\\sqrt{2 m V e}\n$$\n\nFrom de Broglie equation\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 m V e}}\n$$\n\nIn one of the experiments, the accelerating voltage $V$ was 54 volts, hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 m V e}}=\\frac{6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js}}{\\sqrt{2 \\times 9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 54 \\mathrm{JC}^{-1} \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}}} \\\\\n\\lambda=1.66 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThis beam of electrons diffracted from crystal surface was obtained for a glancing angle of $65^{\\circ}$. According to Bragg's\nFig. 19.12 Experimental arrangement of Davisson and Germer for electron diffraction.\n\nequation\n\n$$\n2 d \\sin \\theta=m \\lambda\n$$\n\nFor 1st order diffraction $m=1$\nFor nickel\n\n$$\nd=0.91 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\n2 \\times 0.91 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m} \\times \\sin 65^{\\circ}=\\lambda\n$$\n\nwhich gives $\\lambda=1.65 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$\nThus, experimentally observed wavelength is in excellent agreement with theoretically predicted wavelength.\n\nFor Your Information\n(a)\n(b)\n(a) If electrons behaved as discrete particles with no wave properties they would pass through one or the other of the two slits and strike the screen causing it to glow and produce exact images of the slits (b) In reality the screen reveals a pattern of bright and dark fringes similar to light is used and interference occurs between the light waves coming from each slit.\ndiffraction patterns have also been observed with protons, neutrons, hydrogen atoms and helium atoms thereby giving substantial evidence for the wave nature of particles.\n\nFor his work on the dual nature of particles, Prince Louis Victor de Broglie received the 1929 Nobel Prize in physics. Clinton Joseph Davisson and George Paget Thomson shared the Nobel Prize in 1937 for their experimental confirmation of the wave nature of particles.\n\n## Wave Particle Duality\n\nInterference and diffraction of light confirm its wave nature, while photoelectric effect proves the particle nature of light. Similarly, the experiments of Davisson and Germer and G. P. Thomson reveal wave like nature of electrons and in the experiment of J. J. Thomson to find e/m we had to assume particle like nature of the electron. In the same way we are forced to assume both wavelike and particle like properties for all matter: electrons, protons, neutrons, molecules etc. and also light, X-rays, $\\gamma$-rays etc. have to be included in this. In other words, matter and radiation have a dual 'waveparticle' nature and this new concept is known as wave particle duality. Niels Bohr pointed out in stating his principle of complementarity that both wave and particle aspects are required for the complete description of both radiation and matter. Both aspects are always present and either may be revealed by an experiment. However, both aspects cannot be revealed simultaneously in a single experiment, which aspect is revealed is determined by the nature of the experiment being done. If you put a diffraction grating in the path of a light beam, you reveal it as a wave. If you allow the light beam to hit a metal surface, you need to regard the beam as a stream of particles to explain your observations. There is no simple experiment that you can carry out with the\n\nbeam that will require you to interpret it as a wave and as a particle at the same time. Light behaves as a stream of photons when it interacts with matter and behaves as a wave in traveling from a source to the place where it is detected. In effect, all micro-particles (electrons, protons, photons, atoms etc.) propagate as if they were waves and exchange energies as if they were particles - that is the wave particle duality.\nExample 19.8: A particle of mass 5.0 mg moves with speed of $8.0 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$.

In an electron microscope, electric and magnetic fields rather than optical lenses are used to focus electrons by means of electromagnetic forces that are exerted on moving charges. The resulting deflections of the electrons beams are similar to the refraction effects produced by glass lenses used to focus light in optical microscope. The electrons are accelerated to high energies by applying voltage from 30 kV to several megavolts. Such high voltages give extremely short wavelength and also give the electron sufficient energy to penetrate specimen of reasonable thickness. A resolution of 0.5 to 1 nm is possible with a 50 kV microscope as compared to best optical resolution of $0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. A schematic diagram of the electron microscope is shown in the Figure 19.13. The magnetic conducting lens concentrates the beam from an electron gun on to the specimen. Electrons are scattered out of the beam from the thicker parts of the specimen. The transmitted beam therefore has spatial differences in density that correspond to the features of the specimen. The objective and intermediate lenses produce a real intermediate image and projection lens forms the final image which can be viewed on a fluorescent screen or photographed on special film known as electron micrograph. A three dimensional image of remarkable quality can be achieved by modern versions called scanning electron microscopes.\n\n### 19.8 UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE\n\nPosition and momentum of a particle cannot both be measured simultaneously with perfect accuracy. There is always a fundamental uncertainty associated with any measurement. This uncertainty is not associated with the measuring instrument. It is a consequence of the wave particle duality of matter and radiation. This was first proposed by Werner Heisenberg in 1927 and hence is known as Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This fundamental uncertainty is completely negligible for measurements of position and momentum of macroscopic objects but is a predominant fact of life in the atomic domain. For example, a stream of light photons scattering from a flying tennis ball\n\nhardly affects its path, but one photon striking an electron drastically alters the electron's motion. Since light has also wave properties, we would expect to be able to determine the position of the electron only to within one wavelength of the light being used. Hence, in order to observe the position of an electron with less uncertainty and also for minimizing diffraction effect, we must use light of short wavelength. But it will alter the motion drastically making momentum measurement less precise. If light of wavelength $\\lambda$ is used to locate a micro particle moving along $x$-axis, the uncertainty in its position measurement is\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\approx \\lambda\n$$\n\nAt most, the photon of light can transfer all its momentum $\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{h}}{\\lambda}\\right)$ to the micro particle whose own momentum will then be uncertain by an amount\n\n$$\n\\Delta p \\approx \\frac{\\mathrm{~h}}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nMultiplying these two uncertainties gives\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\approx \\lambda\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{~h}}{\\lambda}\\right) \\approx \\mathrm{h}\n$$\n\nThe equation 19.19 is the mathematical form of uncertainty principle. It states that the product of the uncertainty $\\Delta x$ in the position of a particle at some instant and the uncertainty $\\Delta p$ in the $x$-component of its momentum at the same instant approximately equals Planck's constant $h$.\nThere is another form of uncertainty principle which relates the energy of a particle and the time at which it had the energy. If the $\\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in our knowledge of the energy of our particle and if the time interval during which\nthe particle had the energy $E \\pm \\frac{\\Delta E}{2}$ is $t_{0} \\pm \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$, then\n\n$$\n\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\approx h\n$$\n\nThus more accurately we determined the energy of a particle, the more uncertain we will be of the time during which it has that energy.\nAccording to Heisenberg's more careful calculations, he found that at the very best\n\nFor Your Information\nYou can never accurately describe all aspects of a subatomic particle at once.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\geq \\hbar \\\\\n& \\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\geq \\hbar\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\hbar=\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\pi}=1.05 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js}\n$$\n\nWener Karl Heisenberg received Nobel Prize for physics in 1932 for the development of quantum mechanics.\n\nExample 19.10: The life time of an electron in an excited state is about $10^{-8} \\mathrm{~s}$. What is its uncertainty in energy during this time?\n\n# Solution:\n\nUsing uncertainty principle\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\approx \\hbar \\\\\n& \\Delta E=\\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{1.05 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js}}{10^{-8} \\mathrm{~s}} \\\\\n& \\Delta E=1.05 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 19.11: An electron is to be confined to a box of the size of the nucleus $\\left(1.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$. What would the speed of the electron be if it were so confined?\n\n## Solution:\n\nMaximum uncertainty in the location of electron equals the size of the box itself that is $\\Delta x=1.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\mathrm{~m}$. The minimum uncertainty in the velocity of electron is found from Heisenberg uncertainty principle\n\n$$\n\\Delta p \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nm \\Delta V \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n\n$\\Delta V \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\mathrm{~m} \\Delta \\mathrm{x}}=\\frac{1.05 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js}}{9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\mathrm{~m}}=1.15 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$\nFor confinement In the box, the speed should be greater than the speed of light. Because this is not possible, we must conclude that an electron can never be found inside the nucleus.\n\n# SUMMARY\n\n- An inertial frame of reference is defined as a coordinate system in which the law of inertia is valid.

It is called annihilation of matter.\n- Position and momentum of a particle cannot both be measured simultaneously with perfect accuracy. There is always a fundamental uncertainty associated with any measurement. It is a consequence of the wave particle duality of matter and radiation. It is known as Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\n## QUESTIONS\n\n19.1 What are the measurements on which two observers in relative motion will always agree upon?\n19.2 Does the dilation means that time really passes more slowly in moving system or that it only seems to pass more slowly?\n19.3 If you are moving in a spaceship at a very high speed relative to the Earth, would you notice a difference (a) in your pulse rate (b) in the pulse rate of people on Earth?\n\n19.4 If the speed of light were infinite, what would the equations of special theory of relativity reduce to?\n19.5 Since mass is a form of energy, can we conclude that a compressed spring has more mass than the same spring when it is not compressed?\n19.6 As a solid is heated and begins to glow, why does it first appear red?\n19.7 What happens to total radiation from a blackbody if its absolute temperature is doubled?\n19.8 A beam of red light and a beam of blue light have exactly the same energy.

Describe the application of laser including holography.\n\nThe branch of physics that deals with the investigation of wavelengths and intensities of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by atoms is called spectroscopy. It includes the study of spectra produced by atoms. In general there are three types of spectra called (i) continuous spectra, (ii) band spectra, and (iii) discrete or line spectra.\nBlack body radiation spectrum, as described in chapter 19 is an example of continuous spectra; molecular spectra are the examples of band spectra while the atomic spectra, which we shall investigate in detail in this chapter, are examples of discrete or line spectra.\n\n### 20.1 ATOMIC SPECTRA\n\nWhen an atomic gas or vapour at much less than atmospheric pressure is suitably excited, usually by passing an electric current through it, the emitted radiation has a spectrum, which contains certain specific wavelengths only. An idealized arrangement for observing such atomic spectra is shown in Fig. 20.1. Actual spectrometer uses diffraction grating for better results.\nThe impression on the screen is in the form of lines if the slit in front of the source $S$ is narrow rectangle. It is for this reason that the spectrum is referred to as line spectrum.\nThe fact that the spectrum of any element contains wavelengths that exhibit definite regularities was utilized in the second half of the $19^{\\circ}$ century in identifying different elements.\n\nFig. 20.1 Line spectrum of hydrogen\nThese regularities were classified into certain groups called the spectral series. The first such series was identified by J.J Balmer in 1885 in the spectrum of hydrogen. This series, called the Balmer series, is shown in Fig.20.2, and is in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe results obtained by Balmer were expressed in 1896 by J.R Rydberg in the following mathematical form\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}=R_{H}\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{2}}-\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{H}$ is the Rydberg's constant. Its value is $1.0974 \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}$. Since then many more series have been discovered and proved helpful in predicting the arrangement of the electrons in different atoms.\n\n# Atomic Spectrum of Hydrogen\n\nThe Balmer series contain wavelengths in the visible portion of the hydrogen spectrum. The spectral lines of hydrogen in the ultraviolet and infrared regions fall into several other series. In the ultraviolet region, the Lyman series contains the wavelengths given by the formula\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}=R_{H}\\left(\\frac{1}{1^{2}}-\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nn=2,3,4, \\ldots \\ldots\n$$\n\nIn the infrared region, three spectral series have been found whose lines have the wavelengths specified by the formulae:\nFig. 20.2\n\n## Different types of spectra\n(a) Continuous spectrum\n(b) Line spectrum\n(c) Band spectrum\n\nLine spectrum of atomic hydrogen. Only the Balmer series lies in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nPaschen series\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}=R_{H}\\left(\\frac{1}{3^{2}}-\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\quad n=4,5,6, \\ldots \\ldots$\nBrackett series\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}=R_{H}\\left(\\frac{1}{4^{2}}-\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\quad n=5,6,7, \\ldots \\ldots$\nPfund series\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}=R_{H}\\left(\\frac{1}{5^{2}}-\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\quad n=6,7,8, \\ldots \\ldots$\nThe existence of these regularities in the hydrogen spectrum together with similar regularities in the spectra of more complex elements, proposes a definite test for any theory of atomic structure.\n\n# 20.2 BOHR'S MODEL OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM\n\nIn order to explain the empirical results obtained by Rydberg, Neils Bohr, in 1913, formulated a model of hydrogen atom utilizing classical physics and Planck's quantum theory. This semi classical theory is based on the following three postulates:\n\nPostulate I: An electron, bound to the nucleus in an atom, can move around the nucleus in certain circular orbits without radiating. These orbits are called the discrete stationary states of the atom.\n\nPostulate II: Only those stationary orbits are allowed for which orbital angular momentum is equal to an integral multiple of $\\frac{\\mathrm{h}}{2 \\pi}$ i.e.,\n\n$$\nm v r=\\frac{\\mathrm{nh}}{2 \\pi}\n$$\n\nwhere $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$ and $n$ is called the principal quantum number, $m$ and $v$ are the mass and velocity of the orbiting electron respectively, and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\nPostulate III: Whenever an electron makes a transition, that is, jumps from high energy state $E_{n}$ to a lower energy state $E_{p}$, a photon of energy $h$ fis emitted so that\n\n$$\nh f=E_{n}-E_{p}\n$$\n\nwhere $f=c / \\lambda$ is the frequency of the radiation emitted.\n\n# de-Broglie's Interpretation of Bohr's Orbits\n\nAt the time of formulation of Bohr's theory, there was no justification for the first two postulates, while Postulate III had some roots in Planck's thesis. Later on with the development of de Broglie's hypothesis, some justification could be seen in Postulate II as explained below:\n(b)\n(c)\nStanding de Broglie waves of electrons around the circumference of Bohr orbits.\nConsider a string of length $\\ell$ as shown in Fig. 20.3 (a). If this is put into stationary vibrations, we must have $\\ell=n \\lambda$ where $n$ is an integer. Suppose that the string is bent into circle of radius $r$, as demonstrated for $n=3$ and $n=6$ in Fig. 20.3 (b) and (c), so that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ell & =2 \\pi r=n \\lambda \\\\\n\\text { or } \\quad \\lambda & =\\frac{2 \\pi r}{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom de Broglie's hypothesis\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{p}=\\frac{h}{m v}\n$$\n\nthus\n\n$$\n\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{2 \\pi r}{n}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nm v r=\\frac{n h}{2 \\pi}\n$$\n\nwhich is Postulate II.\n\n## Helium was identified in the Sun using spectroscopy before it was discovered on earth.\n(a)\n\nFig. 20.3 Stationary wave for $n=3$ on a string.\n\nFig. 20.4\n\n## For You Information\n\nThe first Bohr orbit in the hydrogen atom has a radius $r_{1}=5.3 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~m}$. The second and third Bohr orbits have radii $r_{2}=4 r_{1}$ and $r_{3}=9 r_{1}$ respectively.\n\n## Quantized Radii\n\nConsider a hydrogen atom in which electron moving with velocity $v_{n}$ is in stationary circular orbit of radius $r_{n}$. From Eq. (20.6),\n\n$$\nv_{n}=\\frac{n h}{2 \\pi m r_{n}}\n$$\n\nFor this electron to stay in the circular orbit, shown in Fig. 20.4, the centripetal force $F_{c}=\\frac{m v_{n}^{2}}{r_{n}}$ is provided by the Coulomb's force $F_{x}=\\frac{k e^{2}}{r_{n}^{2}}$, where $e$ is the magnitude of charge on electron as well as on the hydrogen nucleus consisting of a single proton. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\frac{m v_{n}^{2}}{r_{n}}=\\frac{k e^{2}}{r_{n}^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere constant $k$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}}$.\nAfter substituting for $v_{n}$ from Eq. 20.9, we have\n\n$$\nr_{n}=\\frac{n^{2} h^{2}}{4 \\pi^{2} k m e^{2}}=n^{2} r_{1}\n$$\n\nwhere $r_{1}=\\frac{h^{2}}{4 \\pi^{2} k m e^{2}}=0.053 \\mathrm{~nm}$\nThis agrees with the experimentally measured values and is called the first Bohr orbit radius of the hydrogen atom. Thus according to Bohr's theory, the radii of different stationary orbits of the electrons in the hydrogen atom are given by\n\n$$\nr_{n}=r_{1}, 4 r_{1}, 9 r_{1}, 16 r_{1}, \\ldots \\ldots\n$$\n\nSubstituting the value of $r_{n}$ from Eq. 20.11 in Eq. 20.9, the speed of electron in the nth orbit is\n\n$$\nv_{n}=\\frac{2 \\pi k e^{2}}{n h}\n$$\n\n## Quantized Energies\n\nLet us now calculate the total energy $E_{n}$ of the electron in the Bohr orbit; $E_{n}$ is the sum of the kinetic energy K.E. and the potential energy U.i.e.,\n\n$$\nE_{n}=K \\cdot E_{1}+U=\\frac{1}{2} m v_{n}^{2}+\\left(\\frac{-k e^{2}}{r_{n}}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy rearranging Eq. (20.10), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_{n}^{2}=\\frac{k e^{2}}{2 r_{n}} \\\\\nE_{n}=\\frac{k e^{2}}{2 r_{n}} \\frac{k e^{2}}{r_{n}}=\\frac{k e^{2}}{2 r_{n}}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nBy substituting the value of $r_{n}$ from Eq. (20.11), we have\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi^{2} k^{2} m e^{4}}{h^{2}}\\right)=\\frac{E_{n}}{n^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nE_{n}=\\frac{2 \\pi^{2} k^{2} m e^{4}}{h^{2}}=\\text { constant }=13.6 \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n\nwhich is the energy required to completely remove an electron from the first Bohr orbit. This is called ionization energy. The ionization energy may be provided to the electron by collision with an external electron. The minimum potential through which this external electron should be accelerated so that it can supply the requisite ionization energy is known as ionization potential. Thus for $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$ we get the allowed energy levels of a hydrogen atom to be\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-E_{0},-\\frac{E_{0}}{4},-\\frac{E_{0}}{9},-\\frac{E_{0}}{16}, \\ldots \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe experimentally measured value of the binding energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom is in perfect agreement with the value predicted by Bohr theory.\nNormally the electron in the hydrogen atom is in the lowest energy state corresponding to $n=1$ and this state is called the ground state or normal state. When it is in higher orbit, it is said to be in the excited state. The atom may be exited by collision with externally accelerated electron. The potential through which an electron should be accelerated so that, on collision it can lift the electron in the atom from its ground state to some higher state, is known as excitation potential.\n\n# Hydrogen Emission Spectrum\n\nThe results derived above for the energy levels along with Postulate III can be used to arrive at the expression for the wavelength of the hydrogen spectrum. Suppose that the electron in the hydrogen atom is in the excited state $n$ with\n\n## Photon must have energy exactly equal to the energy difference between the two shells for excitation of an atom but an electron with $K . E$ greater that the required difference can excite the gas atoms.\nFig. 20.5 Energy level diagram for the hydrogen atom.\nenergy $E_{n}$ and makes a transition to a lower state $p$ with energy $E_{p}$, where $E_{p}<E_{n}$, then\nwhere\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{E_{0}}{n^{2}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad E_{p}=-\\frac{E_{0}}{p^{2}}\n$$\n\nhence\n\n$$\nh f=-E_{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{n^{2}}-\\frac{1}{p^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSubstituting for $f=c / \\lambda$ and rearranging\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}=\\frac{E_{0}}{h c}\\left(\\frac{1}{p^{2}}-\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}=R_{H}\\left(\\frac{1}{p^{2}}-\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{H}$ is the Rydberg constant given by the equation\n\n$$\nR_{H}=\\frac{E_{0}}{h c}=1.0974 \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}\n$$\n\nwhich agrees well with the latest measured value for hydrogen atom.\nEq. 20.17 reduces to the empirical result derived by Rydberg and given by Eq 20.1, provided that we substitute $p=2$ and $n=3,4,5, \\ldots \\ldots$ The different energy levels corresponding to Eq. 20.17 are shown in Fig. 20.5.\n\nExample 20.1: Find the speed of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n## Solution:\n\nThe speed found from Eq. (20.12) with $n=1$, is\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nv_{1}=\\frac{2 \\pi \\mathrm{ke}^{2}}{\\mathrm{~h}}=2 \\times 3.14 \\times\\left(9 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{Nm}^{3} \\mathrm{C}^{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\left(1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}\\right)^{2}}{6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js}}\\right) \\\\\nv_{1}=2.19 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n### 20.3 INNER SHELL TRANSITIONS AND CHARACTERISTIC X-RAYS\n\nThe transitions of electrons in the hydrogen or other light elements result in the emission of spectral lines in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet region of electromagnetic spectrum due to small energy differences in the transition levels.\n\nIn heavy atoms, the electrons are assumed to be arranged in concentric shells labeled as $\\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{M}, \\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{O}$ etc., the K shell being closest to the nucleus, the $L$ shell next, and so on (Fig. 20.6). The inner shell electrons are tightly bound and large amount of energy is required for their displacement from their normal energy levels. After excitation, when an atom returns to its normal state, photons of larger energy are emitted. Thus transition of inner shell electrons in heavy atoms gives rise to the emission of high energy photons or Xrays. These X-rays consist of series of specific wavelengths or frequencies and hence are called characteristic X-rays. The study of characteristic $X$-rays spectra has played a very important role in the study of atomic structure and the periodic table of elements.\n\n# Production of X-rays\n\nFig. 20.7 shows an arrangement of producing X-rays. It consists of a high vacuum tube called X-ray tube. When the cathode is heated by the filament $F$, it emits electrons which are accelerated towards the anode T. If $V$ is the\npotential difference between $C$ and $T$, the kinetic energy $K, E$. with which the electron strike the target is given by\n\n$$\n\\text { K.E. }=\\text { Ve }\n$$\n\nSuppose that these fast moving electrons of energy Ve strike a target made of tungsten or any other heavy element. It is possible that in collision, the electrons in the innermost shells, such as K or L , will be knocked out. Suppose that one of the electrons in the K shell is removed, thereby producing a vacancy or hole in that shell. The electron from the $L$ shell\n\nFig. 20.8\njumps to occupy the hole in the K shell, thereby emitting a photon of energy h $f_{h c}$ called the $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{X}$-ray given by\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{h} f_{\\mathrm{kn}}=E_{\\mathrm{k}}-E_{\\mathrm{K}}\n$$\n\nIt is also possible that the electron from the $M$ shell might also jump to occupy the hole in the K shell. The photons emitted are $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{X}$-ray with energies\n\n$$\nh f_{k 2}=E_{k}-E_{k}\n$$\n\nthese photons give rise to $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{X}$-ray and so on.\nThe photons emitted in such transitions i.e., inner shell transitions are called characteristic X-rays, because their energies depend upon the type of target material.\nThe holes created in the $L$ and $M$ shells are occupied by transitions of electrons from higher states creating more X-rays. The characteristic X-rays appear as discrete lines on a continuous spectrum as shown in Fig. 20.8.\n\n# The Continuous X-ray Spectrum\n\nThe continuous spectrum is due to an effect known as bremsstrahlung or braking radiation. When the fast moving electrons bombard the target, they are suddenly slowed down on impact with the target. We know that an accelerating charge emits electromagnetic radiation. Hence, these impacting electrons emit radiation as they are strongly decelerated by the target. Since the rate of deceleration is so large, the emitted radiation correspond to short wavelength and so the bremsstrahlung is in the X-ray region. In the case when the electrons lose all their kinetic energy in the first collision, the entire kinetic energy appears as a X-ray photon of energy $\\mathrm{h} f_{\\text {max }}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{K} . \\mathrm{E}=h f_{\\text {max }}\n$$\n\nThe wavelength $\\lambda_{\\text {min }}$ in Fig. 20.8 corresponds to frequency $f_{\\text {max }}$. Other electrons do not lose all their energy in the first collision. They may suffer a number of collisions before coming to rest. This will give rise to photons of smaller energy or X-rays of longer wavelength. Thus the continuous spectrum is obtained due to deceleration of impacting electrons.\n\n## Properties and Uses of X-rays\n\nX-rays have many practical applications in medicine and industry. Because X-rays can penetrate several centimetres\n\ninto a solid matter, so they can be used to visualize the interiors of the materials opaque to ordinary light, such as fractured bones or defects in structural steel. The object to be visualized is placed between an X-ray source and a large sheet of photographic film; the darkening of the film is proportional to the radiation exposure. A crack or air bubble allows greater amount of X-rays to pass. This appears as a dark area on the photographic film. Shadow of bones appears lighter than the surrounding flesh. It is due to the fact that bones contain greater proportions of elements with high atomic number and so they absorb greater amount of incident X-rays than flesh. In flesh, light elements like carbon, hydrogen and oxygen predominate. These elements allow greater amount of incident X-rays to pass through them.\n\n## CAT-Scanner\n\nIn the recent past, several vastly improved X-ray techniques have been developed. One widely used system is computerized axial tomography; the corresponding instrument is called CAT-Scanner. The X-ray source produces a thin fan-shaped beam that is detected on the opposite side of the subject by an array of several hundred detectors in a line. Each detector measures absorption of X-ray along a thin line through the subject. The entire apparatus is rotated around the subject in the plane of the beam during a few seconds. The changing reactions of the detector are recorded digitally; a computer processes this information and reconstructs a picture of different densities over an entire cross section of the subject. Density differences of the order of one percent can be detected with CAT-Scans. Tumors, and other anomalies much too small to be seen with older techniques can be detected.\n\n## Biological Effects of X-rays\n\nX-rays cause damage to living tissue. As X-ray photons are absorbed in tissues, they break molecular bonds and create highly reactive free radicals (such as H and OH ), which in turn can disturb the molecular structure of the proteins and especially the genetic material. Young and rapidly growing cells are particularly susceptible; hence X-rays are useful for selective destruction of cancer cells. On the other hand a cell may be damaged by radiation but survive, continue dividing and produce generation of defective cells. Thus X-rays can cause cancer. Even when the organism itself shows no apparent damage, excessive\n\nFor Your Information\nAn X-ray picture of a hand.\n\nInteresting Information\nIn CAT scanning a \"fanned-out\" array of X-ray beams is directed through the patient from a number of different orientations.\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(a) This two-dimensional CAT scan of a brain reveals a large intracranial tumor (colored purple). (b) Threedimensional CAT scans are now available and this example reveals an arachnoid cyst (colored yellow) within a skull. In both photographs the colors are artificial having been computer generated to aid in distinguishing anatomical features.\nradiation exposure can cause changes in their reproductive system that will affect the organism's offspring.\n\n### 20.4 UNCERTAINTY WITHIN THE ATOM\n\nOne of the characteristics of dual nature of matter is a fundamental limitation in the accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle.\nHeisenberg showed that this is given by the equation\n\n$$\n\\Delta p \\Delta x \\geq \\frac{h}{2 \\pi}\n$$\n\nHowever, these limitations are significant in the realm of atom. One interesting question is whether electrons are present in atomic nuclei. As the typical nuclei are loss than $10^{-14} \\mathrm{~m}$ in diameter, for an electron to be confined within such a nucleus, the uncertainty in its position is of the order of $10^{-14} \\mathrm{~m}$. The corresponding uncertainty in the electron's momentum is\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\Delta p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta x} \\\\\n\\geq \\frac{6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js}}{10^{-14} \\mathrm{~m}}=6.63 \\times 10^{-20} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\\\\n\\Delta v=\\frac{6.63 \\times 10^{-20} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{9.11 \\times 10^{-21} \\mathrm{~kg}} \\geq 7.3 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nHence, for the electron to be confined to a nucleus, its speed would have to be greater than $10^{10} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ i.e., greater than the speed of light. Because this is impossible, we must conclude that an electron can never be found inside of a nucleus. But can an electron reside inside the atom? To find this, we again calculate the speed of an electron and if it turns to be less than the speed of light, we have reasonable expectation of finding the electron within the atom but outside the nucleus. The radius of the hydrogen atom is about $5 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~m}$. Applying the uncertainty principle to the momentum of electron in the atom we have\n\nAs\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta x} \\\\\n& \\Delta p=m \\Delta v \\\\\n& \\Delta v=\\frac{h}{m \\Delta x}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\nFor an atom $\\Delta x$ is given as $5 \\times 10^{-1} \\mathrm{~m}$\nThus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta v & =\\frac{6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js}}{9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 5 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~m}} \\\\\n& =1.46 \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis speed of the electron is less than the speed of light, therefore, it can exist in the atom but outside the nucleus.\n\n# 20.5 LASER\n\nLaser is the acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. As the name indicates, lasers are used for producing an intense, monochromatic, and unidirectional coherent beam of visible light. To understand the working of a laser, terms such as stimulated emission and population inversion must be understood.\n\n## Spontaneous and Stimulated Emissions\n\nConsider a sample of free atoms some of which are in the ground state with energy $E_{1}$ and some in the excited state $E_{2}$ as shown in Fig. 20.9. The photons of energy h $f=E_{2}-E_{1}$ are incident on this sample. These incident photons can interact with atoms in two different ways. In Fig. 20.9 (a) the incident photon is absorbed by an atom in the ground state $E_{1}$, thereby leaving the atom in the excited state $E_{2}$. This process is called stimulated or induced absorption. Once in the excited state, two things can happen to the atom. (i) It may decay by spontaneous emission as shown in Fig. 20.9 (b), in which the atom emits a photon of energy h $f=E_{2}-E_{1}$ in any arbitrary direction.\n\nThe other alternative for the atom in the excited state $E_{2}$ is to decay by stimulated or induced emission as shown in Fig. 20.9 (c). In this case the incident photon of energy h $f=E_{2}-E_{1}$ induces the atom to decay by emitting a photon that travels in the direction of the incident photon. For each incident photon we will have two photons going in the same direction thus we have accomplished two things; an amplified as well as a unidirectional coherent beam. From a practical point this is possible only if there is more stimulated or induced emission than spontaneous emission. This can be achieved as described in the next section.\nFig 20.9\n\n# Population Inversioq and Lasey Action\n\nLet us consider a simple case of a material whose atoms can reside in three different states as shown in Fig. 20.10, state\nFig. 20.10\n$E$, which is ground state; the excited state $E_{1}$, in which the\natoms can reside only for $10^{-5} \\mathrm{~s}$ and the metastable state $E_{1}$, in which the atoms can reside for $\\sim 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~s}$, much longer than $10 \\mathrm{~s}$. A metastable state is an excited state in which an excited electron is unusually stable and from which the electron spontaneously falls to lower state only after relatively longer time. The transition from or to this state are difficult as compared to other excited states. Hence, instead of direct excitation to this state, the electrons are excited to higher level for spontaneous fall to metastable state. Also let us assume that the incident photons of energy h $f=E_{1}-E$, raise the atom from the ground state $E$, to the excited state $E_{2}$, but the excited atoms do not decay back to $E_{1}$. Thus the only alternative for the atoms in the excited state $E_{1}$ is to decay spontaneously to state $E_{2}$, the atoms reach state $E_{2}$ much faster than they leave state $E_{2}$. This eventually leads to the situation that the state $E_{2}$ contains more atoms than state $E_{1}$. This situation is known as population inversion.\n\nOnce the population inversion has been reached, the lasing action of a laser is simple to achieve. The atoms in the metastable state $E_{2}$ are bombarded by photons of energy $\\mathrm{h} f=E_{2}-E_{1}$, resulting in an induced emission, giving an intense, coherent beam in the direction of the incident photon.\n\nThe emitted photons must be confined in the assembly long enough to stimulate further emission from other excited atoms. This is achieved by using mirrors at the two ends of the assembly. One end is made totally reflecting, and the other end is partially transparent to allow the laser beam to escape (Fig.20.11). As the photons move back and forth between the reflecting mirrors they continue to stimulate other excited atoms to emit photons. As the process continues the number of photons multiply, and the resulting radiation is, therefore, much more intense and coherent than light from ordinary sources.\nFig. 20.11\n\n# Helium-Neon Laser\n\nIt is a most common type of lasers used in physics laboratories. Its discharge tube is filled with $85 \\%$ helium and $15 \\%$ neon gas. The neon is the lasing or active medium in this tube. By chance, helium and neon have nearly identical metastable states, respectively located 20.61 eV and 20.66 eV level. The high voltage electric discharge excites the electrons in some of the helium atoms to the 20.61 eV state. In this laser, population inversion in neon is achieved by direct collisions with same energy electrons of helium atoms. Thus excited helium atoms collide with neon atoms, each transferring its own 20.61 eV of energy to an electron in the neon atom along with 0.05 eV of K.E. from the moving atom. As a result, the electrons in neon atoms are raised to the 20.66 eV state. In this way, a population inversion is sustained in the neon gas relative to an energy level of 18.70 eV . Spontaneous emission from neon atoms initiate laser action and stimulated emission causes electrons in the neon to drop from 20.66 eV to the 18.70 eV level and red laser light of wavelength 632.8 nm corresponding to 1.96 eV energy is generated (Fig. 20.12).\n\n## Uses of Laser in Medicine and Industry\n\n1. Laser beams are used as surgical tool for \"welding\" detached retinas.\n2. The narrow intense beam of laser can be used to destroy tissue in a localized area. Tiny organelles with a living cell have been destroyed by using laser to study how the absence of that organelle affects the behavior of the cell.\n3. Finely focused beam of laser has been used to destroy cancerous and pre-cancerous cell.\n\nThe helium-neon laser beam is being used to diagnose diseases of the eye. The use of laser technology in the field of ophthalmology is widespread.\n\n4. The heat of the laser seals off capillaries and lymph vessels to prevent spread of the disease.\n5. The intense heat produced in small area by a laser beam is also used for welding and machining metals and for drilling tiny holes in hard materials.\n6. The precise straightness of a laser beam is also useful to surveyors for lining up equipment especially in inaccessible locations.\n7. It is potential energy source for inducing fusion reactions.\n8. It can be used for telecommunication along optical fibres.\n9. Laser beam can be used to generate threedimensional images of objects in a process called holography.\n\n## SUMMARY\n\n- When an atomic gas or vapours at less than atmospheric pressure is suitably excited, usually by passing electric current through it, the emitted radiation has a spectrum which contains certain specific wavelengths only.\n- Postulates of Bohr's model of hydrogen atom are:\ni. An electron, bound to the nucleus in an atom, can move around the nucleus in certain circular orbits without radiating. These orbits are called the discrete stationary states of the atom.\nii. Only those stationary states are allowed for which orbital angular momentum is equal to an integral multiple of h i.e., $m \\nu r=\\frac{\\pi h}{2 \\pi}$\niii. Whenever an electron makes a transition, i.e., jumps from high energy state $E_{n}$ to a lower energy state $E_{s}$, a photon of energy $h$ is emitted so that $h f=E_{n}-E_{s}$.\n- The transition of electrons in the hydrogen or other light elements result in the emission of spectral lines in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet region of electromagnetic spectrum due to small energy differences in the transition levels.\n- The X-rays emitted in inner shell transitions are called characteristic X-rays, because their energy depends upon the type of target material.\n- The X-rays that are emitted in all directions and with a continuous range of frequencies are known as continuous X-rays.\n- Laser is the acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.\n\nThe incident photon absorbed by an atom in the ground state $E_{1}$, thereby leaving the atom in the excited state $E_{2}$ is called stimulated or induced absorption.\nSpontaneous or induced emission is that in which the atom emits a photon of energy $\\mathrm{h} f=E_{2}-E_{1}$ in any arbitrary direction.\nStimulated or induced emission is that in which the incident photon of energy h $f=E_{2}-E_{1}$ induces the atom to decay by emitting a photon that travels in the direction of the incident photon. For each incident photon, we will have two photons going in the same direction giving rise to an amplified as well as a unidirectional coherent beam.\n\n# QUESTIONS\n\n20.1 Bohr's theory of hydrogen atom is based upon several assumptions.

From his experiments Ernest Rutherford developed a nuclear model of the atom. His model of the atom consisted of a small dense, positively charged nucleus with negative electrons orbiting about it. In 1920 Rutherford suggested that there is probably another particle within the nucleus, neutral one, to which he gave the name neutron. James Chadwick discovered neutron in 1932.\n\n### 21.1 ATOMIC NUCLEUS\n\nAt the centre of each and every atom there is an infinitesimally small nucleus. The entire positive charge of the atom and about 99.9 percent of its mass is concentrated in the nucleus. The tininess of the nucleus can be imagined by comparing that the radius of the atom is $10^{5}$ times the radius of the nucleus.\n\nA nucleus consists of nucleons comprising of protons and neutrons. A proton has a positive charge equal to $1.6 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{C}$ and its mass is $1.673 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg}$. A neutron has no charge on it, but its mass is $1.675 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg}$. The mass of a neutron is almost equal to mass of proton. To indicate the mass of atomic particles, instead of kilogram, unified mass scale (u) is generally used. By definition 1 u is exactly one twelveth the mass of carbon ${ }^{12}$ atom ( $1 \\mathrm{u}=1.6606 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg}$ ). In this unit the mass of a proton is 1.007276 u and that of a neutron is 1.008665 u while that of an electron is 0.00055 u .\n\nThe charge on a proton is equal in magnitude to the charge on an electron. The charge on the proton is positive while that of an electron is negative. As an atom on the whole is electrically neutral, therefore, we can conclude that the number of protons inside the nucleus is equal to the number of electrons outside the nucleus. The number of protons inside a nucleus is called the atomic number or the charge number of an atom. It is denoted by $Z$. Thus the total charge of any nucleus is $Z e$, here $e$ indicates charge on one proton.\n\nThe combined number of all the protons and neutrons in a nucleus is known as its mass number and is denoted by $A$.\n\nThe number of neutrons $N$ present in a nucleus is given by\n\n$$\nN=(A-Z)\n$$\n\nWe now consider different elements of the periodic table. Hydrogen atom is simplest of all the atoms. Its nucleus is composed of only one proton; that is for hydrogen $A=1$, $Z=1$. That is why hydrogen is represented by the symbol ${ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}$. Next in the periodic table after the hydrogen element is the helium element. Its nucleus contains two protons and two neutrons. This means for helium $A=4$ and $Z=2$; and hence helium is represented as ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$. We now take the example of uranium - a heavy element of the periodic table. The charge number $Z$ of uranium is 92 while its mass number $A$ is 235 . This is represented as ${ }_{82}^{235} \\mathrm{U}$. It has 92 protons while the number of neutrons $N$ is given by the equation $N=A-Z=235-92=143$. In this way the number of protons and neutrons in atoms of all the elements of the periodic table can be determined. It has been observed that the number of neutrons and protons in the initial light elements of the periodic table is almost equal but in the later heavy elements the number of neutrons is greater than the number of protons in the nucleus.\n\n# 21.2 ISOTOPES\n\nIsotopes are such nuclei of an element that have the same charge number $Z$, but have different mass number $A$, that is in the nucleus of such an element the number of protons is the same, but the number of neutrons is different. Helium, for example has two isotopes. These are symbolically represented as ${ }_{2}^{3} \\mathrm{He}$ and ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$. As the charge number of helium is 2 , therefore, there are two protons in the helium nucleus. The neutron number of the first isotope is, according to Eq. 21.1 is $3-2=1$ and that in the second isotope ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$, the number of neutron is $4-2=2$. Hydrogen has three isotopes represented by ${ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H},{ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H},{ }_{2}^{3} \\mathrm{H}$. Its first isotope is called ordinary hydrogen or protium. There is only one proton in its nucleus. The second isotope of hydrogen is called deuterium. It has one proton and one neutron in its nucleus. Its nucleus is called deuteron. The third isotope of hydrogen has two neutrons and one proton in its nucleus and it is called tritium. The isotopes of hydrogen are shown in Figs. 21.1 (a,b,c).\nThe chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element are alike, as the chemical properties of an element depend only upon the number of electrons around the nucleus, that is upon the charge number $Z$, which for all the isotopes of an element is the same. It is, therefore, not possible to separate the isotopes of an element by chemical methods. Physical methods are found to be successful for this purpose. A\n(a) (Protium)\n(b) (Deuterium)\nFig. 21.1\n\n## Both Xenon and caesium each have 36 isotopes.\n\n| For Your Information |  |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| Some atomic masses |  |\n| Particle | Mass (u) |\n| e | 0.00055 |\n| n | 1.008665 |\n| ${ }^{3} \\mathrm{H}$ | 1.007276 |\n| ${ }^{3} \\mathrm{H}$ | 2.014102 |\n| ${ }^{3} \\mathrm{H}$ | 3.01605 |\n| ${ }^{3} \\mathrm{He}$ | 3.01603 |\n| ${ }^{3} \\mathrm{He}$ | 4.002603 |\n| ${ }^{7} \\mathrm{Li}$ | 7.016004 |\n| ${ }^{10} \\mathrm{Be}$ | 10.013534 |\n| ${ }^{15} \\mathrm{~N}$ | 14.0031 |\n| ${ }^{17} \\mathrm{O}$ | 16.9991 |\n\ndevice with the help of which not only the isotopes of any element can be separated from one another but their masses can also be determined quite accurately is called mass spectrograph.\n\n## Mass Spectrograph\n\nA simple mass spectrograph is shown in Fig. 21.2 (a). The atoms or molecules of the element under investigation, in vapour form, are ionized in the ions source S. As a result of ionization, one electron is removed from the particle, leaving with a net positive charge $+e$. The positive ions, escaping the slit $S_{1}$, are accelerated through a potential difference $V$ applied between the two slits $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$.\nFig. 21.2\nThe ions pass through the slit $S_{2}$ in the form of a narrow beam. The K.E. of singly charged ion at the slit $S_{2}$ will be given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=V e\n$$\n\nThe ions are then subjected to a perpendicular and uniform magnetic field $B$ in a vacuum chamber, where they are deflected in semicircular paths towards a detector. The detector records the number of ions arriving per second. The centripetal force applied by the magnetic field is given by\n\n$$\nB e v=\\frac{m v^{2}}{r}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nm=\\frac{B e r}{v}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values of $v$ from Eq. 21.2, we get\n\n$$\nm=\\left(\\frac{e r^{2}}{2 V}\\right) B^{2}\n$$\n\nThe above equation shows that the mass of each ion reaching the detector is proportional to $B^{2}$. By adjusting the value of $B$ and keeping the term in the parentheses constant, ions of different masses are allowed to enter the detector. A graph of the detector output as a function of $B^{2}$ then gives an indication of what masses are present and the abundance of each mass.\n\nFig. 21.2 (b) shows a record obtained for naturally occurring neon gas showing three isotopes whose atomic mass numbers are 20,21 , and 22 . The larger is the peak, the more abundant is the isotope. Thus most abundant isotope of neon is neon-20.\n\n# 21.3 MASS DEFECT AND BINDING ENERGY\n\nIt is usually assumed that the whole is always equal to the sum of its parts. This is not so in the nucleus. The results of experiments on the masses of different nuclei show that the mass of the nucleus is always less than the total mass of all the protons and neutrons making up the nucleus. In the nucleus the missing mass is called the mass defect $m$ given by.\n\n$$\n\\Delta m=Z m_{n}+(A-Z) m_{n}-m_{\\text {nucleus }}\n$$\n\nAs $Z$ is the total number of protons in the nucleus and $m_{n}$ is the mass of a proton, then $Z m_{n}$ is the total mass of all the protons. As shown in Eq. 21.1, $(A-Z)$ is the total number of neutrons and as $m_{n}$ is the mass of a single neutron, $(A-Z) m_{n}$ is the total mass of all the neutrons. The term $m_{\\text {nucleus }}$ is the experimentally measured mass of the entire nucleus. Hence, Eq. 21.5 represents the difference in mass between the sum of the masses of its constituents and the mass of the nucleus itself.\nThe missing mass is converted to energy in the formation of the nucleus. This energy is found from Einstein's mass energy relation\n\n$$\nE=(\\Delta m) c^{2}\n$$\n\nand is called the binding energy (B.E.) of the nucleus. From equations 21.5 and 21.6 , the binding energy of a nucleus is\n\n$$\nB E_{i}=(\\Delta m) c^{2}=Z m_{n} c^{2}+(A-Z) m c_{n}^{2}-m c^{2}\n$$\n\n(b) (Proportional to atomic mass)\n\nFig 21.2 The mass spectrum of naturally occurring neon, showing thme isotopes whose atomic mass number are 20,21, and 22. The larger the peak, the more abundant the isotope.\n\nFor Your Information\nEnergy must be supplied to break the nucleus apart into its constituent protons and neutrons.\n\nLet us consider the example of the deuteron nucleus to make the concept of mass defect and binding energy more clear.\nExample 21.1: Find the mass defect and binding energy of the deuteron nucleus. The experimental mass of deuteron is $3.3435 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\n\n## Solution:\n\nUsing equation 21.5 , we get the mass defect of deuteron as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nm & =m_{p}+m_{n}-m_{D} \\\\\n=1.6726 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg}+1.6749 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg}-3.3435 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg} \\\\\n& =3.9754 \\times 10^{-30} \\mathrm{~kg}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe B.E. of deuteron as found from Eq. 21.6 is $\\Delta m c^{2}$\n$\\Delta m c^{2}=3.9754 \\times 10^{-30} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times\\left(3 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}\\right)^{2}=B . E .=3.5729 \\times 10^{-13} \\mathrm{~J}$\nTo express the result in eV units, divide the B.E. obtained in joules by $1.6 \\times 10^{-13} \\mathrm{~J}$. Thus\n\n$$\nB . E .=\\frac{3.5729 \\times 10^{-13} \\mathrm{~J}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}(\\mathrm{eV})^{-1}}=2.33 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{eV}=2.23 \\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the bound constituents have less energy than when they are free. That is the B.E. comes from the mass that is lost in the process of formation. Conversely, the binding energy is the amount of energy that must be supplied to a nucleus if the nucleus is to be broken up into protons and neutrons. Experiments have revealed that such mass defects exist in other elements as well. Shown in Fig. 21.3 is a graph between the mass defect per nucleon and charge\nFig. 21.3\n\nnumber $Z$ is obtained by finding the difference of mass between the total mass of all the protons and neutrons that form the nucleus and the experimental mass of the nucleus and dividing this difference by mass number $A$, i.e.,\nMass defect per nucleon\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta m}{A}=\\frac{m_{\\text {nucleus }}-\\left[Z m_{p}+(A-Z) m_{n}\\right]}{A}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta m$ is the mass defect. From the definition of mass defect it is quite obvious that for hydrogen, mass defect is zero. The mass defect is made clear with Einstein's equation $E=\\Delta m c^{2}$. This equation shows that if for any reason a mass $\\Delta m$ is lost, them it is converted into energy.\nLet us now calculate the BE of helium. For ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\Delta m=2 m_{n}+2 m_{n}-m_{\\mathrm{He}} \\\\\n=2.01519 u+2.01796 u-4.00281 u=0.03034 u\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nsince $1 u=1.66 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg}$\n$\\therefore \\quad \\Delta m=0.03034 \\mathrm{u} \\times 1.66 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{kgu}^{-1}=5.03 \\times 10^{-25} \\mathrm{~kg}$\nThus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { B.E. }=\\Delta m c^{2}=5.03 \\times 10^{-25} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 9 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2} \\\\\n= & 4.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~J}=\\frac{4.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~J}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}(\\mathrm{eV})^{-1}}=2.82 \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{eV}=28.2 \\mathrm{MeV}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis means that when two protons and two neutrons fuse together to make helium nucleus, if an amount of 28.2 MeV energy is given to the helium nucleus then it breaks up into two protons and two neutrons. From this, we conclude that\n\n$$\n1 u=1.6606 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg}=931 \\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\n\nIn this way we can calculate binding energy of every element. Shown in Fig. 21.4 is a graph between binding energy per nucleon and the inass number of different elements. This graph shows that the binding energy per nucleon increases\nNucleon number. $A$\n\nwith the mass number till it reaches a maximum value of 8.8 MeV at mass number 58 and then it gradually decreases to a value of 7.6 MeV at mass number 238. The binding energy per nucleon is maximum for iron. This shows that of all the elements iron is the most stable element. Later in this chapter it will be shown with the help of graph of Fig. 21.4 that when heavy element breaks into lighter elements or the lighter elements are fused to form heavier element then a large amount of energy can be obtained.\n\n# 21.4 RADIOACTIVITY\n\nIt has been observed that those elements whose charge number $Z$ is greater than 82 are unstable. Some invisible radiations, that can affect the photographic plates emanate out of these elements. Such elements are called radioactive and the phenomenon is called radioactivity. The radiations coming out of the radioactive elements are called alpha ( $\\alpha$ ), beta ( $\\beta$ ), and gamma ( $\\gamma$ ) radiation. Radioactivity was discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1896. He found that an ore containing uranium $(Z=92)$ emits an invisible radiation that penetrates through a black paper wrapping a photographic plate and affects the plate. After Becquerel's discovery Marie Curie and Pierre Curie discovered two new radioactive elements that they called polonium and radium.\nThe analysis of the radiations emanating out of a radioactive material can be carried out by a simple experiment. The radioactive material is placed at the centre of a block of lead by drilling a hole in the block. Radioactive radiations enter a vacuum chamber after emerging out of this hole. After passing between the two parallel plates the radiations strike a photographic plate. These radiations, instead of impinging at one point, fall at three different points due to the potential difference between the plates (Fig. 21.5).\nFrom this experiment it can be concluded that all radiations from the radioactive material are not alike. The radiation that bends towards the negative plate is made up of positively charged particles. These are called $\\alpha$-particles. Those radiations that bend towards the positive plate are composed of negatively charged particles. These are called $\\beta$-particles. Those radiations that go straight without bending have no\n\ncharge on them. These are called $\\gamma$-rays.\nFurther experiments reveal that $\\alpha$-particles are helium nuclei. The charge on them is $+2 e$ while their mass is 4 u (atomic mass unit) that is every $\\alpha$-particle has two protons and two neutrons in it. $\\beta$-particles are in fact fast moving electrons which come out of the nucleus of a radioactive element. $\\gamma$-rays like X-rays, are electromagnetic waves which issue out of the nucleus of a radioactive element. The wavelength of these rays is much shorter, compared with the wavelength of X-rays.\n\n## Nuclear Transmutation\n\nRadioactivity is purely a nuclear phenomenon. This is not affected by any physical or chemical reaction. Whenever any particle / radiation is emitted out of any radioactive element, it is always accompanied by some changes in the nucleus of the element. Therefore, this element changes into a new element. This phenomenon is called radioactive decay. The element formed due to this change is called daughter element. The original element is called the parent element. During the nuclear changes the laws of conservation of mass, energy, momentum and charge remain applicable.\nWe know that three types of radiations' $\\alpha$-particle, $\\beta$-particle and $\\gamma$-rays are emitted by the naturally occurring radioactive elements. When $\\alpha$-particle is emitted out of any nucleus then due to law of conservation of matter, the mass number of the nucleus decreases by 4 , and due to law of conservation of charge, the charge of the nucleus decreases by a magnitude of 2 e i.e., the charge number of the nucleus decreases by 2 . It is due to the fact that the mass number and charge number of the emitted particle $\\alpha$ is 4 and 2 respectively. The emission of the $\\alpha$-particle is represented by the following equation\n\n$$\n{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{X} \\longrightarrow{ }_{2-2}^{4-4} \\mathrm{Y}+{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}\n$$\n\nHere $X$ represents the parent and $Y$ the daughter element.\nTo explain the emission of $\\alpha$-particles we take the example of radium ${ }_{86}^{226} \\mathrm{Ra}$. The emission of an $\\alpha$-particle from radium 226 , results in the formation of radon gas ${ }_{86}^{222} \\mathrm{Rn}$. This change is represented by the following equation\n\n$$\n{ }_{86}^{226} \\mathrm{Ra} \\longrightarrow{ }_{86}^{222} \\mathrm{Rn}+{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}\n$$\n\nIt may be remembered that the sum of the mass numbers and the charge numbers on both sides of the\n\n## $\\alpha$ - decay occurs when an unstable parent nucleus emits an $\\alpha$ - particle and in the process it is converted into a different (or daughter) nucleus.\n\n## The emission of $\\alpha$-particle from Radium-226 results in the formation of Radon-222 gas.\nThe emission of $\\beta$-particle from Polonium-218 results in the formation of Astatine-218.\n\n## $\\beta$-decay occurs when a neutron in an unstable parent nucleus decays into a proton and an electron, the electron being emitted as the $\\beta$-particle. In the process the parent nucleus is transformed into daughter nucleus.\nequation are equal. When a $\\beta$-particle is emitted out of any nucleus, then its mass number does not undergo any change but its charge number increases by one. The emission of a $\\beta$-particle from any element $X$ is represented by the following equation\n\n$$\n2 \\mathrm{X} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{X}^{\\prime \\prime}+\\mathrm{e}\n$$\n\nNegative $\\beta$-particle is an electron and its emission from the nucleus becomes an incomprehensible enigma, as there is no electron present in the nucleus. However, the emission of électron from the nucleus can be thought of as a neutron emitting an electron and becoming a proton, although the modern explanation is not that simple.\n\nThis means that the $\\beta$-particle is formed at the time of emission. That is why at the time of emission of a $\\beta$-particle the charge number of the nucleus increases by one but no change in its mass number takes place as the mass of electron is exceedingly small as compared to the mass of a proton or a neutron. The transformation of an electron at the moment of its emission is given below by an equation\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathrm{n}} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H}+\\mathrm{e}\n$$\n\nIt has been observed that morium\ninto protactinium ${ }^{237} \\mathrm{~Pa}$ after the emission of $\\beta$-particle The following equation represents this reaction\n\n$$\n2 \\mathrm{Th} \\quad \\mathrm{Pat} \\mathrm{e}\n$$\n\nWhen a $\\gamma$-radiation issues out of nucleus then neither the charge number $Z$ not the mass number $A$ of the nucleus undergoes any change. It is due to the fact that a $\\gamma$-radiation is simply a photon that has neither any charge nor any mass. Its emission from the nucleus has some resemblance with the emission of a photon of light from an atom. We know that when any electron of an atom absorbs energy it jumps from the ground state to a higher energy state and the atom becomes excited. When the electron of this excited atom returns to its ground state then it emits the absorbed energy in the form of a photon. In much the same way the nucleus is sometimes excited to a higher state following the emission of $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$-particle. This excited state of the nucleus is unstable state, in coming back to its ground state from the excited state, $\\gamma$-radiation is emitted.\n\nThe emission of $\\gamma$-radiation from a nucleus is generally represented by this equation\n\n$$\n{ }_{2}^{4} X^{*} \\longrightarrow{ }_{2}^{4} X+\\gamma \\text { radiation }\n$$\n\nHere ${ }_{2}^{4} X^{*}$ represents an excited nucleus while ${ }_{2}^{4} X$ shows ground state of the nucleus.\n\n# 21.5 HALFLIFE\n\nWe have seen that whenever an $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$-particle is emitted from a radioactive element, it is transformed into some other element. This radioactive decay process is quite random and is not subjected to any symmetry. This means that we cannot foretell about any particular atom as to when will it decay. It could decay immediately or it may remain unchanged for millions of year. Thus we cannot say anything about the life of any particular atom of a radioactive element.\nLet us take the example of a city with a population of one million and we know that on the average ten person die every day. Even with this knowledge we cannot say with certainty that which particular person will die on which particular day. We can only say that on the whole ten person will die. The greater the population of the city, the greater the accuracy of such predictions. Like the population of a city, it is not possible to talk about an atom of a radioactive element. For more accurate result we always talk about large groups of atoms and laws of statistics are applied upon them. Let us suppose that we bring a group of 100,000 atoms under consideration and wait till such time that half of these i.e., 50,000 decay into their daughter element. This time is called the half-life $T_{1 / 2}$ of this element. If the half-life of the said element be one day, then after one day only 25,000 atoms will remain behind and after two days 12,500 atoms will remain behind. That is with the passage of every one day, the number of atoms remaining behind becomes half of the number already present. This example provides us the definition of half-life of a radioactive element i.e.,\n\"The half-life $T_{1 / 2}$ of a radioactive element is that period in which half of the atoms decay\".\n\nBesides getting the definition of half-life we can deduce two other conclusions from this example. These are, firstly no radioactive element can completely decay. It is due to the reason that in any half-life period only half of the nuclei decay and in this way an infinite time is required for all the atoms to decay.\n\nFig. 21.6 The half life $T_{02}$ of a radioactive decay is the time in which one-half of the radioactive nuclei disintegrate.\n\nSecondly, the number of atoms decaying in a particular period is proportional to the number of atoms present in the beginning of the period. If the number of atoms to start with is large then a large number of atoms will decay in this period and if the number of atoms present in the beginning is small then less atoms will decay.\nWe can represent these results with an equation. If at any particular time the number of radioactive atoms be N , then in an interval $\\Delta t$, the number of decaying atom, $\\Delta N$ is proportional to the time interval $\\Delta t$ and the number of atoms $N$, i.e..\n\n$$\n\\Delta N \\propto-N \\Delta t\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\Delta N=-\\lambda N \\Delta t\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the constant of proportionality and is called decay constant. Eq. 21.8 shows that if the decay constant of any element is large then in a particular interval more of its atoms will decay and if the constant $\\lambda$ is small then in that very interval less number of atoms will decay. From Eq. 21.8 we can define decay constant $\\lambda$ as given below\n\n$$\n\\lambda=-\\frac{\\Delta N / N}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nhere $\\Delta N / N$ is the fraction of the decaying atoms. Thus decay constant of any element is equal to the fraction of the decaying atoms per unit time. The unit of the decay constant is $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The negative sign in the Eq. 21.8 indicates the decrease in the number of atoms $N$.\n\nThe decay ability of any radioactive element can be shown by a graphic method also.\nWe know that every radioactive element decay at a particular rate with time. If we draw a graph between number of atoms in the sample of the radioactive element present at different times and the time then a curve as shown in Fig. 21.6 will be obtained. This graph shows that in the beginning the number of atoms present in the sample of the radioactive element was $\\mathrm{N}_{0}$, with the passage of time the number of these atoms decreased due to their decay. This graph is called decay curve.\nAfter a period of one half-life $\\mathrm{N}_{0} / 2$ number of atoms of this radioactive element are left behind. If we wait further for another half-period then half of the remaining $\\mathrm{N}_{0} / 2$ atoms decay, and $1 / 2 \\times \\mathrm{N}_{0} / 2=(1 / 2)^{2} \\mathrm{~N}_{0}$ atoms remain behind. After\n\nthe expiry of further period of a half-life, half of the remaining $(1 / 2)^{2} \\mathrm{~N}_{0}$ atoms decay. The number of atoms that remain undecayed is $1 / 2 \\times(1 / 2)^{2} \\mathrm{~N}_{0}=(1 / 2)^{2} \\mathrm{~N}_{0}$. We can conclude from this example that if we have $\\mathrm{N}_{0}$ number of any radioactive element then after a period of $n$ half-lives the number of atoms left behind is $(1 / 2)^{2} \\mathrm{~N}_{0}$.\n\nIt has been found that the estimate of decay of every radioactive element is according to the graph of Fig. 21.6 but the half-life of every radioactive element is different. For example the half-life of uranium-238 is $4.5 \\times 10^{6}$ years while the half-life of radium- 226 is 1620 years. The half-life of some radio active elements is very small, for example, the half-life of radon gas is 3.8 days and that of uranium-239 is 23.5 minutes.\n\nFrom the above discussion it is found that the estimate of any radioactive element can be made from its half-life or by determining its decay constant $\\lambda$. It can be proved with the help of calculus that the following relations exist between the decay constant $\\lambda$ and the half-life $T_{1 / 2}$\n\n$$\n\\lambda T_{1 / 2}=0.693\n$$\n\nEq. 21.9 shows that if the decay constant $\\lambda$ of any radioactive element is known, its half-life can be found.\n\nAny stable element, besides the naturally occurring radioactive element, can be made radioactive. For this very high energy particles are bombarded on the stable element. This bombardment excites the nuclei and the nuclei after becoming unstable become radioactive element. Such radioactive elements are called artificial radioactive elements.\nExample 21.2: lodine-131 is an artificial radioactive isotope. It is used for the treatment of human thyroid gland. Its half-life is 8 days. In the drug store of a hospital 20 mg of iodine-131 is present. It was received from the laboratory 48 days ago. Find the quantity of iodine-131 in the hospital after this period.\n\n# Solution:\n\nAs the half-life of iodine is 8 days, therefore in 8 days half of the iodine decays. Given below in the table is the amount of iodine present after every 8 days.\n\n| Interval in <br> days | Quantity of <br> lodine | Interval in <br> days | Quantity of <br> lodine |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 0 | 20 mg | 32 | 1.25 mg |\n| 8 | 10 mg | 40 | 0.625 mg |\n| 16 | 5 mg | 48 | 0.3125 mg |\n| 24 | 2.5 mg |  |  |\n\nThus 48 days after the receipt, the amount of iodine-131 left behind is only 0.3125 mg .\n\n# 21.6 INTERACTION OF RADIATION WITH MATTER\n\nAn $\\alpha$-particle travels a well defined distance in a medium before coming to rest. This distance is called the range of the particle. As the particle passes through a solid, liquid or gas, it loses energy due to excitation and ionization of atoms and molecules in the matter. The ionization may be due to direct elastic collisions or through electrostatic attraction. Ionization is the main interaction with matter to detect the particle or to measure its energy. The range depends on the\ni. charge, mass and energy of the particle and\nii. the density of the medium and ionization potentials of the atoms of the medium.\n\nSince $\\alpha$-particle is about 7000 times more massive than an electron, so it does not suffer any appreciable deflection from its straight path, provided it does not approach too closely to the nucleus of the atom. Thus $\\alpha$-particle continues producing intense ionization along its straight path till it loses all its energy and comes almost to rest. It, then, captures two electrons from the medium and becomes a neutral helium atom.\n$\\beta$-particles also lose energy by producing ionization. However, its ionizing ability is about 100 times less than that of $\\alpha$ particles. As a result its range is about 100 times more than $\\alpha$ particles. $\\beta$-particles are more easily deflected by collisions than heavy $\\alpha$-particles. Thus the path of $\\beta$-particles in matter is not straight but shows much straggling or scattering. The range of $\\beta$-particles is measured by the effective depth of penetration into the medium not by the length of erratic path. The more dense the material through which the particle moves, the shorter its range will be.\n\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$-particles both radiate energy as X-ray photons when they are slowed by the electric field of the charged particles in a solid material.\n\nPhotons of $\\gamma$-rays, being uncharged, cause very little ionization. Photons are removed from a beam by either scattering or absorption in the medium. They interact with matter in three distinct ways, depending mainly on their energy.\n(i) At low energies (less than about 0.5 MeV ), the dominant process that removes photons from a beam is the photoelectric effect.\n(ii) At intermediate energies, the dominant process is Compton scattering.\n(iii) At higher energies (more than 1.02 MeV ), the dominant process is pair production.\n\nIn air $\\gamma$-rays intensity falls off as the inverse square of the distance from the source, in much the same manner as light from a lamp. In solids, the intensity decreases exponentially with increasing depth of penetration into the material. The intensity $I_{n}$ of a beam after passing through a distance $x$ in the medium is reduced to intensity $I$ given by the relation $I=I_{n} \\mathrm{e}^{-x}$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the linear absorption coefficient of the medium. This coefficient depends on the energy of the photon as well as on the properties of the medium.\n\nCharged particles $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$-radiation produce fluorescence or glow on striking some substance like zinc sulphide, sodium iodide or barium platinocyanide coated screens.\n\"Fluorescence is the property of absorbing radiant energy of high frequency and reemitting energy of low frequency in the visible region of electromagnetic spectrum\".\n\nNeutrons, being neutral particles, are extremely penetrating particles. To be stopped or slowed, a neutron must undergo a direct collision with a nucleus or some other particle that has a mass comparable to that of the neutron. Materials such as water or plastic, which contain more low-mass nuclei per unit volume, are used to stop neutrons. Neutrons produce a little indirect ionization when they interact with materials containing hydrogen atoms and knock out protons.\n\nTable 21.1 The summary of the nature of $\\alpha, \\beta \\& \\gamma$ radiation\n\n| Characteristics | $\\alpha$-particles | $\\beta$-particles | $\\gamma$-rays |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 1.

Most detectors of radiation make use of the fact that ionization is produced along the path of the particle. These detectors include Wilson cloud chamber, Geiger counter and solid state detectors.\n\n## Wilson Cloud Chamber\n\nFig. 21.7\n\nIt is a device which shows the visible path of an ionizing particle. It makes use of the fact that supersaturated vapours condense preferentially on ions. If an ionizing particle passes through a region in which cloud droplets are about to form, the droplets will form first along the particle's path, showing the path as a trail of droplets. The apparatus consists of a cylindrical glass chamber closed at the upper end by a glass window and at the lower end by a movable piston (Fig. 21.7). A black felt pad soaked in alcohol is placed on a metal plate inside the chamber. The air soon becomes saturated with alcohol vapours. A rapid expansion is produced by pulling quickly the piston of the bicycle pump having the leather washer reversed so that it removes air. The sudden cooling resulted from adiabatic expansion helps to form supersaturated vapours. As radiation passes through the chamber, ions are produced along the path. The tiny droplets\n\nof moisture condense about these ions and form vapour tracks showing the path of the radiation. These are the atomic versions of the ice crystals left in the sky by a jet plane when suitable conditions exist. The fog tracks are illuminated with a lamp and may be seen or photographed through the glass window.\nThe $\\alpha$-particles leave thick, straight and continuous tracks due to intense ionization produced by them as shown in Fig. 21.8 (a), $\\beta$-particles form thin and discontinuous tracks extending in erratic manner showing frequent deflections (Fig. 21.8 b) and $\\gamma$-rays leave no definite tracks along their path (Fig. 21.8 c ). The length of the cloud tracks has been found proportional to the energy of the incident particle. A high potential difference of the order of 1 kV between the top and bottom of the chamber provides an electric field which clears away all the unwanted ions from the chamber to make it ready for use. The tracks seen are, therefore, those of rays that pass the chamber as the expansion occurs.\nThe chamber may be placed in a strong magnetic field which will bend the paths providing information about the charge, mass and energy of the radiating particle. In this way, it has helped in the discovery of many new particles.\n\n# Geiger-Muller Counter\n\nGeiger-Muller tube is a well-known radiation detector (Fig. 21.9 a). The discharge in the tube results from the ionization produced by the incident radiation. It consists of a stiff central wire acting as an anode in a hollow metal cylinder acting as a cathode filled with a suitable mixture of gas at about 0.1 atmospheric pressure. One end of the tube has a thin mica window to allow the entry of $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$-particles and other end is sealed by non-conducting material and carries the connecting pins for the two electrodes. A high potential difference, (about 400 V for neon-bromine filled tubes) but slightly less than that\n(a) $\\alpha$-Particle\n(b) $\\beta$-Particle\nFig. 21.9 (a)\n\nFig. 21.8 Cloud chamber tracks of $\\alpha, \\beta$, radiations\n\n(b) G.M. Tube with scaler unit Fig. 21.9\nnecessary to produce discharge through the gas is maintained between the electrodes. When radiation enters the tube, ionization is produced. The free electrons are attracted towards the positively charged central wire. As they are accelerated towards the wire by a strong electric field, they collide with other molecules of the gas and knock out more electrons which in turn do the same and produce a cascade of electrons that move towards the central wire. This makes a short pulse of electric current to pass through an external resistor. It is amplified and registered electronically. The counter, which also provides the power, is called a scaler.\nThe cascade of electrons produced by the entry of an ionizing particle is counted as a single pulse of approximately of the same size whatever the energy or path of the particle maybe. It cannot, thus, discriminate between the energies of the incident particle as output pulses are same. The entire electron pulse takes less than $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$. However, positive ions, being very massive than the electrons, take several hundred times as long to reach the outer cathode. During this time, called the dead time ( ${ }^{\\circ} 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~s}$ ) of the counter, further incoming particles cannot be counted. When positive ions strike the cathode, secondary electrons are emitted from the surface. These electrons would be accelerated to give further spurious counts. This is prevented by mixing a small amount of quenching gas with the principal gas.\nThe quenching gas must have an ionization potential lower than that of inert or principal gas. Thus, the ions of quenching gas reach the cathode before principal gas ions. When they reach near the cathode, they capture electrons and become neutral molecules. Following neutralization, the excess energy of the quenching molecules is dissipated in dissociation of the molecules rather than in the release of electrons from the cathode. For example, bromine gas is added to neon gas. The bromine molecules absorb energy from the ions or secondary electrons and dissociate into bromine atoms. The atoms then readily recombine into molecules again for the next pulse. The gas quenching is called self quenching. Although all commercial Geiger tubes are self quenched, it is common practice to use electronic quenching in addition. For this purpose, a large negative voltage is applied to the anode immediately after recording\n\nthe output pulse. This reduces the electric field bleow the critical value for ionization by collision. The negative voltage remains until all the positive ions are collected at cathode thus preventing secondary pulses.\nGeiger counter can be used to determine the range or penetration power of ionizing particles. The reduction in the count rate by inserting metal plates of varying thickness between the source and the tube helps to estimate the penetration power of the incident radiation.\nGeiger counter is not suitable for fast counting. It is because of its relatively long \"dead time\" of the order of more than a millisecond which limits the counting rate to a few hundred counts per second. If particles are incident on the tube at a faster rate, not all of them will be counted since some will arrive during the dead time. Solid state detectors are fast enough, more efficient and accurate.\n\n# Solid State Detector\n\nA solid state detector is a specially designed p-n Junction (Fig. 21.10) operating under a reversed bias in which electron-hole pairs are produced by the incident radiation to cause a current pulse to flow through the external circuit. The detector is made from a p-type silicon or germanium. An n type thin layer is produced by doping the top surface with donor type impurity. The top and bottom surfaces are coated with a thin layer of gold to make good conducting contact with external circuit. The combined thickness of n-type and gold layer absorbs so less energy of the incident particle that the junction may be assumed to be situated at the front surface. This is known as the surface barrier type detector. A reverse bias is applied through the two conducting layers of gold. This enlarges the charge free region around the junction called depletion region. Normally no current flows through the circuit. When an incident particle penetrates through the depletion region, it produces electron-hole pairs. These mobile charge carriers move towards the respective sides due to applied electric field. This gives rise to a current in the external circuit due to which a pulse of voltage is generated across the resistance $R$. This pulse is amplified and registered by a scaler unit. The size of the pulse is found proportional to the energy absorbed of the incident particle. The energy needed to produce an electronhole pair is about 3 eV to 4 eV which makes the device useful for detecting low energy particles. The collection time of electrons and holes is much less than gas filled counters and hence a solid state detector can count very fast. It is much smaller in size than any other detector and operates at low voltage. The above mentioned type detector is used for detecting $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$-particles but a specially designed device\nFig. 21.10\n\ncan be used for $\\gamma$-rays.\n\n# 21.8 NUCLEAR REACTIONS\n\nWhile studying radioactivity, we have seen that an $\\alpha$ particle is emitted from radium-226 and radon-222 is obtained. This nuclear change is represented by the following equation\n\n$$\n{ }_{88}^{226} \\mathrm{Ra} \\longrightarrow{ }_{86}^{222} \\mathrm{Rn}+{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}\n$$\n\nSuch an equation represents a nuclear reaction. Above mentioned nuclear reaction takes place on its own accord. However, it was Rutherford who, first of all, expressed his opinion that besides natural radioactive decay processes, other nuclear reactions can also occur. A particle $x$ is bombarded on any nucleus $X$ and this process yield a nucleus $Y$ and a light object y as given below\n\n$$\nX+x \\rightarrow Y+y\n$$\n\n## An alpha-proton nuclear reaction\n\nRutherford performed an experiment on the nuclear reaction in 1918. He bombarded $\\alpha$-particles on nitrogen. He observed that as a result of this reaction, oxygen is obtained and a proton is emitted. That is\n\n$$\n{ }_{7}^{14} \\mathrm{~N}+{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He} \\longrightarrow{ }_{8}^{17} \\mathrm{O}+{ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}\n$$\n\nThis reaction indicated that when $\\alpha$-particle enters the nucleus of ${ }_{7}^{14} \\mathrm{~N}$, then an excitation is produced in it. And as a result of it ${ }_{8}^{17} \\mathrm{O}$ and a proton are produced. Since the experiment of Rutherford, innumerable nuclear reactions have been observed. For nuclear reactions to take place, the fulfillment of certain conditions is a must.\n\nBefore and after any nuclear reaction the number of protons and neutrons must remain the same because protons and neutrons can neither be destroyed nor can they be created. We elaborate this point from the example of Rutherford's nuclear reaction of ${ }_{7}^{14} \\mathrm{~N}$ and ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$, here\n\n$$\n{ }_{7}^{14} \\mathrm{~N}+{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He} \\longrightarrow{ }_{8}^{17} \\mathrm{O}+{ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}\n$$\n\nNumber of protons $=7+2=8+1$\nNumber of neutrons $=7+2=9+0$\nA nuclear reaction can take place only when the total energy of the reactants including the rest mass energy is equal to the total energy of the products. For its explanations we again take the example of the nuclear reaction of Rutherford involving ${ }_{7}^{14} \\mathrm{~N}$ and ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$. In this reaction the mass of the reactants is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Mass of } \\frac{14}{7} \\mathrm{~N}=14.0031 \\mathrm{u} \\\\\n& \\text { Mass of } \\frac{4}{3} \\mathrm{He}=4.0026 \\mathrm{u}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTotal mass of the reactants $=18.0057 \\mathrm{u}$\nIn the same way the mass of the products is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Mass of } \\frac{17}{6} \\mathrm{O}=16.9991 \\mathrm{u} \\\\\n& \\text { Mass of } \\frac{1}{1} \\mathrm{H}=1.0078 \\mathrm{u}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTotal mass of the products after the reaction $=18.0069 \\mathrm{u}$\nThis shows that the total mass after the reaction is greater than the total mass before the reaction by 0.0012 u . We know that a 1 u mass $=931 \\mathrm{MeV}$ energy, therefore, a mass difference of 0.0012 u is equivalent to an energy of $931 \\mathrm{MeV} \\times 0.0012 \\mathrm{u}=1.13 \\mathrm{MeV}$. Hence this reaction is possible only when an additional mass of 0.0012 u is added into the reactants or the minimum kinetic energy of the $\\alpha$ particle is 1.13 MeV such as obtained from ${ }_{64}^{214} \\mathrm{Po}$. The energy of these $\\alpha$-particles is equal to 7.7 MeV which is greater than 1.13 MeV . Had these $\\alpha$-particles been obtained from a source that give out $\\alpha$-particles whose energy was less than 1.13 MeV then this reaction would not have taken place.\n\nFrom the conditions described above we can tell whether any nuclear reaction is possible or not. There is an interesting aspect in a nuclear reaction that it can take place in the opposite direction also. We know that ${ }_{8}^{17} \\mathrm{O}$ is obtained by the interaction ${ }_{7}^{14} \\mathrm{~N}$ with an $\\alpha$-particle of appropriate energy. If we accelerate protons, with the help of a machine like cyclotron, and increase their velocity and then bombard these high velocity protons on ${ }_{8}^{17} \\mathrm{O}$, Rutherford's nuclear reaction of ${ }_{7}^{14} \\mathrm{~N}$ and $\\alpha$-particle will proceed in the backward direction as\n\n$$\n{ }_{8}^{17} \\mathrm{O}+{ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H} \\longrightarrow{ }_{7}^{14} \\mathrm{~N}+{ }_{4}^{4} \\mathrm{He}\n$$\n\nBy bombarding different elements with $\\alpha$-particles, protons and neutrons, many nuclear reactions have been produced. Now we describe one such nuclear reaction with the help of which James Chadwick discovered neutron in 1932. When ${ }_{8}^{9} \\mathrm{Be}$ was bombarded with $\\alpha$-particles emitted out of ${ }_{64}^{210} \\mathrm{Po}$, then as a result of a nuclear reaction, ${ }_{6}^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ and a neutron were obtained. This reaction is shown below with an equation\n\n$$\n{ }_{4}^{9} \\mathrm{Be}+{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He} \\longrightarrow{ }_{6}^{12} \\mathrm{C}+{ }_{0}^{1} \\mathrm{n}\n$$\n\nAs neutron carries no charge, therefore, it presented a great amount of difficulty for its identification. Anyhow\n\nFig. 21.11\nwhen neutrons were passed through a block of paraffin, fast moving protons were ejected out and these were easily identified. It may be remembered that a large amount of hydrogen is present in paraffin and the nuclei of hydrogen atoms are protons. The emission of protons is the consequence of elastic collisions between the neutrons and the protons. This indicates that the mass of neutron is equal to the mass of the proton. It may be remembered that when an object of certain mass collides with another object of equal mass at rest, then as a result of elastic collision, the moving object comes to rest and the stationary object begins to move with the velocity of the colliding object. The discovery of neutron has brought in a revolution in nuclear reactions, as the neutrons carry no charge so they can easily enter the nucleus. Fig. 21.11 shows the arrangement of Chadwick's experiment for the discovery of neutron.\n\n# 21.9 NUCLEAR FISSION\n\nOtto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann of Gernany while working upon the nuclear reactions made a startling discovery. They observed that when slow moving neutrons are bombarded on ${ }^{235} \\mathrm{U}$, then as a result of the nuclear reaction ${ }_{36}^{141} \\mathrm{Ba},{ }_{32}^{92} \\mathrm{Kr}$ and an average of three neutrons are obtained. It may be remembered that the mass of both krypton and barium is less than that of the mass of uranium. This nuclear reaction was different from hither to studied other nuclear reactions, in two ways. First as a result of the breakage of the uranium nucleus, two nuclei of almost equal size are obtained, whereas in the other nuclear reactions the difference between the masses of the reactants and the products was not large. Secondly a very large amount of energy is given out in this reaction.\n\"Such a reaction in which a heavy nucleus like that of uranium splits up into two nuclei of roughly equal size along with the emission of energy during the reaction is called fission reaction\".\nFission reaction of ${ }_{32}^{235} \\mathrm{U}$ can be represented by the equation\n\n$$\n{ }_{92}^{235} \\mathrm{U}+{ }_{0}^{1} \\mathrm{n} \\longrightarrow{ }_{56}^{141} \\mathrm{Ba}+{ }_{36}^{92} \\mathrm{Kr}+3_{0}^{1} \\mathrm{n}+\\mathrm{Q}\n$$\n\nhere Q is the energy given out in this reaction. By comparing the total energy on the left side of the equation with total energy on the right side, we find that in the fission of one uranium nucleus about 200 MeV\n\nenergy is given out. It may be kept in mind that there is no difference between the sum of the mass and the charge numbers on both sides of the equation. Fission reaction is shown in Fig. 21.12 (a) and (b). Fission reaction can be easily explained with the help of graph of Fig. 21.4. This graph shows that the binding energy per nucleon is greatest for the middle elements of the periodic table and this binding energy per nucleon is a little less for the light or very heavy elements i.e., the nucleons in the light or very heavy elements are not so rigidly bound. For example the binding energy per nucleon for uranium is\n(a)\nFig. 21.12\nProcess of Fission reaction\nabout 7.7 MeV and the products of the fission reaction of uranium, namely barium and krypton, have binding energy of about 8.5 MeV per nucleon. Thus when a uranium nucleus breaks up, as a result of fission reaction, into barium and krypton, then an energy at the rate of $(8.5-7.6)=0.9 \\mathrm{MeV}$ per nucleon is given out. This means that an energy $235 \\times 0.9=211.5 \\mathrm{MeV}$ is given out in the fission of one uranium nucleus.\nThe fission process of uranium does not always produce the same fragments ( $\\mathrm{Ba}, \\mathrm{Kr}$ ). In fact any of the two nuclei present in the upper horizontal part of binding energy could be produced. Two possible fission reactions of uranium are given below as an example:\n\n$$\n{ }_{92}^{235} \\mathrm{U}+{ }_{0}^{1} \\mathrm{n} \\longrightarrow{ }_{50}^{132} \\mathrm{Sn}+{ }_{42}^{101} \\mathrm{Mo}+3{ }_{0}^{1} \\mathrm{n}+\\mathrm{Q}\n$$\n\nFig. 21.13\nFig 21.14\n${ }_{92}^{235} \\mathrm{U}+{ }_{0}^{1} \\mathrm{n} \\longrightarrow{ }_{54}^{140} \\mathrm{Xe}+{ }_{36}^{94} \\mathrm{Sr}+2{ }_{0}^{1} \\mathrm{n}+\\mathrm{Q}$\nHence in the uranium fission reaction several products may be produced. All of these products (fragments) are radioactive. Fission reaction is not confined to uranium alone; it is possible in many other heavy elements. However, it has been observed that fission takes place very easily with the slow neutrons in uranium-235 and plutonium-239, and mostly these two are used for fission purposes.\n\n# Fission Chain Reaction\n\nWe have observed that during fission reaction, a nucleus of uranium-235 absorbs a neutron and breaks into two nuclei of almost equal masses besides emitting two or three neutrons. By properly using these neutrons fission reaction can be produced in more uranium atoms such that a fission reaction can continuously maintain itself. This process is called fission chain reaction. Suppose that we have a definite amount of ${ }_{92}^{235} \\mathrm{U}$ and a slow neutron originating from any source produces fission reaction in one atom of uranium. Out of this reaction about three neutrons are emitted. If conditions are appropriate these neutrons produce fission in some more atoms of uranium. In this way this process rapidly proceeds and in an infinitesimal small time a large amount of energy along with huge explosion is produced. Fig. 21.13 is the representation of fission chain reaction.\n\nIt is possible to produce such conditions in which only one neutron, out of all the neutrons created in one fission reaction, becomes the cause of further fission reaction. The other neutrons either escape out or are absorbed in any other medium except uranium. In this case the fission chain reaction proceeds with its initial speed. To understand these conditions carefully look at Fig. 21.14. In Fig. 21.14 (a) a fission reaction in a thin sheet of ${ }_{92}^{235} \\mathrm{U}$ is shown to be in progress. The resulting neutrons scatter in the air and so they cannot produce any fission chain reaction. Fig. 21.14 (b) shows some favourable conditions for chain reaction. Some of the neutrons produced in the first fission reaction produce only one more fission reaction but here also no chain reaction is produced. In Fig. 21.14 (c) a sphere of ${ }_{92}^{235} \\mathrm{U}$ is shown. If the sphere is sufficiently big, then most of the neutrons produced by the fission reaction get absorbed in ${ }_{92}^{235} \\mathrm{U}$ before they escape out of the sphere and produce chain reaction. Such a\n\nmass of uranium in which one neutron, out of all the neutrons produced in one fission reaction, produces further fission is called critical mass. The volume of this mass of uranium is called critical volume.\n\nIf the mass of uranium is much greater than the critical mass, then the chain reaction proceeds at a rapid speed and a huge explosion is produced. Atom bomb works at this principle. If the mass of uranium is less than the critical mass, the chain reaction does not proceed. If the mass of uranium is equal to the critical mass, the chain reaction proceeds at its initial speed and in this way we get a source of energy. Energy, in an atomic reactor, is obtained according to this principle. The chain reaction is not allowed to run wild, as in an atomic bomb but is controlled by a series of rods, usually made of cadmium, that are inserted into the reactor. Cadmium is an element that is capable of absorbing a large number of neutrons without becoming unstable or radioactive. Hence, when the cadmium control rods are inserted into the reactor, they absorb neutrons to cut down on the number of neutrons that are available for the fission process. In this way the fission reaction is controlled.\n\n## Nuclear Reactor\n\nIn a nuclear power station the reactor plays the same part as does furnace in a thermal power station. In a furnace, coal or oil is burnt to produce heat, while in a reactor fission reaction produces heat. When fission takes place in the atom of uranium or any other heavy atom, then an energy at the rate of 200 MeV per nucleus is produced. This energy appears in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments. These fast moving fragments besides colliding with one another also collide with the uranium atoms. In this way their kinetic energy gets transformed in heat energy. This heat is used to produce steam which in turn rotates the turbine. Turbine rotates the generator which produces electricity. A sketch of a nuclear power station is shown in Fig. 21.15.\n\nFor Your information\nIn a controlled chain reaction, only one neutron, on average, from each fission event causes another nucleus to fission. As a result, energy is released at a steady or controlled rate.\n\nFig. 21.15\nA reactor usually has four important parts. These are:\n\n1. The most important and vital part of a reactor is called core. Here the fuel is kept in the shape of cylindrical tubes. Reactor fuels are of various types. Uranium was used as fuel in the elementary reactors. In this fuel the quantity of ${ }_{92}^{235} \\mathrm{U}$ is increased from 2 to 4 percent. It may be remembered that the quantity of ${ }_{92}^{235} \\mathrm{U}$ in the naturally occurring uranium is only 0.7 percent. Now-a-days plutonium-239 and uranium233 are also being used as fuel.\n2. The fuel rods are placed in a substance of small atomic weight, such as water, heavy water, carbon or hydrocarbon etc. These substances are called moderators. The function of these moderators is to slow down the speed of the neutrons produced during the fission process and to direct them towards the fuel. Heavy water, it may be remembered, is made of ${ }_{2}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$, a heavy isotope of hydrogen instead of ${ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}$. The neutrons produced in the fission reaction are very fast and energetic and are not suitable for producing fission in reactor fuel like ${ }_{92}^{235} \\mathrm{U}$ or ${ }_{94}^{239} \\mathrm{Pu}$ etc. For this purpose slow neutrons are more useful. To achieve this, moderators are used.\n3. Besides moderator there is an arrangement for the control of number of neutrons, so that of all the\n\nneutrons produced in fission, only one neutron produces further fission reaction. The purpose is achieved either by cadmium or by boron because they have the property of absorbing fast neutrons. The control rods made of cadmium or boron are moved in or out of the reactor core to control the neutrons that can initiate further fission reaction. In this way the speed of the chain reaction is kept under control. In case of emergency or for repair purposes control rods are allowed to fall back into the reactor and thus stop the chain reaction and shut down the reactor.\n4 Heat is produced due to chain reaction taking place in the core of the reactor. The temperature of the core, therefore, rises to about $500^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. To produce steam from this heat, it is transported to heat exchanger with the help of water, heavy water or any other liquid under high pressure. In the heat exchanger this heat is used to produce high temperature steam from ordinary water. The steam is then used to run the turbine which in turn rotates the generator to produce electricity. The temperature of the steam coming out of the turbine is about $300^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. This is further cooled to convert it into water again. To cool this steam, water from some river or sea is, generally, used. In Karachi nuclear power plant (KANUP), heavy water is being used as a moderator and for the transportation of heat also from the reactor core to heat exchanger, heavy water is used. To cool steam coming out of the turbine, sea water is being used.\nThe nuclear fuel once used for charging the reactor can keep on operation continuously for a few months. There after the fissile material begins to decrease. Now the used fuel is removed and fresh fuel is fed instead. In the used up fuel intensely radioactive substances remain. The half-life of these radioactive remnant materials is many thousand years. The radiations and the particles emitted out of this nuclear waste is very injurious and harmful to the living things. Unfortunately there is no proper arrangement of the disposal of the nuclear waste. This cannot be dumped into oceans or left in any place where they will contaminate the environment, such as through the soil or the air. They must not be allowed to get into the drinking water. The best place so far found to store these wastes is in the bottom of old salt\n\nAn induced nuclear reaction in which ${ }_{92}^{238} \\mathrm{U}$ is transmuted into the transuranium element plutonium ${ }_{93}^{236} \\mathrm{Pu}$.\nmines, which are very dry and are thousands of metres below the surface of the Earth. Here they can remain and decay without polluting the environment.\n\n## Types of Reactors\n\nThere are two main types of nuclear reactors. These are:\n(i) Thermal reactors\n(ii) Fast reactors\n\nThe thermal reactors are called \"thermal\" because the neutrons must be slowed down to \"thermal energies\" to produce further fission. They use natural uranium or slightly enriched uranium as fuel. Enriched uranium contains a greater percentage of U-235 than natural uranium does. There are several designs of thermal reactors. Pressurized water reactors (PWR) are the most widely used reactors in the world. In this type of reactors, the water is prevented from boiling, being kept under high pressure. This hot water is used to boil another circuit of water which produces steam for turbine rotation of electricity generators.\nFast reactors are designed to make use of U-238, which is about $99 \\%$ content of natural uranium. Each U-238 nucleus absorbs a fast neutron and changes to plutonium-239.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& { }_{92}^{238} \\mathrm{U}+{ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{n} \\longrightarrow{ }_{93}^{239} \\mathrm{~Np}+{ }_{1}^{0} \\beta \\\\\n& { }_{93}^{239} \\mathrm{~Np} \\longrightarrow{ }_{94}^{239} \\mathrm{Pu}+{ }_{-1}^{0} \\beta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nPlutonium can be fissioned by fast neutrons, hence, moderator is not needed in fast reactors. The core of fast reactors consists of a mixture of plutonium and uranium dioxide surrounded by a blanket of uranium-238.\nNeutrons that escape from the core interact with uranium238 in the blanket, producing thereby plutonium-239. Thus more plutonium fuel is bred in this way and natural uranium is used more effectively.\n\n### 21.10 FUSION REACTION\n\nWe know that the energy given out per nucleon per fission of heavy element like that of uranium is 0.9 MeV . It is due to the fact that the binding energy per nucleon of the fission fragments is greater than uranium. In fact energy is obtained from any nuclear reaction in which the binding energy per nucleon of the products increases. Is there any other reaction besides the fission reaction from which energy could be obtained? In order to answer this question we must ponder\n\nover Fig. 21.4 again. Thisgraph shows that the binding energy per nucleon increases upto $A=50$. Hence when two light nuclei merge together to form a heavy nucleus whose mass number $A$ is less than 50 , then energy is given out. In section on \"Mass Defect and Binding Energy\" we have observed that when two protons and two neutrons merge to form a helium nucleus, then about 28 MeV energy is given out.\n\n# \"Such a nuclear reaction in which two light nuclei merge to form a heavy nucleus is called fusion reaction\".\n\nDuring a fusion reaction some mass is lost and its equivalent energy is given out. In a fusion reaction, more energy per nucleon can be obtained as compared to the fission reaction. But unfortunately it is comparatively more difficult to produce fusion. Two positively charged light nuclei must be brought very close to one another. To do so work has to be done against the electrostatic force of repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. Thus a very large amount of energy is required to produce fusion reaction. It is true that a greater amount of energy can be obtained during a fusion reaction compared to that produced during a fission reaction, but in order to start this reaction a very large amount of energy is spent. On the contrary no difficulty is faced to start the fission reaction because neutron has no charge on it and it has to face no repulsive force while reaching the nucleus.\nLet us now take the example of a fusion reaction when two deuterons are merged to form a helium nucleus, 24 MeV energy is released during this process i.e.,\n\n$$\n{ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}+{ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H} \\longrightarrow{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}+24 \\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\n\nBut there is a very little chance of the formation of ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$ nucleus by the merger of two deuterons. The probability of occurring such a reaction is great where one proton or one neutron is produced as given below:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& { }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}+{ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H} \\longrightarrow{ }_{1}^{4} \\mathrm{H}+{ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}+4.0 \\mathrm{MeV} \\\\\n& { }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}+{ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H} \\longrightarrow{ }_{2}^{3} \\mathrm{He}+{ }_{0}^{1} \\mathrm{n}+3.3 \\mathrm{MeV}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn both of these reactions about 1.0 MeV energy per nucleon is produced which is equal to the energy produced during fission. If ${ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ and ${ }_{1}^{4} \\mathrm{H}$ are forced to fuse then 17.6 MeV energy is obtained i.e.,\n\n$$\n{ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}+{ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H} \\longrightarrow{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}+{ }_{0}^{1} \\mathrm{n}+17.6 \\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\n\nWe know that for fusion of two light nuclei the work has to be\n\n## Ozone on the surface of Earth is a corrosive and poisonous gas but at the height of $20-50 \\mathrm{~km}$ from the Earth surface becomes vital to life as it absorbs almost all u.v. radiations which are harmful to living things.\n\n## Ultra violet radiations cause\n(i) Sunburn, blindness and skin cancer\n(ii) Severe crop damage\n(iii) decay of micro-organisms\n(iv) disrupt the ocean ecosystem\ndone to overcome the repulsive force which exists between them. For this the two nuclei are hurled towards one another at a very high speed. One method to do so is to give these nuclei a very large velocity with the help of an accelerator. This method has been used in the research study of nuclear fusion of ${ }_{2}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ and ${ }_{2}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$. But this method of nuclear fusion for getting energy cannot be used on a large scale.\nThere is another method to produce fusion reaction It is based upon the principle that the speed of atoms of a substance increases with the increase in the temperature of that substance. To start a fusion reaction the temperature at which the required speed of the light nuclei can be obtained is about 10 million degrees celsius. At such extraordinarily high temperature the reaction that takes place is called thermonuclear reaction. Ordinarily such a high temperature cannot be achieved. However during the explosion of am atom bomb this temperature can be had for a very short time.\nUntil now the fusion reaction is taking place only in a hydrogen bomb. That extraordinary high temperature is obtained during the explosion of an atom bomb, due to this high temperature the fusion reaction between ${ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ and ${ }_{2}^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ sets in. In this way a very large amount of energy is given out with the explosion.\nA very large amount of energy can be had from a fusion reaction, but till now this reaction has not been brought under control like a fission reaction and so is not being used to produce electricity. Efforts are in full swing in this field and it is hoped that in near future some method would be found to control this reaction as well.\n\n## Nuclear Reaption in the Sun\n\nThe Sun is composed primarily of hydrogen. It has a little amount of helium and a slight amount of other heavy elements. A tremendous amount of energy keeps issuing out of it continuously at all times. The temperature of its core is about 20 million degrees celsius and its surface temperature is about 6000 degrees celsius. Its energy is due to fusion reaction called p-p reaction. During this process two hydrogen nuclei or two protons fuse to from deuteron. This reaction takes place as\n\n$$\n{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{H}+{ }_{2}^{2} \\mathrm{H} \\longrightarrow{ }_{2}^{2} \\mathrm{H}+{ }_{2}^{0} \\mathrm{e}+\\text { Energy }\n$$\n\nWith the fusion reaction of deuteron with proton, ${ }_{2}^{3} \\mathrm{He}$ an isotope of helium is formed i.e.,\n\n$$\n{ }_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{H}+{ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H} \\longrightarrow{ }_{2}^{3} \\mathrm{He}+\\gamma+\\text { Energy }\n$$\n\nIn the last stage the two nuclei of ${ }_{2}^{3} \\mathrm{He}$ react in the following manner:\n\n$$\n{ }_{2}^{3} \\mathrm{He}+{ }_{2}^{3} \\mathrm{He} \\longrightarrow{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}+{ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}+{ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}+\\text { Energy }\n$$\n\nIn this reaction six protons take part and finally a helium nucleus and two protons are formed. That is, the result of different stages of this reaction is that four protons have formed one helium nucleus. It has been estimated that in this p-p chain reaction, 25.7 MeV energy is given out i.e., 6.4 MeV per nucleon energy is obtained which is much greater than the energy given out per nucleon ( 1 MeV ) during a fission reaction.\n\n### 21.11 RADIATION EXPOSURE\n\nWhen a Geiger tube is used in any experiment, it records radiation even when a radioactive source is nowhere near it. This is caused by radiation called background radiation. It is partly due to cosmic radiation which comes to us from outer space and partly from naturally occurring radioactive substance in the Earth's crust. The cosmic radiation consists of high energy charged particles and electromagnetic radiation. The atmosphere acts as a shield to absorb some of these radiations as well as ultraviolet rays. In recent past, the depletion of ozone layer in the upper atmosphere has been detected which particularly filters ultraviolet rays reaching us. This may result in increased eye and skin diseases. The depletion of ozone layer is suspected to be caused due to excessive release of some chemicals in the atmosphere such as chloroflourocarbons (CFC) used in refrigeration, aerosol spray and plastic foam industry. Its use is now being replaced by environmentally friendly chemicals. Many building materials contain small amounts of radioactive isotopes. Radioactive radon gas enters buildings from the ground. It gets trapped inside the building which makes radiation levels much higher from radon inside than outside. A good ventilation can reduce radon level inside the building. All types of food also contain a little radioactive substance. The most common are potassium- 40 and carbon- 14 isotopes.\nSome radiation in the environment is added by human activities. Medical practices, mostly diagnostic X-ray probably contribute the major portion to it. It is an unfortunate fact that many X-ray exposures such as routine chest X-ray\n\n## Ple-chan showing proportion of radiation from different sources absorbed by average person.\n\n## Do You Know? ?:\n\nThis symbol is universally used to indicate an area where radioactivity is being handled or artificial radiations are being produced.\n\nhospitals, research and industrial establishments, colour television, luminous watches and tobacco leaves. A smoker not only inhales toxic smoke but also hazardous radiation. Low level background radiation from natural sources is normally considered to be harmless. However, higher levels of exposure are certainly damaging. We cannot avoid exposure to radiation. However, the best advice is to avoid unnecessary exposure to any kind of ionizing radiation.\n\n# 21.12 BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF RADIATION\n\n## Table 21.2\n\nRelative Biological Effectiveness (RBE)\n\n| Radiation | RBE |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| X-rays, y-rays and o-particles | 1.0 |\n| of 30 keV or more | 1.7 |\n| o-particles of less than 30 keV | 10 (body) |\n| Neutrons and protons below 10 | 30 (eyes) |\n| MeV | 10 |\n| o-particles from natural | 20 |\n| radioactivity |  |\n\nTo study the effects of radiation, we need to define some of the units of radiation. The strength of the radiation source is indicated by its activity measured in becquerel (Bq). One becquerel is one disintegration per second. A larger unit is curie (Ci) which equals $3.7 \\times 10^{10}$ disintegrations per second. The effect of radiation on a body absorbing it relates to a quantity called absorbed dose $D$ defined as the energy $E$ absorbed from ionizing radiation per unit mass $m$ of the absorbing body.\n\n$$\nD=\\frac{E}{m}\n$$\n\nIts SI unit is gray (Gy) defined as one joule per kilogram.\n\n$$\n1 \\mathrm{~Gy}=1 \\mathrm{Jkg}\n$$\n\nAn old unit is rad, an acronym for radiation absorbed dose.\n\n$$\n1 \\mathrm{rad}=0.01 \\mathrm{~Gy}\n$$\n\nEqual doses of different radiations do not produce same biological effect. For the same absorbed dose, $\\alpha$-particles are 20 times more damaging than X-rays. The effect also depends on the part of the body absorbing the radiation. For example, neutrons are particularly more damaging to eyes than other parts of the body. To allow this, the absorbed dose is multiplied by a quality factor known as relative biological effectiveness or RBE (Table 21.2). The equivalent dose $D_{e}$ of any absorbed radiation is defined as the product of absorbed dose and RBE of the kind of radiation being absorbed.\n\n$$\nD_{e}=D \\times \\mathrm{RBE}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of equivalent dose is sievert (Sv).\n\n$$\n1 \\mathrm{~Sv}=1 \\mathrm{~Gy} \\times \\mathrm{RBE}\n$$\n\nAn old unit, the rem is equal to 0.01 Sv .\n\n$$\n1 \\mathrm{rem}=0.01 \\mathrm{~Sv}\n$$\n\nThe background radiation to which we are exposed, on the average, is 2 mSv per year. Doses of 3 Sv will cause radiation burns to the skin. For workers in the nuclear facilities or mines, a weekly dose of 1 mSv is normally considered safe (Table 21.3).\n\nThe damage from $\\alpha$-particles is small unless the source enters the body. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$-particles can cause redness and sores on the skin. Some other low level radiation effects are loss of hair, ulceration, stiffening of the lungs, and a drop in the white blood cells which is followed by a sickness pattern of diarrhea, vomiting and fever known as radiation sickness (Fig. 21.16). High levels of radiation may disrupt the blood cells seriously leading to diseases such as anaemia and leukaemia. Chromosome abnormalities or mutation may cause delayed genetic effects such as cancer, eye cataracts and abnormalities in the future generations. These may develop many years after exposure to harmful radiation.\nExample 21.3: How much energy is absorbed by a man of mass 80 kg who receives a lethal whole body equivalent dose of 400 rem in the form of low energy neutrons for which RBE factor is 10 ?\n\n| Table 21.3 |  |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| Averagc radation doses from a number of common sources of ionizing radation |  |\n| Types of Exposure | mSv |\n| Watching television for a year | 10 |\n| Radiation from nuclear power stations for a year | 10 |\n| Wearing a radioactive luminous watch for a year (now not very common) | 30 |\n| Having a chest X-ray | 200 |\n| Radiation from a brick house per year | 750 |\n| Maximum dose allowed to general public from artificial sources per year | 1000 |\n| Working for a month of a uranium mine | 1000 |\n| Typical dose received by a member of the general public in a year from all sources | 2500 |\n| Maximum dose allowed to workers exposed to radiation per year | 50000 |\n\nFig 21.16 The effects of exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation\n\nFilm badge dosimeter are used to monitor radiation received by workers in nuclear facilities.\n\n## Radioactive wastes are of three types i.e., high level, medium and low level. All these wastes are dangerous for ground water and land environment.\n\n## It is very difficult to dispose off radioactive waste safely due to their long half lives e.g., 'Pu' half life is 24,000 years, therefore, it remains dangerous for about 1.92 .000 years.\n\n## Solution:\n\nRBE factor $=10$\n\n$$\nD_{s}=400 \\mathrm{rem}=400 \\times 0.01 \\mathrm{~Sv}=4 \\mathrm{~Sv} \\quad ; \\quad D=7\n$$\n\nUsing Eq. 21.4\n\n$$\nD=\\frac{D_{s}}{\\mathrm{RBE}}=\\frac{4 \\mathrm{~Sv}}{10}=0.4 \\mathrm{~Gy}\n$$\n\nSince 1 Gy is $1 \\mathrm{~J} \\mathrm{~kg}^{-1}$, hence total energy absorbed by the whole body $=m D=80 \\times 0.4 \\mathrm{~Gy}=32 \\mathrm{~J}$\n\nIt is a very small amount of thermal energy. Obviously, the damage done by ionizing radiation has nothing to do with thermal energy. The harmful effects arise due to disruption of the normal functions of the tissues in which it is absorbed.\n\n## 21.13 BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL USES OF RADIATION\n\nRadioisotopes of many elements can be made easily by bombardment with neutrons and other particles. As such isotopes have become available and are inexpensive, their use in medicine, agriculture, scientific research and industries has expanded tremendously.\nRadioisotopes are used to find out what happens in many complex chemical reactions and how they proceed. Similarly in biology, they have helped in investigating into chemical reactions that take place in plants and animals. By mixing a small amount of radioactive isotope with fertilizer, we can easily measure how much fertilizer is taken up by a plant using radiation detector. From such measurements, farmers know the proper amount of fertilizer to use. Through the use of radiation-induced mutations, improved varieties of certain crops such as rice, chickpea, wheat and cotton have been developed. They have improved plant structure. The plants have shown more resistance to diseases and pest, and give better yield and grain quality. Radiation is also used to treat cancers. Radioactive tracers and imaging devices have helped in the understanding and diagnosis of many diseases.\n\n## Tracer Techniques\n\nA radioactive isotope behaves in just the same way as the normal isotope inside a living organism. But the location and concentration of a radioactive isotope can be determined easily by measuring the radiation it emits. Thus, a radioactive\n\nisotope acts as an indicator or tracer that makes it possible to follow the course of a chemical or biological process. The technique is to substitute radioactive atoms for stable atoms of the same kind in a substance and then to follow the 'tagged' atoms with the help of radiation detector in the process. Tracers are widely used in medicine to detect malignant tumors and in agriculture to study the uptake of a fertilizer by a plant. For example, if a plant is given radioactive carbon-14, it will use it in exactly the same way as it always uses stable carbon-12. But the carbon-14 releases $\\beta$-radiations and thus by measuring radioactivity in different parts of the plant, the path taken by the carbon atoms can be known. This technique has helped to understand more elaborately the complex process of photosynthesis. The tracer technique was also used to identify faults in the underground pipes of the fountain system of the historical Shalimar gardens of Lahore by the scientists of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.\n\n## Medical Diagnostics and Therapy\n\nTracers are widely used in medicine to study the process of digestion and the way chemical substances move about in the body.\n\nSome chemicals such as hydrogen and sodium present in water and food are distributed uniformly throughout the body. Certain other chemicals are selectively absorbed by certain organs. Radio-iodine, for example, is absorbed mostly by the thyroid gland, phosphorus by bones and cobalt by liver. They can serve as tracers. Small quantity of low activity radioisotope mixed with stable isotope is administered by injection or otherwise to a patient and its location in diseased tissue can be ascertained by means of radiation detectors. For example, radioactive iodine can be used to check that a person's thyroid gland is working properly. A diseased or hyperactive gland absorbs more than twice the amount of normal thyroid gland. A similar method can be used to study the circulation of blood using radioactive isotope sodium-24.\nExperiments on cancerous cells have shown that those cells that multiply rapidly absorb more radiation and are more easily destroyed than normal cells by ionizing radiation. Radiotherapy with $\\gamma$-rays from cobalt-60 is often used in the treatment of cancer. The $\\gamma$-rays are carefully focussed on to the malignant tissue. Strict safety precautions are necessary\n\nTable 21.4\n\n| Isotope | Half-life | Gamma energies | Example of use |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Sodium ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{Na}$ | 18 hours | 1.37, 2.75 | Plasma volume |\n| Iron ${ }^{15} \\mathrm{Fe}$ | 45 days | $\\begin{aligned} & 1.29,1.10 \\\\ & 0.19 \\end{aligned}$ | Iron in Plasma |\n| Technetium ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{Te}$ | 6 hqurs | 0.14 | Thyrbid uptake scans |\n| Iodine ${ }^{17}$ | 8 days | $\\begin{aligned} & 0.72,0.64 \\\\ & 0.36,0.26 \\\\ & 0.08 \\end{aligned}$ | Kidney tests |\n| Iodine ${ }^{18}$ | 60 days | 0.035 | Plasma volume <br> Veh flow |\n\nFig. 21.17\nfor both patient and attendant medical staff. Radioactive iodine-131 is used to combat cancer of the thyroid gland. Since iodine tends to collect in the thyroid gland, radioactive isotopes lodge where they can destroy the malignant cells. In some cases encapsulated \"seeds\" are implanted in the malignant tissue for local and short ranged treatment. For skin cancers, phosphorus- 32 or strontium- 90 may be used instead. These produce $\\beta$-radiation. The dose of radiation has to be carefully controlled otherwise the radiation could do more damage than help. Patients undergoing radiation treatment often feel ill, because the radiation also damages the healthy cells.\n\n## Radiography\n\nThe $\\gamma$-rays radiographs are used in medical diagnosis such as internal imaging of the brain to determine precisely the size and location of a tumor or other parts of the body. Cracks or cavities in castings or pipes can also be detected by scanning. Any sudden increase in count rate indicates a cavity within the object.\n\nThe gamma camera is designed to detect $\\gamma$-radiations from sites in the body where a $\\gamma$-emitting isotope is located. An image as shown in Fig. 21.17, consisting of many dots of the $\\gamma$-emitting sources in the patient body is formed. The camera can also be used to obtain a sequence of images to observe an organ such as a kidney in action.\n\n### 21.14 BASIC FORCES OF NATURE\n\nThe man has always desired to comprehend the complexity of nature in terms of as few elementary concepts as possible. Among his quest, in Feynman's words, has been the one for \"wheels within wheels\", the task of Natural Philosophy being to discover the inner most wheels if any such exist. A second quest has concentrated itself with the fundamental forces, which make the wheels go round and enmesh with one another.\nAlthough we have been familiar with the basic forces and about some of the basic building blocks of the matter, but here we are going to study the modern concepts about both of these. We know that the basic forces are:\n\n1. Gravitational force\n2. Magnetic force\n3. Electric force\n4. Weak nuclear force\n5. Strong nuclear force\n\nThe electric and magnetic forces were unified to get an electromagnetic force by Faraday and Maxwell, who were able to prove that a current is induced in a coil whenever the magnetic flux passing through the coil is changed; leaving behind four fundamental forces, the strong nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force and the gravitational force. These four fundamental forces of nature have seemed for some time quite different from one another. Despite its different effective strength, the strong nuclear force is effective only withir sub-nuclear distances and therefore, confines the neutrons and protons within the nucleus. The electromagnetic force is long-range and causes all chemical reactions. It binds together atoms, molecules, crystals, trees, buildings and you. This force acting on a microscopic level is responsible for a variety of apparently different macroscopic forces such as friction, cohesion and adhesion. The weak nuclear force is short range, like the strong nuclear force, and is responsible for spontaneous breaking up of the radioactive elements. It is a sort of repulsive force of very short range $\\left(10^{-17} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$. It is usually masked by the effect of the strong and electromagnetic forces inside the nuclei. The gravitational force, like the electromagnetic force, is again long range, extending upto and beyond the remotest stars and galaxies. It keeps you, the atmosphere and the seas fixed to the surface of the planet. It gives rise to the ocean tides and keeps the planets moving in their orbits around the Sun.\nThese widely disparate properties of the four basic forces have not stopped the scientists from finding a common cause for them all.\nOne hundred years after the unification of electric and magnetic forces into electromagnetic force, in 1979, the physics nobel prize was conferred on Glashow, Weinberg and Abdus Slam for the unification of electromagnetic and weak forces.\n\nIt is further expected that a strong nuclear force will eventually unite with electroweak force to make up a single entity resulting in the grand unified electro-nuclear force.\n\n### 21.15 BUILDING BLOCKS OF MATTER\n\nAccording to standard model of particle Physics, subatomic particles can be classified into four groups:\n(i) Hadrons (ii) Leptons (iii) Gauge boson (iv) Higgs boson\n\nFor Your Information\nComposition of Matter\nTable 21.5\nQuarks and Antiquarks\n\n| Name | Symbol | Charge |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| Up | $u$ | $+10$ |\n| Down | $d$ | $+10$ |\n| Strange | $s$ | $+10$ |\n| Charm | $c$ | $+10$ |\n| Top | $t$ | $+10$ |\n| Bottom | $b$ |  |\n\nElementary particles are the basic building blocks of matter. All photons and leptons are elementary particles. Hadrons are not elementary particles but are composed of elementary particles called quarks. It is now believed that stable matter can be described using six quarks, six leptons and their antiparticles.\n\n## Hadrons\n\nHadrons are particles that experience the strong nuclear force. In addition to protons, neutrons and mesons are hadrons. The particles equal in mass or greater than protons are called baryons and those lighter than protons are called mesons. A pair of quark and antiquark makes a meson and 3 quarks make a baryon. It is proposed that there are six quarks, (1) up (2) down (3) strange (4) charm (5) bottom and (6) top. The charges on these quarks are fractional as shown in Table 21.5.\n\nA proton is assumed to be made up of two up quarks and one down quark as shown in Fig. 21.18 (a). The neutron is assumed to be made of one up quarks and two down quarks as shown in Fig. 21.18 (b).\n\n## Leptons\n\nLeptons are particles that do not experience strong nuclear force. Electrons, muons, tau and their associated neutrinos are called leptons.\n\n## Guage boson\n\nThey are believed to be the exchange particles or carriers of basic forces of nature. For example, photons are the carriers of electromagnetic force, the gluons glue the quarks in the protons and neutrons and hold the nucleus together. The $\\mathrm{W}^{\\prime}$, $\\mathrm{W}^{\\prime}$ and Z bosons are the exchange particles of elctro weak force. Currently, the standard model does not explain the gravity or its associated particle graviton.\n\n## Higgs boson\n\nHiggs boson, discovered in July, 2012, provides an explanation for how the other particles get mass by interacting with it.\n\n# SUMMARY\n\n- The combined number of all the protons and neutrons in a nucleus is known as mass number and is denoted by $A$.\n- The protons and neutrons present in the nucleus are called nucleons.\n- The number of neutrons present in a nucleus is called its neutron number and is denoted by N .\n- The number of protons inside a nucleus or the number of electrons outside of the nucleus is called the atomic number or the charge number of an atom and is denoted by $Z$.\n- Isotopes are such nuclei of an element that have the same charge number $Z$, but have different mass number $A$.\n- The emission of radiations ( $\\alpha, \\beta$ and $\\gamma$ ) form elements having charge number $Z$ greater than 82 is called radioactivity.\n- The change of an element into a new element due to emission of radiations is called radioactive decay. The original element is called parent element and the element formed due to this decay is called daughter element\n- Half-life of a radioactive element is that period in which half of the atoms of the parent element decay into daughter element.\n- Such a reaction is which a heavy nucleus like uranium splits up into two nuclei of equal size along with the emission of energy during reaction is called fission reaction.\n- Such a nuclear reaction in which two light nuclei merge to form a heavy nucleus along with the emission of the energy is called fusion reaction.\n- The strength of the radiation source is indicated by its activity measured in becquerel. One becquerel (Bq) is one disintegration per second. A large unit is curie (Ci) which equals $3.7 \\times 10^{10}$ disintegrations per second.\n- The effect of radiation on a body absorbing it relates to a quantity called absorbed dose D defined as the energy E absorbed from ionizing radiation per unit mass $m$ of the absorbing body.\n- The basic forces are:\ni. Gravitational force ii. Electromagnetic force\niii. Weak nucleus force iv. The strong force\n- Subatomic particles are classified into four groups:\ni. Hadrons ii. Leptons\niii. Gauge boson iv. Higgs boson\n\nElementary particles are the basic building blocks of matter.\n\n# QUESTIONS\n\n21.1 What are isotopes?

          "title": "Complex Numbers\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nComplex numbers are an extension of the real numbers designed to solve equations that have no solutions within the realm of real numbers. The history of mathematics shows that man has been developing and enlarging his concept of number according to the saying that \"Necessity is the mother of invention\". In the remote past they started with the set of counting numbers and invented, by stages, the negative numbers, rational numbers, irrational numbers etc. Since square of a positive as well as negative number is a positive number, the square root of a negative number does not exist in the realm of real numbers. Therefore, square roots of negative numbers were given no attention for centuries together. However, recently, properties of numbers involving square roots of negative numbers have also been discussed in detail and such numbers have been found useful and have been applied in many branches of pure, applied, financial and computational mathematics.\n\n### 1.1 Complex Numbers\n\nThe numbers of the form $z=a+i b$, where $a, b \\in R$ and $i=\\sqrt{-1}$, are called complex numbers. For example, $3+4 i, 2 \\frac{5}{7} i,-7-2 i$ etc. are complex numbers and the set of all complex numbers is denoted by $C$.\n\n### 1.1.1 Recognition of Real and Imaginary Parts\n\nLet us start with considering the following equation:\n\n$$\nx^{2}+1 \\Rightarrow x^{2}=-1 \\Rightarrow x= \\pm \\sqrt{-1}\n$$\n\n$\\sqrt{-1}$ does not belong to the set of real numbers. We, therefore, for convenience call it imaginary number and denote it by $i$ (read as iota).\n\n## Note\n\nEvery real number is a complex number with 0 as its imaginary part.\n\nIn the complex number $z=a+i b, a$ is called real part and $b$ is called imaginary part of the complex number. For convenient, real part is denoted by $\\operatorname{Re} z$ and imaginary part by $\\operatorname{Im} z$ of a complex number $z$. For example, if $z=3+4 i$, then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Re} z=3 \\text { and } \\operatorname{Im} z=4\n$$\n\nThe product of a non-zero real number and $i$ is also an imaginary number.\nFor example, $2 i,-3 i, \\sqrt{5} i,-\\frac{11}{2} i$ are all imaginary numbers.\n\nConjugate of Complex Numbers: Let $z=a+i b$ be a complex number, then $a-i b$ is called the complex conjugate of $a+i b$. It is denoted by $\\bar{z}$. Thus $5-4 i$ is complex conjugate of $5+4 i$ and $-2-3 i$ is complex conjugate of $-2+3 i$.\n\n# Note A real number is self-conjugate.\n\n### 1.1.2 Operations on Complex Numbers\n\nWith a view to develop algebra of complex numbers, we state a few definitions.\nThe symbols $a, b, c, d, k$, where used, represent real numbers.\n(i) Addition: $(a+i b)+(c+i d)=(a+c)+i(b+d)$\n(ii) $k(a+i b)=k a+i k b$\n(iii) Subtraction: $(a+i b)-(c+i d)=(a+i b)+[-(c+i d)]$\n\n$$\n=a+i b+(-c-i d)=(a-c)+i(b-d)\n$$\n\n(iv) Multiplication: $(a+i b)(c+i d)=a c+i a d+i b c+i^{2} b d=(a c-b d)+i(a d+b c)$\n\n### 1.1.3 Complex Numbers as Ordered Pairs of Real Numbers\n\nWe can define complex numbers also by using ordered pairs.\nLet $C$ be the set of ordered pairs belonging to $R \\times R$ which are subject to the following properties:\n(i) $(a, b)=(c, d) \\Leftrightarrow a=c \\wedge b=d$\n(ii) $(a, b)+(c, d)=(a+c, b+d)$\n(iii) $(a, b)(c, d)=(a c-b d, a d+b c)$\n(iv) If $k$ is any real number, then $k(a, b)=(k a, k b)$\n\nThen $C$ is called the set of complex numbers. It is easy to see that\n\n$$\n(a, b)-(c, d)=(a-c, b-d)\n$$\n\nProperties (i), (ii) and (iii) respectively define equality, sum and product of two complex numbers. Property (iv) defines the product of a real number and a complex number.\nExample 1 Find the sum, difference and product of the complex numbers $(8,9)$ and $(5,-6)$\nSolution $\\operatorname{Sum}=(8+5,9-6)=(13,3)$\nDifference $=(8-5,9-(-6))=(3,15)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Product } & =(8.5-9(-6), 8(-6)+9.5) \\\\\n& =(40+54,-48+45)=(94,-3)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# 1.1.4 Properties of the Fundamental Operations on Complex Numbers\n\nIt can be easily verified that the set $C$ satisfies all the field axioms i.e., it possesses the properties of real numbers.\nBy way of explanation of some points we observe as follows:\n(i) The additive identity in $C$ is $(0,0)$.\n(ii) Every complex number $(a, b)$ has the additive inverse $(-a,-b)$ i.e., $(a, b)+(-a,-b)=(0,0)$\n(iii) The multiplicative identity is $(1,0)$ i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(a, b) \\cdot(1,0) & =(\\alpha \\cdot 1-b \\cdot 0, b \\cdot 1+\\alpha \\cdot 0)=(a, b) \\\\\n& =(1,0) \\cdot(a, b)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(iv) Every non-zero complex number \\{i.e., number not equal to $(0,0)\\}$ has a multiplicative inverse. The multiplicative inverse of $(a, b)$ is\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{a}{a^{2}+b^{2}}, \\frac{-b}{a^{2}+b^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\n$\\because \\quad(a, b)\\left(\\frac{a}{a^{2}+b^{2}}, \\frac{-b}{a^{2}+b^{2}}\\right)=(1,0)$, the identity element\n\n$$\n=\\left(\\frac{a}{a^{2}+b^{2}}, \\frac{-b}{a^{2}+b^{2}}\\right)(a, b)\n$$\n\n(v) $(a, b)[(c, d) \\pm(e, f)]=(a, b)\\left(c, d\\right) \\pm(a, b)(e, f)$\n\nExample 2 If $z_{1}=(4,2)$ and $z_{2}=(3,-1)$, then find $\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}$.\nSolution Given $z_{1}=(4,2), z_{2}=(3,-1)$\nNow, $\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}=\\frac{(4,2)}{(3,-1)}=\\frac{4+2 i}{3-i}$\nMultiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of $z_{2}=3-i$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}} & =\\frac{4+2 i}{3-i}=\\frac{4+2 i}{3-i} \\times \\frac{3+i}{3+i} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(4)(3)+(4)(i)+(2 i)(3)+(2 i)(i)}{(3)^{2}-(i)^{2}}=\\frac{12+4 i+6 i+2 i^{2}}{9-i^{2}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{12+10 i-2}{9-(-1)}=\\frac{10+10 i}{10}=1+i \\quad \\because \\quad i^{2}=-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, $\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}=1+i$\n\n# 1.1.5 Argand Diagram\n\nEvery complex number is represented by one and only one point of the coordinate plane and every point of the plane represents one and only one complex number. The components of the complex number are be the coordinates of the point representing it. In this representation the $x$-axis is called the real axis and the $y$-axis is called the imaginary axis. The coordinate plane itself is called the complex plane or $z$ - plane. The figure representing one or more complex numbers on the complex plane is called an Argand diagram. The Argand diagram is a way of representing one or more complex numbers on the complex plane. Points on the $x$-axis represent real numbers whereas the points on the $y$-axis represent imaginary numbers.\nIn an Argand diagram, the complex number $x+i y$ is uniquely represented by the order pair $(x, y)$. In Figure (i), the complex numbers $3+2 i,-2+2 i,-3-2 i$ and $2-2 i$ correspond to the order pairs $(3,2),(-2,2),(-3,-2)$ and $(2,-2)$ respectively have been represented geometrically by the point $A, B, C$ and $D$.\nModulus of a Complex Number: The real number $\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ is called the modulus of the complex number $x+i y$ and it is denoted by $|x+i y|$. In Figure (ii), $O A$ represents the modulus of $x+i y$. In other words, the modulus of a complex number is the distance from the origin to the point representing the number.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nz & =\\frac{(1+2 i)^{2}}{2-i}=\\frac{1+4 i+4 i^{2}}{2-i}=\\frac{-3+4 i}{2-i} \\times \\frac{2+i}{2+i}=\\frac{-6-3 i+8 i+4 i^{2}}{2^{2}-i^{2}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{-6+5 i-4}{4-(-1)}=\\frac{-10+5 i}{5} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad z & =-2+i\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTaking conjugate\n\n$$\n\\bar{z}=\\overline{-2+i}=-2-i\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text { and } & |\\bar{z}|=|-2-i|=\\sqrt{(-2)^{2}+(-1)^{2}}=\\sqrt{4+1} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & |\\bar{z}|=\\sqrt{5}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n# EXERCISE 1.1\n\n1. Find the multiplicative inverse of each of the following complex numbers:\n(i) $(-4,7)$\n(ii) $(\\sqrt{2},-\\sqrt{5})$\n(iii) $(1,0)$\n2. Separate into real and imaginary parts (write as a simple complex number):\n(i) $\\frac{2-7 i}{4+5 i}$\n(ii) $\\frac{(-2+3 i)^{2}}{1+i}$\n(iii) $\\frac{i}{1+i}$\n(iv) $\\frac{(4+3 i)^{2}}{4-3 i}$\n3. Prove that $\\bar{z}=z$ iff $z$ is real.\n4. For $z \\in C$, show that:\n(i) $\\frac{z+\\bar{z}}{2}=\\operatorname{Re}(z)$\n(ii) $\\frac{z-\\bar{z}}{2 i}=\\operatorname{Im}(z)$\n(iii) $|z|^{2}=z \\cdot \\bar{z}$\n5. If $z_{1}=2+i, z_{2}=3-2 i, z_{3}=1+3 i$, then express $\\frac{z_{1} z_{3}}{z_{2}}$ in the form of $a+i b$.\n6. If $z_{1}=2+7 i$ and $z_{2}=-5+3 i$, then evaluate the following:\n(i) $\\left|2 z_{1}-4 z_{2}\\right|$\n(ii) $\\left|3 z_{1}+2 z_{1}\\right|$\n(iii) $\\left|-7 z_{2}+2 z_{2}\\right|$\n(iv) $\\left|\\left(z_{1}+z_{2}\\right)^{3}\\right|$\n7. Show that: $i^{n+1}+i^{n+2} \\in i^{n+3}+i^{n+4}=0$, for all $n \\in N$.\n8. Find the least positive value of $n$, if $\\left(\\frac{1+i}{1-i}\\right)^{n}=1$\n9. Show that: the value of $i^{n}$ for $n \\in N$ and $n>4$ is $i^{r}$, where $r$ is the remainder when $n$ is divided by 4 .\n\n### 1.2 Equality of Two Complex Numbers\n\nThe two complex numbers $z_{1}=a+b i$ and $z_{2}=c+d i$ are said to be equal iff their real and imaginary parts are equal i.e., $a+b i=c+d i \\Leftrightarrow a=c$ and $b=d$.\nExample 4 If $(3+2 i)(x+i y)=5+12 i$, where $x, y \\in R$, then find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nSolution Given that\n\n$$\n(3+2 i)(x+i y)=5+12 i\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Rightarrow 3 x+3 i y+2 i x+2 i^{2} y=5+12 i \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow(3 x-2 y)+(2 x+3 y) i=5+12 i\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nComparing real and imaginary parts, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 3 x-2 y=5 \\\\\n& 2 x+3 y=12\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMultiply equation (i) by 3 and equation (ii) by 2 , we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 9 x-6 y=15 \\\\\n& 4 x+6 y=24\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAdd the equations\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n9 x-6 y+4 x+6 y & =15+24 \\\\\n13 x & =39 \\\\\nx & =3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstitute $x=3$ in equation (i), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3(3)-2 y & =5 \\\\\n9-2 y & =5 \\\\\n-2 y & =-4 \\\\\ny & =2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $x=3, y=2$\n\n# 1.2.1 Square Root of a Complex Number\n\nThe square root of a complex number is another complex number that, when squared, gives the original complex number.\nLet $w=p+i q$ is a square root of a complex number $z=x+i y$, where $p, q, x, y \\in R$, then $w=\\sqrt{z} \\ldots$ (i), taking square on both sides, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nw^{2} & =z \\\\\n(p+i q)^{2} & =x+i y \\\\\np^{2}+2 p q i-q^{2} & =x+i y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEquating real and imaginary parts, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x=p^{2}-q^{2} \\\\\n& y=2 p q\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe know that $\\left(p^{2}+q^{2}\\right)^{2}=\\left(p^{2}-q^{2}\\right)^{2}+4 p^{2} q^{2}$\nSubstitute $x=p^{2}-q^{2}, y=2 p q$ in the above equation, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(p^{2}+q^{2}\\right)^{2} & =x^{2}+y^{2} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad p^{2}+q^{2} & =\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom equations (ii) and (iv), we have $x=p^{2}-q^{2}$ and $p^{2}+q^{2}=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$. Solving for the values $p$ and $q$, we have\n\n$$\np= \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}+x}{2}} \\text { and } q= \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}-x}{2}}\n$$\n\nFrom equation (iii): $y=2 p q$, we have\n\n- $y>0$, if $p$ and $q$ have the same sign\n- $y<0$, if $p$ and $q$ have opposite signs\n- $y=0$, if $p=0$ or $q=0$\n\nTherefore, the square root of the complex number $z=x+i y$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{z}=\\sqrt{x+i y}= \\pm\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}+x}{2}}+\\frac{i y}{|y|} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}-x}{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nor $\\sqrt{x}= \\pm\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{|z|+x}{2}}+\\frac{i y}{|y|} \\sqrt{\\frac{|z|-x}{2}}\\right) \\cdots(\\mathrm{v})$, where $|z|=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}} \\geq 0$ is modulus of $z$.\nEquation (v) is the required formula for square root of the complex number $x+i y$.\nExample 5 Find the square root of complex number $5+12 i$ and also represent the square root on an Argand diagram.\nSolution Let $x+y i=5+12 i$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Rightarrow \\quad x & =5 \\text { and } y=12>0 \\\\\n|z| & =|5+12 i|=\\sqrt{5^{2}+12^{2}}=13\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nApplying the square root formula for complex numbers, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sqrt{5+12 i} & = \\pm\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{13+5}{2}}+\\frac{12 i}{|12|} \\sqrt{\\frac{13-5}{2}}\\right) \\\\\n& = \\pm(\\sqrt{9}+i \\sqrt{4})= \\pm(3+2 i)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the square root of the complex number $5+12 i$ are $3+2 i$ and $-3-2 i$ as shown in above figure.\n\n# EXERCISE 1.2\n\n1. Find the real values of $x$ and $y$ in each of the following:\n(i) $x+i y+2-3 i=i(5-i)(3+4 i)$\n(ii) $(x+i y)(1-i)=(2-3 i)(-5+5 i)\\left(-i \\frac{3}{5}\\right)$\n(iii) $\\frac{x}{2+i}+\\frac{y}{3-i}=4+5 i$\n\n2.

Find the real values of $x$ and $y$ if $(5-2 i)(x+i y)+3=i(11-i)-4 i$\n11. Find the real values of $u$ and $v$ if $u=2$ $v=3$\n12. If $z_{1}=4+5 i$ and $z_{2}=\\alpha-2 i$, find the real values of $\\alpha$ such that $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(z_{1} z_{2}\\right)=20$.\n\n# 1.3 Complex Polynomials as a Product of Linear Factors\n\nA complex polynomial $P(z)$ is a polynomial function of the complex variable $z$ with complex coefficients. It is expressed in the general form as:\n\n$$\nP(z)=a_{n} z^{n}+a_{n-1} z^{n-1}+\\ldots+a_{1} z+a_{0}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{n}, a_{n-1}, \\ldots, a_{1}, a_{0}$ are complex numbers $\\left(a_{n} \\neq 0\\right)$, and $n \\geq 0$ is an integer representing the degree of the polynomial.\nFor examples $P_{1}(z)=(1-i) z+3 i, P_{2}(z)=(5-4 i) z^{2}+(2+i) z+(3-4 i)$ and $P_{3}(z)=(2-i) z^{3}+2 z^{2} i+(5+3 i)$ are the examples of linear, quadratic and cubic complex polynomials respectively. If $n=0$, then $P(z)$ becomes a constant polynomial. A fundamental property of complex polynomials is that they can always be factored into a product of linear factors.\nAccording to the Fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n \\geq 1$ has exactly $n$ roots in complex number system $C$.\n\nA corollary to this theorem states that any polynomial $P(z)$ of degree $n$ can be factored completely into a constant $a$ and $n$ linear factor over $C$ in the form\n\n$$\nP(z)=a\\left(z-z_{1}\\right)\\left(z-z_{2}\\right) \\ldots\\left(z-z_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $z_{1}, z_{2}, \\ldots, z_{n}$ are complex roots of the polynomial equation $P(z)=0$. Once we know the roots of a polynomial equation $P(z)=0$ we can apply equation (1) to factored the polynomial $P(z)$ into $n$ linear factors. Specifically, if $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are roots of the polynomial equation $P(z)=0$, then the equation must be $P(z)=\\left(z-z_{1}\\right)\\left(z-z_{2}\\right)$. For examples, the polynomial $P(x)=x^{2}+4$ consists of real coefficient has no real roots, so it cannot be factored into linear polynomials with real coefficients. However, if we considered the polynomial $P(z)=z^{2}+4$ as a complex polynomial, we can easily be factored into two linear factors as:\n\n$$\nz^{2}+4=(z+2 i)(z-2 i)\n$$\n\nwhere $2 i$ and $-2 i$ are the complex roots of $z^{2}+4=0$\nfif $P(z)$ is a polynomial function, the values of $z$ that satisfy $P(z)=0$ are called the zeros of the function $P(z)$ and roots of the polynomial equation $P(z)=0$.\nExample 6 Factorize the polynomial $P(z)=z^{2}+(i-3) z-3 i$.\nSolution $P(z)=z^{2}+(i-3) z-3 i$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =z^{2}+z i-3 z-3 i \\\\\n& =z(z+i)-3(z+i) \\\\\n& =(z+i)(z-3)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 7 Factorize the polynomial $P(z)=z^{2}-4 i z+12$.\nSolution $P(z)=z^{2}-4 i z+12$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =z^{2}-4 i z-(-12) \\\\\n& =z^{2}-4 i z-i^{2} 12 \\quad \\because \\quad i^{2}=-1 \\\\\n& =z^{2}-6 i z+2 i z-i^{2} 12 \\\\\n& =z(z-6 i)+2 i(z-6 i) \\\\\n& =(z-6 i)(z+2 i)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 8 Factorize the polynomial $P(z)=z^{3}+(1+i) z^{2}+i z$.\nSolution $P(z)=z^{3}+(1+i) z^{2}+i z$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =z\\left[z^{2}+(1+i) z+i\\right] \\\\\n& =z\\left[z^{2}+z+i z+i\\right] \\\\\n& =z[z(z+1)+i(z+1)] \\\\\n& =z[(z+1)(z+i)] \\\\\n& =z(z+1)(z+i)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# Key concept\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem is a mathematical tool used to find all possible rational roots of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. According to rational root theorem:\nIf a polynomial $P(x)=a_{x} x^{x}+a_{x+} x^{x^{2}}+\\ldots+a_{1} x+a_{x}$ has integer coefficients, then every rational root $\\frac{p}{q}$ (in the simplest terms) satisfies:\n(i) $\\quad p$ is a factor of the constant term $a_{i y}$ (ii) $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient $a_{s y}$.\n\nExample 9 Factorize the polynomial $P(z)=z^{3}-3 z^{2}+z+5$.\nSolution According to rational root theorem the possible root of the equation are $\\pm 1$ and $\\pm 5$. On checking, we see that $z=-1$ is the root of $P(z)=0$ because\n\n$$\nP(-1)=(-1)^{3}-3(-1)^{2}+(-1)+5=0\n$$\n\nSo $z+1$ is a factor of the $P(z)$. Using synthetic division\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n-1 & 1 & -3 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n\\hline & -1 & -1 & 4 & -5 \\\\\n\\hline 1 & -4 & 5 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $z^{3}-3 z^{2}+z+5=(z+1)\\left(z^{2}-4 z+5\\right)$\nNext find the factors of $z^{3}-4 z+5$ using quadratic formula\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nz^{2}-4 z+5 & =0, \\text { here } a=1, b=-4, c-5 \\\\\nz & =\\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^{2}-4(1)(5)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-20}}{2}=\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2}=\\frac{4 \\pm 2 i}{2} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad z & =2 \\pm i\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe quadratic factors of $z^{2}-4 z+5=(z-(2+i))(z-(2-i))=(z-2-i)(z-2+i)$\nSubstituting in equation (i), we have the\n\n$$\nz^{3}-3 z^{2}+z+5=(z+1)(z-2-i)(z-2+i)\n$$\n\n### 1.3.1 Soiction of Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square\n\nAs we learned in previous classes, completing the square is a powerful and systematic method for solving quadratic equations. This technique involves rewriting a quadratic equation in the form $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$ into a perfect square trinomial, which can then be solved by taking the square root of both sides. This method is especially valuable when the quadratic equation does not factor easily. By completing the square, we can solve any quadratic equation, even those with irrational or complex roots, making it a more effective technique in algebra.\nExample 10 Solve the equation $2 z^{2}-12 z+50=0$ by completing square method and hence express it as a product of its linear factors.\n\nSolution $2 z^{2}-12 z+50=0$\nDividing both sides by 2\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nz^{2}-6 z+25 & =0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad z^{2}-2(3) z & =-25\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAdd $3^{2}$ on both sides\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nz^{2}-2(3) z+3^{2} & =-25+3^{2} \\\\\n(z-3)^{2} & =-16 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad z-3 & = \\pm \\sqrt{-16} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad z & =3 \\pm 4 i\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $z=3+4$ ior $z=3-4$ iare the required complex roots.\nUsing the corollary of Fundamental theorem of Algebra the equation can be factorized using the roots $3+4 i$ and $3-4 i$ as:\n$2 z^{2}-12 z+50=2\\left(z^{2}-6 z+25\\right)=2(z-(3+4 i))(z-(3-4 i))=2(z-3-4 i)(z-3+4 i)$\nHence, $2 z^{2}-12 z+50=2(z-3-4 i)(z-3+4 i)$\n\n# EXERCISE 1.3\n\n1.

Just as the Cartesian coordinate system uses an ordered pair $(x, y)$ to describe the position of a point, the polar coordinate system determines the position of a point using a directed distance $r$ from a fixed origin $O$ (called the pole) and an angle $\\theta$ that the line connecting the origin to the point makes with the polar axis (typically aligned\nwith the positive $x$-axis).\n\nIn polar coordinate system the location of a point $P$ can be described by polar coordinates in the form $(r, \\theta)$, where $r$ and $\\theta$ are real numbers.\nWhile $r$ is typically considered non-negative ( $r \\geq 0$ ), it is also possible for $r$ to be negative $(r<0)$. The value of $r$ changes depending on its sign, and this affects the position of the point in the plane.\nWhen $r>0$, the angle $\\theta$ is the measure of any angle in standard position whose terminal side lies along the line connecting the origin to the point $P$, measured from the polar axis (positive $x$-axis).\nFor example, the polar coordinates $\\left(5, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ represent a point 5 units away from pole at an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians.\nWhen $r<0$, the angle $\\theta$ is the measure of any angle in standard position whose terminal side lies along the line connecting the origin to the point $Q$, but the point $Q$ is located $|r|$ units in the opposite direction (i.e., $\\theta+\\pi$ ) from the polar axis (positive $x$-axis). For example, the polar coordinates $\\left(-5, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ represents a point 5 units away from the pole, but in the direction of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi=\\frac{5 \\pi}{4}$ radians.\n\n# Note $(-5, \\pi / 4)$ and $(5,5 \\pi / 4)$ represent the same point in the plane\n\n### 1.4.1 The Polar Form of a Complex Nurnber\n\nConsider the adjoining diagram representing the complex number $z=x+i y$. From the diagram, we see that $x=r \\cos \\theta$ and $y=r \\sin \\theta$, where $r=|z|$ is modulus and $\\theta$ is called an argument of $z$.\nHence $\\quad x+i y=r \\cos \\theta+i r \\sin \\theta$\nwhere $r=|z|=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ and $\\theta=\\tan ^{-1} \\frac{y}{x}$\nEquation (i) is called the polar form of the complex number $z$.\nExample 12 Express the complex number $1+i \\sqrt{3}$ in polar form.\nSolution Step - I: Put $r \\cos \\theta=1$ and $r \\sin \\theta=\\sqrt{3}$\nStep - II: $r^{2}=(1)^{2}+(\\sqrt{3})^{2}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Rightarrow r^{2}=1+3=4 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow r=2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nStep - III: $\\quad \\theta=\\tan ^{-1} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{1}=\\tan ^{-1} \\sqrt{3}=60^{\\circ}$\n\n## Note\n\n- If $x=0, y>0$ then $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$\n- If $x=0, y<0$ then $\\theta=-90^{\\circ}$\n- If $x=0, y=0$ then $\\theta$ is undefined.\n- If $y=0, x>0$ then $\\theta=0^{\\circ}$.\n- If $y=0, x<0$ then $\\theta=180^{\\circ}$.\n\nThus $1+i \\sqrt{3}=2 \\cos 60^{\\circ}+i 2 \\sin 60^{\\circ}$\nPrincipal Argument: The principal argument $\\theta$ of a complex number $z=a+b i$ is the angle between the positive real axis and the line joining $(a, b)$ to the origin in the Argand plane.\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Arg} z=\\theta=\\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) \\quad(a \\neq 0)\n$$\n\nIt is denoted by Arg.

Mathematically Ohm's Law can be expressed by the formula $V=I R$.\nWhen dealing with alternating current (AC) circuits, resistance generalizes to impedance ( $Z$ ). Resistance in a circuit is due to inductor $\\left(X_{L}\\right)$ and capacitor $\\left(X_{C}\\right)$. Their difference is reactance $X=\\left(X_{L}\\right)-\\left(X_{C}\\right)$. Geometrically it is shown in the adjacent figure.

          "title": "Functions and Graphs\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nFunctions are of fundamental importance in mathematics, describing relationships between inputs and outputs through a rule of correspondence. Understanding key concepts such as domain, co-domain and range is essential for analyzing different types of functions, including one-to-one, onto and bijective functions. Graphical representation helps in identifying intersecting points, such as where a linear function meets the coordinate axes, where two linear functions intersect or where a linear and a quadratic function cross. These intersections provide valuable insights into solving equations visually. Additionally, exploring square root and cube root function graphs allows for a deeper understanding of their unique properties and behaviour. This unit will enhance problem-solving skills by combining algebraic and graphical approaches to functions.\n\n### 2.1 Concept of Function\n\nThe term function was recognized by a German Mathematician Leibniz (1646-1716) to describe the dependence of one quantity on another. The following examples illustrate how this term is used:\n(i) The area $A$ of a square depends on one of its sides $x$ by the formula $A=x^{2}$, so we say that $A$ is a function of $x$.\n(ii) The volume \" $V$ \" of a sphere depends on its radius $r$ by the formula $V=\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^{3}$, so we say that $V$ is a function of $r$.\nA function is a rule of correspondence, relating two sets in such a way that each element in the first set corresponds to one and only one element in the second set.\nThus in, (i) above, a square of a given side has only one area and in, (ii) above, a sphere of a given radius has only one volume.\nNow we have a formal definition:\n\n### 2.1.1 Definition (Function, Domain, Codomain, Range)\n\nA function $f$ from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ is a rule of a correspondence that assigns to each element $x$ in $X$ a unique element $y$ in $Y$. The set $X$ is called the domain of $f$.\nThe set of corresponding elements $y$ in $Y$ is called the range of $f$. While the codomain of a function is the set $Y$ in which function's output values (range) lie.\nUnless stated to the contrary, we shall assume hereafter that the set $X$ and $Y$ consist of real numbers.\n\nNote Co-domain is the set of all possible outputs but the range is the actual set of outputs produced by the function under the given domain that is range set is always a subset of co-domain.\n\n# 2.1.2 Notation and Value of a Function\n\nIf a variable $y$ depends on a variable $x$ in such a way that each value of $x$ determines exactly one value of $y$, then we say that \" $y$ is a function of $x$ \".\nSwiss mathematician Euler (1707 - 1783) invented a symbolic way to write the statement \" $y$ is a function of $x$ \" as $y=f(x)$, which is read as \" $y$ is equal to $f$ of $x$ \".\nA function can be thought as a computing machine $f$ that takes an input $x$, operates on it in some way and produces exactly one output $f(x)$. This output $f(x)$ is called the value of $f$ at $x$ or image of $x$ under $f$.\nThe output $f(x)$ is denoted by a single letter, say $y$ and we write $y=f(x)$.\nThe variable $x$ is called the independent variable of $f$ and the variable $y$ is called the dependent variable of $f$. For now onward we shall only consider the function in which the variables are real numbers and we say that $f$ is a real valued function of real numbers.\nExample 1 Given $f(x)=x^{3}-2 x^{2}+4 x-1$, find:\n(i) $f(0)$\n(ii) $f(1)$\n(iii) $f(-2)$\n(iv) $f(1+x)$\n(v) $f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right), x \\neq 0$\n\nSolution $f(x)=x^{3}-2 x^{2}+4 x-1$\n(i) $f(0)=0-0+0-1=-1$\n(ii) $f(1)=(1)^{3}-2(1)^{2}+4(1)-1=1-2+4-1=2$\n(iii) $f(-2)=(-2)^{3}-2(-2)^{2}+4(-2)-1=-8-8-8-1=-25$\n(iv) $f(1+x)=(1+x)^{3}-2(1+x)^{2}+4(1+x)-1$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =1+3 x+3 x^{2}+x^{3}-2-4 x-2 x^{2}+4+4 x-1 \\\\\n& =x^{3}+x^{2}+3 x+2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(v) $f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{3}-2\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{2}+4\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)-1=\\frac{1}{x^{2}}-\\frac{2}{x^{2}}+\\frac{4}{x}-1, x \\neq 0$\n\nExample 2 Find the domain and range of $f(x)=x^{2}$.\nSolution For every real number $x, f(x)=x^{2}$ is a non-negative real number. So, Domain $f=$ set of all real numbers ; Range $f=$ set of all non-negative real numbers.\n\nExample 3 Find the domain and range of $f(x)=\\frac{x}{x^{2}-4}$.\nSolution At $x=2$ and $x=-2, f(x)=\\frac{x}{x^{2}-4}$ is not defined. So,\nDomain $f=$ set of all real numbers except -2 and 2 or $R-\\{-2,2\\}$\nLet $y=\\frac{x}{x^{2}-4} \\Rightarrow y\\left(x^{2}-4\\right)=x \\Rightarrow x^{2} y-4 y=x$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^{2} y-x-4 y & =0 \\\\\nx & =\\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^{2}-4(y)(-4 y)}}{2 y} \\\\\nx & =\\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+16 y^{2}}}{2 y}, y \\neq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## Remember\n\nThere are two types of intervals known as open interval and closed interval. In an open interval $(a, b)$, the endpoints are not included. In a closed interval $[a, b]$, the endpoints are included.\n\nClearly $x$ is defined for all $y \\neq 0$\n\n$$\n\\text { For } y=0 \\text {, we have } 0=\\frac{x}{x^{2}-4} \\Rightarrow x=0\n$$\n\nThis is $f(0)=0$\nSo, range $f=$ set of all real numbers or $(-\\infty, \\infty)$\nExample 4 Find the domain and range of $f(x)=\\sqrt{x^{2}-9}$.\nSolution As square root of a negative number is not a real number, therefore $x^{2}-9 \\geq 0$\n(i)\n\nLet $x^{2}-9=0 \\Rightarrow x= \\pm 3$\nCritical points divide the number line into three regions:\nPut $x=-4$ in (i), $16-9 \\geq 0$ (True)\nPut $x=0$ in (i), $0-9 \\geq 0$ (False)\nPut $x=4$ in (i), $16-9 \\geq 0$ (True)\nSo, domain $f \\doteq(-\\infty,-3] \\cup[3, \\infty)$\nThe smallest value of $x^{2}-9$ is 0 (when $x= \\pm 3$ ).\n$\\Rightarrow y=\\sqrt{x^{2}-9}=\\sqrt{0}=0$\nAs $|x|$ increases beyond $3, x^{2}-9$ grows to $+\\infty$, so $y$ grows to $+\\infty$.\nSo, range $f=[0, \\infty)$\n\n# 2.1.3 Vertical Line Test\n\nThe vertical line test is a method used to determine whether a graph represents a function. A graph represents a function if and only if no vertical line intersects the graph more than once. If any vertical line passes through the graph more than once, it is not a function.\n\nExplanation is given in the following figure.\n# 2.1.4 Types of Function\n\n## (i) One-to-One (Injective) Function\n\nA function $f: x \\rightarrow y$ is one-to-one if different inputs produce different outputs, that is if $f\\left(x_{1}\\right)=f\\left(x_{2}\\right)$ implies $x_{1}=x_{2}$. This means that no two different elements of the domain map to the same element of the co-domain.\nFor example, $f(x)=5 x+7$ is one-to-one because if $5 x_{1}+7=5 x_{2}+7$ implies $x_{1}=x_{2}$.\n\n## (ii) Onto (Surjective) Function\n\nA function $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ is called onto (or surjective) function if every element in the co-domain $Y$ has at least one pre-image in the domain $X$. In other words, for every $y$ in $Y$, there exists an $x$ in $X$ such that $f(x)=y$.\nFor example, $f(x)=2 x+3$, where the domain and co-domain are both real numbers.\nHere $y=2 x+3 \\Rightarrow x=\\frac{y-3}{2}$. Here for each $y$ in $R$, there exists $\\frac{y-3}{2}$ in $R$ such that $f\\left(\\frac{y-3}{2}\\right)=y$. Hence $f$ is an onto function.\n\n## (iii) Bijective Function\n\nA function $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ is called bijective if it is both one-to-one and onto.\nPiecewise Function\nA piecewise function is a function that is defined by different expressions (or \"pieces\") over different intervals of its domain. Each piece applies to a specific part of the domain.\nFor example, $\\quad f(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}2 x+1 \\text { if } x<0 \\\\ x^{2}-1 \\text { if } x \\geq 0\\end{array}\\right.$\nFor $x<0$, the function behaves as $2 x+1$ and for $x \\geq 0$, it behaves as $x^{2}-1$\nExample 5 Show that the function $f(x)=x+1$, where the domain and co-domain are all real numbers, is bijective.\nSolution A function is bijective if it is both one-to-one and onto.\nA function is one-to-one if $f\\left(x_{1}\\right)=f\\left(x_{2}\\right) \\Rightarrow x_{1}=x_{2}$ for $f(x)=x+1$\nSuppose $f\\left(x_{1}\\right)=f\\left(x_{2}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad x_{1}+1=x_{2}+1 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad x_{1}=x_{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo, the given function is one-to-one.\nIt is also onto because for every real number $y$, there is a real number $x$ (specifically $x=y-1$ ) such that $f(y-1)=y-1+1=y$. Hence, $f(x)$ is bijective.\nExemple 6 Show that the function $f(x)=x^{2}-2$, where the domain and co-domain are all real numbers, is neither one-to-one nor onto.\nSolution As $f\\left(x_{1}\\right)=f\\left(x_{2}\\right) \\Rightarrow x_{1}^{2}-2=x_{2}^{2}-2 \\Rightarrow x_{1}^{2}=x_{2}^{2}$\nTaking square root, we get $x_{1}=x_{2}$ or $x_{1}=-x_{2}$\nThis does not imply that $x_{1}=x_{2}$, for example $x_{1}=2, x_{2}=-2 \\Rightarrow x_{1} \\neq x_{2}$ and $f(2)=2=f(-2)$.\nThus, $f$ is not one-to-one.\nAlso, the element -2 in the co-domain $R$ is the smallest value that $f(x)=x^{2}-2$ can attain, and it is only achieved when $x=0$. However, any number less than -2 (in co-domain $R$ ) is not the image of any real number $x$ in domain $R$. For example, $f(x)=-3 \\Rightarrow x^{2}-2=-3$ has no\nreal root. Hence, $f(x)$ is nether one-to-one nor onto.\n\n# EXERCISE 2.1\n\n1.

This point represents the solution to the equation of the given function.\n\n### 2.2.1 Intersection of a Linear Function and Coordinate Axes\n\nAs we know that linear function is a function in which the highest power of the variable is one. While the coordinate axes refers to $x$-axis and $y$-axis in the Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nExample 7 Find the points of intersection of a linear function $y=2 x+6$ and coordinate axes graphically.\nSolution Table of values of $y=2 x+6$ are given below:\n\n| $x$ | $y=2 x+6$ |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| -1 | 4 |\n| 0 | 6 |\n| 1 | 8 |\n\nHence, from the above graph, the points $(-3,0)$ and $(0,6)$ are the points of intersection of $y=2 x+6$ and coordinate axes.\n\n# 2.2.2 Intersection of Two Linear Functions\n\nThe point of intersection of two linear functions is the point where their graphs cross each other. This means the two functions have the same $x$ and $y$ values at that point.\nExample 8 Find the point of intersection of $y=3 x+2$ and $y=-x+6$ graphically.\nSolution Table of different values of $x$ and $y$ is given below:\n\n| $x$ | $y=3 x+2$ | $y=-x+6$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| -1 | -1 | 7 |\n| 0 | 2 | 6 |\n| 1 | 5 | 5 |\n\nBy plotting the above points, we see that $(1,5)$ is the point of intersection of both the straight lines as shown in figure.\n### 2.2.3 Intersection of a Linear Function and a Quadratic Function\n\nA line and a parabola can either intersect at two points, one point or not as intersect at all. If there are two solutions, the system has two points of intersection. A single solution indicates that there is only one intersection point, suggesting that the line may be tangent to the parabola. If no solution exists, it means the line and the\n\nparabola do not intersect.\nExample 9 Solve the linear function $y=-x+3$ and quadratic function $y=x^{2}-6 x+3$ graphically.\nSolution Clearly $(3,0)$ and $(0,3)$ are the $x$-intercept and $y$-intercept respectively of $y=-x+3$.\n\n$$\ny=x^{2}-6 x+3\n$$\n\nPut $x=0$ in (i), so $(0,3)$ is the $y$-intercept.\nPut $y=0$ in (i), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =x^{2}-6 x+3 \\\\\nx & =\\frac{-(-6) \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^{2}-4(1)(3)}}{2(1)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-12}}{2}=\\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{24}}{2} \\\\\n& =\\frac{6 \\pm 2 \\sqrt{6}}{2}=3 \\pm \\sqrt{6} \\\\\n& =3-\\sqrt{6}, 3+\\sqrt{6}=0.6,5.4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo $(0.6,0)$ and $(5.4,0)$ are the $x$-intercepts.\nNow we find vertex $(h, k)$ of the parabola\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h=-\\frac{b}{2 a}=-\\frac{-6}{2(1)}=3 \\\\\n& k=(3)^{2}-6(3)+3=-6\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo, the vertex is $(3,-6)$.\nHence $(0,3)$ and $(5,-2)$ are the solutions (points of intersection) of the given functions.\n\n# 2.3 Graph of the Square Root Function\n\nExample 10 Graph the square root function $y=2 \\sqrt{x}+1$\nSolution Clearly the domain of $y=2 \\sqrt{x}+1$ is $x \\geq 0$, as the square root of a negative number is not a real number. The range of $y=2 \\sqrt{x}+1$ is $y \\geq 1$,\nTable of values and the graph of the function are given below:\n\n| $\\boldsymbol{x}$ | $\\boldsymbol{y}=\\mathbf{2} \\sqrt{\\boldsymbol{x}}+\\mathbf{1}$ |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| 0 | 1 |\n| 1 | 3 |\n| 2 | 3.8 |\n| 3 | 4.5 |\n| 4 | 5 |\n| 5 | 5.5 |\n| 6 | 5.9 |\n| 7 | 6.3 |\n| 8 | 6.7 |\n| 9 | 7 |\n| 10 | 7.3 |\n\n### 2.4 Graph of the Cube Root Function\n\nExample 11 Graph the cube root function $y=\\sqrt[3]{x-1}$\nSolution Table of values and the graph of the function are given below:\n\n| $\\boldsymbol{x}$ | $\\boldsymbol{y}=\\sqrt[3]{\\boldsymbol{x}-1}$ |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| -5 | $-1.8$ |\n| -4 | $-1.7$ |\n| -3 | $-1.6$ |\n| -2 | $-1.4$ |\n| -1 | $-1.3$ |\n| 0 | -1 |\n| 1 | 0 |\n| 2 | 1 |\n| 3 | 1.3 |\n| 4 | 1.4 |\n| 5 | 1.6 |\n\n# 2.5 Real Life Applications\n\n## Growth and Decay in Finance (Predicting Long-Term Stock Prices)\n\nWhen something increases in quantity or size over time, it is called growth. For example, money in a bank account earning interest (it grows larger), a population of rabbits is increasing over months.\nWhen something decreases in quantity or size over time, it is called decay. For example, a radioactive substance is losing its strength over years, a cup of hot coffee is cooling down over time.\nExample 12 The value of a stock follows the exponential growth model $P(t)=P_{0} e^{r t}$, where $P_{0}$ is the initial stock price, $r$ is the growth rate per year and $t$ is the time in years. Suppose a stock is currently valued at Rs. 5,000 , and it is expected to grow at a rate of $5 \\%$ per year.\n(i) Find the value of the stock after 10 years.\n(ii) After how many years will the stock double in value?\n\nSolution (i) The formula for the exponential growth is:\n\n$$\nP(t)=P_{0} e^{r t}\n$$\n\nGiven $\\quad P_{0}=5000, r=0.05(5 \\%$ growth rate), and $t=10$ years.\n\n$$\nP(10)=5000 e^{0.05 \\times 10}=5000 e^{0.5}\n$$\n\nUsing $e^{0.5} \\approx 1.6487$\n\n$$\nP(10)=5000 \\times 1.6487=8244\n$$\n\nSo, the value of the stock after 10 years is approximately Rs. 8244\n(ii) We want to find $t$ when the stock doubles, i.e., when $P(t)=2 P_{0}$. Using the equation:\n\n$$\n2 P_{0}=P_{0} e^{r t}\n$$\n\nDividing both sides by $P_{0}$, we have $2=e^{r t}$\nTaking the natural logarithm on both sides: $\\ln 2=r t$\n\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad t=\\frac{\\ln 2}{r}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\frac{0.6931}{0.05} \\\\\n& =13.86\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo, the stock will double in value i.e., approximately 14 years.\n\nExample 13 The concentration of a pollutant in a lake, in parts per million (ppm), decays over time according to the function\n\n$$\nC(t)=\\frac{100}{\\sqrt{t+1}}\n$$\n\nwhere $t$ is the time in days since the pollutant was introduced.\n(i) What is the concentration of the pollutant after 4 days?\n(ii) After how many days will the concentration drop below 10 ppm ?\n\nSolution (i) The pollutant concentration function is $C(t)=\\frac{100}{\\sqrt{t+1}}$, where $t$ is the time in days.\nConcentration after 4 days:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nC(4) & =\\frac{100}{\\sqrt{4+1}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{100}{\\sqrt{5}} \\\\\n& \\approx 44.72 \\mathrm{ppm}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe concentration after 4 days is about 44.72 ppm .\n(ii) When will the concentration drop below 10 ppm ? Set $C(t)=10$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 10=\\frac{100}{\\sqrt{t+1}} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{t+1}=10 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad t+1=100 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad t=99\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAfter 99 days, the concentration will drop below 10 ppm .\n\n# EXERCISE 2.2\n\n1.

          "title": "Theory of Quadratic Functions\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThis unit explores methods to find the maximum and minimum values of quadratic functions using completing the square and graphical analysis. It also covers the inverse of quadratic functions, determining their domain and range. Additionally, students will learn to solve absolute value quadratic equations and inequalities, as well as equations of rational, radical and exponential forms that can be reduced to quadratic equations. Finally, the unit demonstrates the practical applications of quadratic equations and inequalities in solving real-world problems, providing a strong foundation for problemsolving and analysis.\n\n### 3.1 Quadratic Function\n\nA quadratic function is a polynomial function of degree two. It is typically expressed in the standard form:\n\n$$\nf(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c\n$$\n\nwhere $a, b$ and $c$ are real numbers, and $a \\neq 0$.\n\n### 3.1.1 Analyzing Quadratic Fyaction by Sketching\n\nAs we know shape of the graph of a quadratic function $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$ is a parabola. The parabola opens upward or downward, depending on the sign of the leading coefficient $a$, as shown in the given figure.\nThe tip of the parabola, labeled as $V$ in the diagrams above, is known as the vertex having coordinates $(h, k)$. The vertical line passing through the vertex serves as the axis of symmetry for the parabola. The vertex represents a turning point, where the graph changes direction.\n\n- If $a>0$, then the vertex is a minimum point.\n- If $a<0$, then the vertex is a maximum point.\n\nFor sketching the quadratic function, we need to find the $x$-intercept, $y$-intercept and the vertex. For analyzing the sketch of quadratic function, we find whether the vertex is a minimum or a maximum point and indicate the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing.\n\nExample 1 Sketch and analyze $y=-x^{2}-2 x+3$.\nSolution $y=-x^{2}-2 x+3$\nThe $y$-intercept is $y=-(0)^{2}-2(0)+3=3$\nThe $x$-intercepts are found by solving the equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n-x^{2}-2 x+3 & =0 \\text { or } x^{2}+2 x-3=0 \\\\\nx^{2}+3 x-x-3 & =0 \\\\\nx(x+3)-1(x+3) & =0 \\\\\n(x+3)(x-1) & =0 \\\\\nx+3=0, x-1 & =0 \\\\\nx & =-3, x=1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow, we find the vertex\n\n$$\nh=\\frac{-b}{2 a}=-\\frac{(-2)}{2(-1)}=-1\n$$\n\n$k=-(-1)^{2}-2(-1)+3=-1+2+3=4$\nSo, the vertex $(-1,4)$ is a maximum point. The function $y$ is increasing on $(-\\infty,-1)$ and decreasing on $(-1, \\infty)$.\n# 3.1.2 Finding Maximum and Minimum Values of Quadratic\n\n## Functions by Completing Square\n\nCompleting the square is a technique used to rewrite a quadratic function $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$ in the following vertex form:\n\n$$\nf(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k\n$$\n\nwhere vertex $=(h, k), h=-\\frac{b}{2 a}$ and $k=c-\\frac{b^{2}}{4 a}$\n\n- If $a>0$, the minimum value of $f(x)$ at $x=h$ is $k$.\n- If $a<0$, the maximum value of $f(x)$ at $x=h$ is $k$.\n\nExample 2 Find the maximum or minimum value of $f(x)=-2 x^{2}+4 x+3$ by completing square.\nSolution\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f(x)=-2\\left(x^{2}-2 x\\right)+3 \\\\\n& f(x)=-2\\left(x^{2}-2 x+1-1\\right)+3 \\\\\n& f(x)=-2\\left[(x-1)^{2}-1\\right]+3 \\\\\n& f(x)=-2(x-1)^{2}+2+3 \\\\\n& f(x)=-2(x-1)^{2}+5\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $a=-2<0$\nTherefore, the maximum value is 5 , which occurs when $x=1$.\nExample 3 Find the maximum or minimum value of $f(x)=x^{2}-2 x-3$.\nSolution Given that $f(x)=x^{2}-2 x-3$\nHere $a=1, b=-2, c=-3$\n\n$$\nh=-\\frac{b}{2 a}=-\\frac{(-2)}{2(1)}=1\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nk=c-\\frac{b^{2}}{4 a}=-3-\\frac{(-2)^{2}}{4(1)}=-4\n$$\n\nHere $a=1>0$\nTherefore, the minimum value of $f(x)$ at $x=1$ is -4 .\n\n# 3.2 Inverse of Quadratic Function\n\nQuadratic functions are typically not one-to-one over their entire domain. To find an inverse for a quadratic function, we must restrict its domain to a portion where it is one-to-one. Commonly, we restrict the domain to either $x \\geq h$ (where $h$ is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex) or $x \\leq h$.\nExample 4 Find the inverse of $f(x)=x^{2}+4 x+3, x \\geq-2$. Also find its domain and range.\nSolution $f(x)=x^{2}+4 x+3, \\quad x \\geq-2$\nLet\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny & =x^{2}+4 x+3 \\\\\nx & =y^{2}+4 y+3 \\\\\ny^{2}+4 y+3-x=0 & \\text { (Interchange } x \\text { and } y \\text { ) } \\\\\ny & =\\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{(4)^{2}-4(1)(3-x)}}{2(1)} \\\\\ny & =\\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-12+4 x}}{2} \\\\\ny & =\\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4+4 x}}{2} \\\\\ny & =\\frac{-4 \\pm 2 \\sqrt{1+x}}{2} \\\\\nf^{-1}(x) & =-2 \\pm \\sqrt{1+x}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$ )\nThe above inverse function has both a positive and a negative component. To determine which is the inverse, we find domain and range of the given function.\n\n$$\n\\text { Domain } f=[-2, \\infty)\n$$\n\nTo find range, we proceed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f(x)=x^{2}+4 x+3 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad f(x)=(x+2)^{2}-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, minimum value of $f(x)$ is -1 and hence\n\n$$\n\\text { Range } f=[-1, \\infty)\n$$\n\nDomain $f^{-1}=[-1, \\infty)$, Range $f^{-1}=[-2, \\infty)$\nNow, we substitute any value of $x$ that falls within the domain of $f^{-1}(x)$. We choose the value $x=0$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f^{-1}(0)=-2+\\sqrt{1+0}=-1 \\\\\n& f^{-1}(0)=-2-\\sqrt{1+0}=-3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe notice only -1 lies in the range of $f$. Therefore, we discard negative component.\nHence $f^{-1}(x)=-2+\\sqrt{1+x}$\n\n# 3.3 Absolute Value\n\nThe absolute value of $x$, is defined as\n\n$$\n|x|=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\nx & , x \\geq 0 \\\\\n-x, & x<0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\n### 3.3.1 Absolute Value Quadratic\n\n## Equations\n\nTo solve the absolute value quadratic equations, all answers must be substituted back into the original equation to verify whether they are valid or not. Sometimes, \"extraneous\" solutions may appear which are not valid and must be eliminated from the final answer.\nExample 5 Solve $\\left|x^{2}-4\\right|=5$\nSolution $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}x^{2}-4=5 \\\\ x^{2}-4= \\pm 5\\end{array}\\right.$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^{2}-4 & =5 \\text { or } x^{2}-4=-5 \\\\\nx^{2} & =9 \\text { or } x^{2}=-1 \\\\\nx & = \\pm 3 \\text { or } x= \\pm \\sqrt{-1}=\\text { imaginary }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCheck: For $x=3$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\text { For } \\quad x=-3 \\\\\n\\left|3^{2}-4\\right|=5 \\\\\n|5|=5 \\\\\n5=5\n\\end{array}\\left\\lvert\\, \\begin{array}{l}\n\\left(-3^{2}\\right)-4 \\mid=5 \\\\\n|5|=5 \\\\\n5=5\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nHence solution set $=\\{ \\pm 3\\}$\n\n# 3.3.2 Absolute Value Quadratic Inequalities\n\nAbsolute value quadratic inequalities are inequalities that involve a quadratic expression within absolute value bars. They are generally of the following forms:\n$\\left|a x^{2}+b x+c\\right|<d,\\left|a x^{2}+b x+c\\right|>d,\\left|a x^{2}+b x+c\\right| \\leq d,\\left|a x^{2}+b x+c\\right| \\geq d$\nExample 6 Solve $\\left|x^{2}-6 x-4\\right|<3$\nSolution $\\left|x^{2}-6 x-4\\right|<3$\n$-3<x^{2}-6 x-4<3$\n$-3<x^{2}-6 x-4$\nand $\\quad x^{2}-6 x-4<3$\n$x^{2}-6 x-4+3>0$\nand $\\quad x^{2}-6 x-4-3<0$\n$x^{2}-6 x-1>0$\n(i) , $x^{2}-6 x-7<0$\n(ii)\n\nHere we solve $x^{2}-6 x-1=0$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x=\\frac{-(-6) \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^{2}-4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} \\\\\n& x=\\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36+4}}{2} \\\\\n& x=\\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{40}}{2} \\\\\n& x=\\frac{6 \\pm 2 \\sqrt{10}}{2} \\\\\n& x=3 \\pm \\sqrt{10} \\\\\n& x=3-\\sqrt{10} \\quad 3+\\sqrt{10} \\\\\n& x=-0.16 \\quad 6.16\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence critical values divide the number line into three regions.\nTest $x=-1$ in (i), we have\n\n$$\n(-1)^{2}-6(-1)-1>0 \\Rightarrow+6>0 \\quad \\text { (True) }\n$$\n\nTest $x=0$ in (i), we have\n\n$$\n(0)^{2}-6(0)-1>0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad-1>0 \\quad \\text { (False) }\n$$\n\nTest $x=7$ in (i), we have\n\n$$\n(7)^{2}-6(7)-1>0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 6>0 \\quad \\text { (True) }\n$$\n\nSolution set is $(-\\infty, 3-\\sqrt{10}) \\cup(3+\\sqrt{10}, \\infty)$\n\nNow, we consider (ii) and solve\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^{2}-6 x-7 & =0 \\\\\nx^{2}+x-7 x-7 & =0 \\\\\nx(x+1)-7(x+1) & =0 \\\\\n(x+1)(x-7) & =0 \\\\\nx+1 & =0, \\quad x-7=0 \\\\\nx & =-1, \\quad x=7\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThese critical values divide the number line into three regions.\nSolution set is $(-1,7)$\nHence the solution set of the given absolute value quadratic inequality is\n\n$$\n\\{(-\\infty, 3-\\sqrt{10}) \\cup(3+\\sqrt{10}, \\infty)\\} \\cap(-1,7)=(-1,3-\\sqrt{10}) \\cup(3+\\sqrt{10}, 7)\n$$\n\n# EXERCISE 3.1\n\n1.

We shall discuss the solutions of the rational and radical equations.\n\n### 3.4.1 Rational Equations Reducible to the Quadratic Equation\n\nA rational equation is an equation containing one or more rational expressions, where rational expressions typically contain a variable in the denominator.\nExample 7 Solve $\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{2}{x+1}=1, x \\neq 0, x \\neq-1$\nSolution $\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{2}{x+1}=1$\nMultiplying both sides by $x(x+1)$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(x+1)+2 x & =x(x+1) \\\\\nx+1+2 x & =x^{2}+x \\\\\n3 x+1 & =x^{2}+x \\\\\nx^{2}+x-3 x-1 & =0 \\\\\nx^{2}-2 x-1 & =0 \\\\\nx & =\\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^{2}-4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4+4}}{2} \\\\\nx & =\\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{8}}{2} \\\\\n& =\\frac{2 \\pm 2 \\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\\\n& =1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, Solution Set $=\\{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}\\}$\n\n# 3.4.2 Radical Equations Reducible to the Quadratic Equation\n\nEquations involving radical expressions of the variable are called radical equations. To solve a radical equation, we first obtain an equation free from radicals. Every solution of radical equation is also a solution of the radical-free equation but the new equation has solutions that are not solutions of the original radical equation. Such extra solutions (roots) are called extraneous roots.\nExample 8 Solve $\\sqrt{x+8}+\\sqrt{x+3}=\\sqrt{12 x+13}$\nSolution $\\sqrt{x+8}+\\sqrt{x+3}=\\sqrt{12 x+13}$\nSquaring both sides, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx+8+x+3+2(\\sqrt{x+8})(\\sqrt{x+3}) & =12 x+13 \\\\\n2(\\sqrt{x+8})(\\sqrt{x+3}) & =10 x+2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad \\sqrt{(x+8)(x+3)} & =5 x+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSquaring again, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^{2}+11 x+24 & =25 x^{2}+10 x+1 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 24 x^{2}-x-23 & =0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad(24 x+23)(x-1) & =0 \\\\\nx & =-\\frac{23}{24} \\text { or } x=1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOn checking we find that $-\\frac{23}{24}$ is an extraneous root. Hence solution set $=\\{1\\}$\n\n### 3.5 Real World Problems of Quadratic Equations and Inequalities\n\nWe shall now proceed to solve the problems which, when expressed symbolically, lead to quadratic equations in one variables.\nIn order to solve such problems, we must:\n(i) Suppose the unknown quantities to be $x$ or $y$ etc.\n(ii) Translate the problem into symbols and form the equation or inequality satisfying the given conditions.\nThe method of solving the problems will be illustrated through the following examples:\n\nExample 9 The length of a room is 3 metres greater than its breadth. If the area of the room is 180 square metres, find length and the breadth of the room.\nSolution Let the breadth of room $=x$ metres\nand the length of room $=(x+3)$ metres\n$\\therefore \\quad$ Area of the room $=x(x+3)$ square metres\nBy the given condition, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(x+3) & =180 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad x^{2}+3 x-180 & =0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad(x+15)(x-12) & =0 \\\\\n\\therefore \\quad x=-15 \\text { or } x & =12\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs breadth cannot be negative so $x=-15$ is not admissible.\nWhen $x=12$, we get $x+3=12+3=15$\nHence breadth of the room $=12$ metres and length of the room $=15$ metres.\nExample 10 A company manufactures laptops and its weekly profit function (in thousands of dollars) is $P(x)=-x^{2}+2 x+3$, where $x$ is the number of laptops produced (in hundreds). Find the range of production levels where the company makes at least $\\$ 4,000$ profit.\nSolution Here $P(x) \\geq 4$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& -x^{2}+2 x+3 \\geq 4 \\\\\n& -x^{2}+2 x+3-4 \\geq 0 \\\\\n& -x^{2}+2 x-1 \\geq 0 \\\\\n& x^{2}-2 x+1 \\leq 0 \\\\\n& (x-1)^{2} \\leq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis only holds true when $(x-1)^{2}=0 \\Rightarrow x=1$\nThe company makes exactly $\\$ 4,000$ profit when 100 laptops are produced (since $x=1$ means 100 laptops). There is no production level where profit is more than $\\$ 4,000$.\n\n# EXERCISE 3.2\n\n1. Solve the following equations:\n(i) $\\frac{1}{3 x}+\\frac{4 x}{6}=1, x \\neq 0$\n(ii) $\\frac{x}{x+1}+\\frac{x+1}{x}=\\frac{5}{2} ; x \\neq-1,0$\n(iii) $\\frac{1}{x+1}+\\frac{2}{x+2}=\\frac{7}{x+5} ; x \\neq-1,-2,-5$\n\n(iv) $\\frac{a}{a x-1}+\\frac{b}{b x-1}=a+b ; x \\neq \\frac{1}{a}, \\frac{1}{b}$\n(v) $\\frac{x+1}{x-1}+\\frac{x-1}{x+1}=2, x \\neq 1, x \\neq-1$\n(vi) $3 x^{2}+15 x-2 \\sqrt{x^{2}+5 x+1}=2$\n(vii) $\\sqrt{2 x+8}+\\sqrt{x+5}=7$\n(viii) $\\sqrt{3 x+4}=2+\\sqrt{2 x-4}$\n(ix) $\\sqrt{x+7}+\\sqrt{x+2}=\\sqrt{6 x+13}$\n(x) $\\sqrt{x+5}-\\sqrt{x-3}=2$\n\n2 A farmer bought some sheep for Rs. 9000. If he had paid Rs. 100 less for each, he would have got 3 sheep more for the same money. How many sheep did he buy, when the rate in each case is uniform?\n3. A man sold his stock of eggs for Rs. 2400. If he had 2 dozen more, he would have got the same money by selling the whole for Rs. 0.50 per dozen cheaper. How many dozen eggs did he sell?\n4. A cyclist travelled 48 km at a uniform speed. If he had travelled $2 \\mathrm{~km} /$ hour slower, he would have taken 2 hours more to perform the journey. How long did he take to cover 48 km ?\n5.

The braking distance (in metres) of a car is modeled by:\n$d(s)=0.02 s^{2}+0.1 s$, where $s$ is the speed of car in $\\mathrm{km} / \\mathrm{h}$\nIf the maximum safe braking distance is 50 metres, find the range of speed where braking is safe.\n7. A rocket follows the height function $h(t)=-5 t^{2}+20 t+30$, where $h(t)$ is the height in metres and $t$ is the time in seconds.

          "title": "Matrices and Determinants\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThis unit introduces the fundamental concepts and operations of matrices, equipping students with the skills to perform matrix addition, subtraction and multiplication involving both real and complex entries. It explores the essential properties of determinants and provides techniques for evaluating the determinant of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix using cofactors and determinant properties. Students will learn to apply row operations to determine the inverse and rank of matrices, as well as distinguish between consistent and inconsistent systems of linear equations through practical examples. The unit further explores into solving systems of linear equations, both homogeneous and non-homogeneous, using advanced methods such as matrix inversion, Cramer's Rule and Gaussian elimination. Emphasis is placed on the realworld applications of matrices in diverse fields such as graphic design, cryptography, data encryption, geometric transformations and highlighting the importance and versatility of matrix algebra in solving complex, practical problems.\n\n### 4.1 Matrix\n\nWhile solving linear systems of equations, a new notation was introduced to reduce the amount of writing. For this new notation the word matrix was first used by the English mathematician James Sylvester (1814 - 1897). Arthur Cayley (1821 - 1895) developed the theory of matrices and used them in the linear transformations. Now-adays, matrices are used in high speed computers and also in other various disciplines. The concept of determinants was used by Chinese and Japanese mathematicians but the Japanese mathematician Seki Kowa (1642-1708) and the German Mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) are credited for the invention of determinants. G. Cramer (1704-1752) employed the determinants successfully for solving the systems of linear equations.\nA rectangular array of numbers enclosed by a pair of bracket is called a matrix such as:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n2 & -1 & 3 \\\\\n-5 & 4 & 7\n\\end{array}\\right] \\quad \\text { (i) } \\quad \\text { or } \\quad\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n2 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 6 \\\\\n4 & 1 & -1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\ncalled columns. The numbers used in rows or columns are said to be the entries or elements of the matrix.\nThe matrix in (i) has two rows and three columns while the matrix in (ii) has four rows and three columns. Note that the number of the elements of the matrix in (ii) is $4 \\times 3=12$. Now the general definition of a matrix is:\nGenerally, a bracketed rectangular array of $m \\cdot n$ elements $a_{i j}\\left(1,2,3, \\ldots, m\\right.$; $j=1,2,3, \\ldots, n$ ), arranged in $m$ rows and $n$ columns such as:\nis called an $m$ by $n$ matrix (written as $m \\times n$ matrix), where $m \\times n$ is called the order of the matrix in (iii). The matrices are usually represented by the capital letters such as $A, B, C, X, Y$, etc., and small letters such as $a, b, c, l, m, n$, or $a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, \\ldots$, etc., are used to indicate the entries of the matrices.\nLet the matrix in (iii) be denoted by $A$. The $i$ th row and the $j$ th column of $A$ are indicated in the following tabular representation of $A$.\nThe elements of the $i$ th row of $A$ are $a_{i 1} a_{i 2} a_{i 3} \\ldots a_{i j} \\ldots a_{i n}$ while the elements of the $j$ th column of $A$ are $a_{1 j} a_{2 j} a_{3 j} \\ldots a_{i j} \\ldots a_{m j}$. We note that $a_{i j}$ is the element of the $i$ th row and $j$ th column of $A$. The double subscripts are useful to name the elements of the matrices. For example, the element 7 is at $a_{23}$ position in the matrix $\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}2 & -1 & 3 \\\\ -5 & 4 & 7\\end{array}\\right]$. For convenience, we shall write the matrix $A$ as:\n\n$A=\\left[a_{i j}\\right]_{m \\times n}$ or $A=\\left[a_{i j}\\right]$, for $i=1,2,3, \\ldots, m ; j=1,2,3, \\ldots, n$, where $a_{i j}$ is the element of the $i$ th row and $j$ th column of $A$.\nThe elements (entries) of matrices need not always be numbers but in the study of matrices, we shall take the elements of the\n\n## Note\n\nThe matrix $A$ is called real matrix if all of its elements are real.\nmatrices from $R$ or $C$.\nRow Matrix or Row vector: A matrix, which has only one row, i.e., $1 \\times n$ matrix of the form $\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}a_{i 1} & a_{i 2} & a_{i 3} & \\ldots & a_{i n}\\end{array}\\right]$ is said to be a row matrix or a row vector.\nColumn Matrix or Column Vector: A matrix which has only one column i.e., an $m \\times 1$ matrix of the form $\\left[\\begin{array}{c}a_{1 j} \\\\ a_{2 j} \\\\ a_{3 j} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{m j}\\end{array}\\right]$ is said to be a column matrix or a column vector.\n\nFor example [1-1 3 4] is a row matrix having 4 columns and $\\left[\\begin{array}{l}2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]$ is a column matrix having 3 rows.\nRectangular Matrix: If $m \\neq n$, then the matrix is called a rectangular matrix of order $m \\times n$, that is, the matrix in which the number of rows is not equal to the number of columns, is said to be a rectangular matrix. For example;\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}2 & 3 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 4\\end{array}\\right]$ and $\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}2 & -3 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\ 3 & -1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2\\end{array}\\right]$ are rectangular matrices of orders $2 \\times 3$ and $4 \\times 3$ respectively.\nSquare Matrix: If $m=n$, then the matrix of order $m \\times n$ is said to be a square matrix of order $n$ or $m$. i.e., the matrix which has the same number of rows and columns is called a square matrix. For example: $[0],\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}2 & 5 \\\\ -1 & 6\\end{array}\\right]$ and $\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}1 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & -1 & 8 \\\\ 3 & 5 & 4\\end{array}\\right]$ are square matrices of orders 1,2 and 3 respectively.\n\nLet $A=\\left[a_{i j}\\right]$ be a square matrix of order $n$, then the entries $a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33}, \\ldots, a_{n n}$ form the principal diagonal for the matrix $A$ and the entries $a_{1 n}, a_{2 n-1}, a_{3 n-2}, \\ldots, a_{n-12}, a_{n 1}$ form the secondary diagonal for the matrix $A$. For example, in the matrix\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}\na_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} \\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24} \\\\\na_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{34} \\\\\na_{41} & a_{42} & a_{43} & a_{44}\n\\end{array}\\right], \\text { the entries of the principal diagonal are } a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33}, a_{44} \\text { and the }\n$$\n\nentries of the secondary diagonal are $a_{14}, a_{23}, a_{32}, a_{41}$.\nThe principal diagonal of a square matrix is also called the leading diagonal or main diagonal of the matrix.\nDiagonal Matrix: Let $A=\\left[a_{i j}\\right]$ be a square matrix of order $n$.\nIf $a_{i j}=0$ for all $i \\neq j$ and at least one $a_{i j} \\neq 0$ for $i=j$, that is, some elements of the principal diagonal of $A$ may be zero but not all, then the matrix $A$ is called a diagonal matrix. The matrices\n\n$$\n[7],\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 5\n\\end{array}\\right] \\text { and }\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 4\n\\end{array}\\right] \\text { are diagonal matrices. }\n$$\n\nScalar Matrix: Let $A=\\left[a_{i j}\\right]$ be a square matrix of order $n$.\nIf $a_{i j}=0$ for all $i \\neq j$ and $a_{i j}=k$ (some non-zero scalar) for all $i=j$, then the matrix $A$ is called a scalar matrix of order $n$. For example:\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}7 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 7\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & a & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & a\\end{array}\\right](a \\neq 0)$ and $\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 3\\end{array}\\right]$ are scalar matrices of order 2,3 and 4 respectively.\nUnit Matrix or Identity Matrix: Let $A=\\left[a_{i j}\\right]$ be a square matrix of order $n$. If $a_{i j}=0$ for all $i \\neq j$ and $a_{i j}=1$ for all $i=j$, then the matrix $A$ is called a unit matrix or identity matrix of order $n$. We denote such a matrix by $I_{n}$ or simply $I$ and it is of the form:\n\n$$\nI_{n}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n1 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe identity matrix of order 3 is denoted by $I_{3}$, that is, $I_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]$\nNull Matrix or Zero Matrix: A square or rectangular matrix whose each element is zero, is called a null or zero matrix. An $m \\times n$ matrix with all its elements equal to zero, is denoted by $O_{m \\times n}$. Null matrices may be of any order. Here are some examples:\n$[0],\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{l}0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right]$\nNote\n$O$ may be used to denote null matrix of any order if there is no confusion.\nare null matrices of order $1,1 \\times 3,2 \\times 3,2 \\times 2,3 \\times 1,3 \\times 4$ respectively.\nEqual Matrices: Two matrices of the same order are said to be equal if their corresponding entries are equal. For example, $A=\\left[a_{i j}\\right]_{m \\times n}$ and $B=\\left[b_{i j}\\right]_{m \\times n}$ are equal, i.e., $A=B$ iff $a_{i j}=b_{i j}$ for $i=1,2,3, \\ldots, m, j=1,2,3, \\ldots, n$. In other words, $A$ and $B$ represent the same matrix.\nTranspose of a Matrix: If $A$ is a matrix of order $m \\times n$ then an $n \\times m$ matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of $A$, is called the transpose of $A$. It is denoted by $A^{t}$.

For a square matrix $A,|A|=|A|$\nii. If in a square matrix $A$, two rows or two columns are interchanged, the determinant of the resulting matrix is $-|A|$.\niii. If a square matrix $A$ has two identical rows or two identical columns, then $|A|=0$.\niv. If all the entries of a row (or a column) of a square matrix $A$ are zero, then $|A|=0$.\nv. If the entries of a row (or a column) in a square matrix $A$ are multiplied by a number $k \\in R$, then the determinant of the resulting matrix is $k|A|$.\nvi. If each entry of a row (or a column) of a square matrix consists of two terms, then its determinant can be written as the sum of two determinants, i.e., if\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& B=\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}\na_{11}+b_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\\na_{21}+b_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\\na_{31}+b_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\n\\end{array}\\right], \\text { then } \\\\\n& |B|=\\left|\\begin{array}{lll}\na_{11}+b_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\\na_{21}+b_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}\n\\end{array}\\right|=\\left|\\begin{array}{lll}\na_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}\n\\end{array}\\right|+\\left|\\begin{array}{lll}\nb_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\\nb_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}\n\\end{array}\\right| \\\\\n& a_{31}+b_{31} \\quad a_{32} \\quad a_{33}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nvii. If any row (column) of a determinant is multiplied by a non-zero number $k$ and the result is added to the corresponding entries of another row (column), the value of the determinant does not change.\nviii. If a matrix is in triangular form, then the value of its determinant is the product of the entries on its main diagonal.\n\n## Note We shall define triangular matrices on page 61.\n\nExample 6 Without expansion, show that $\\left|\\begin{array}{lll}x & a+x & b+c \\\\ x & b+x & c+a \\\\ x & c+x & a+b\\end{array}\\right|$\nSolution Adding the entries of $C_{3}$ to the corresponding entries of $C_{2}$.\nL.H.S $=\\left|\\begin{array}{lll}x & a+b+c+x & b+c \\\\ x & a+b+c+x & c+a \\\\ x & a+b+c+x & a+b\\end{array}\\right|$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =x(a+b+c+x)\\left|\\begin{array}{lll}\n1 & 1 & b+c \\\\\n1 & 1 & c+a \\\\\n1 & 1 & a+b\n\\end{array}\\right| \\quad\\left(\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\text { by taking } x \\text { common from } C_{1} \\text { and } \\\\\n(a+b+c+x) \\text { common from } C_{2}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\\\\n& =x(a+b+c+x) \\cdot 0 \\quad\\left(\\because C_{1} \\text { and } C_{2} \\text { are identical }\\right) \\\\\n& =0=\\text { R.H.S }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# 4.5 Adjoint and Inverse of a Square Matrix\n\nLet $A=\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\\end{array}\\right]$, then the matrix of co-factors of $A=\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}A_{11} & A_{12} & A_{13} \\\\ A_{21} & A_{22} & A_{23} \\\\ A_{31} & A_{32} & A_{33}\\end{array}\\right]$,\nand adj $A=\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}A_{11} & A_{21} & A_{31} \\\\ A_{12} & A_{22} & A_{32} \\\\ A_{13} & A_{23} & A_{33}\\end{array}\\right]$\nInverse of a Square Matrix of Order $n \\geq 3$ : Let $A$ be a non singular $(|A| \\neq 0)$ square matrix of order $n$.

          "title": "Partial Fractions\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nWe have learnt in the previous classes how to add two or more rational fractions into a single rational fraction. For example,\n(i) $\\frac{1}{x-1}+\\frac{2}{x+2}=\\frac{3 x}{(x-1)(x+2)}$\nand\n(ii) $\\frac{2}{x+1}+\\frac{1}{(x+1)^{2}}+\\frac{3}{x-2}=\\frac{5 x^{2}+5 x-3}{(x+1)^{2}(x-2)}$\n\nIn this unit we shall learn how to reverse the order in (i) and (ii) that is to express a single rational fraction as a sum of two or more single rational fractions which are called Partial Fractions.\nExpressing a rational fraction as a sum of partial fractions is called Partial Fraction\nResolution. It is an extremely valuable tool in the study of calculus to decompose a complex rational fraction into a sum of simpler fractions.\nAn open sentence formed by using the sign of equality ' $=$ ' is called an equation. The equations can be divided into the following two kinds:\nConditional equation: It is an equation in which two algebraic expressions are equal for particular values of the variable e.g.,\n(a) $2 x=3$ is a conditional equation and it is true only if $x=\\frac{3}{2}$.\n(b) $x^{2}+x-6=0$ is a conditional equation and it is true for $x=2,-3$ only.\n\n## Note\n\nFor simplicity, a conditional equation is called an equation.\nIdentity: It is an equation which holds good for all values of the variable e.g.,\n(a) $(a+b) x=a x+b x$ is an identity and its two sides are equal for all values of $x$.\n(b) $(x+3)(x+4)=x^{2}+7 x+12$ is also an identity which is true for all values of $x$. For convenience, the symbol '\"=0\" shall be used both for equation and identity.\n\n# 5.1 Rational Fraction\n\nAn expression of the form $\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials in $x$ with real coefficients and $Q(x) \\neq 0$, is called a rational fraction. A rational fraction is of two types.\n\n### 5.1.1 Proper Rational Fraction\n\nA rational fraction $\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ is called a Proper Rational Fraction if the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$ in the numerator is less than the degree of the polynomial $Q(x)$ in the denominator. For example, $\\frac{3}{x+1}, \\frac{2 x-5}{x^{2}+4}$ and $\\frac{9 x^{2}}{x^{3}-1}$ are proper rational fractions or proper fractions.\n\n### 5.1.2 Improper Rational Fraction\n\nA rational fraction $\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ is called an Improper Rational Fraction if the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$ in the numerator is equal to or greater than the degree of the polynomial $Q(x)$ in the denominator.\n\nFor example, $\\frac{x}{2 x-3}, \\frac{(x-2)(x+1)}{(x-1)(x+4)}, \\frac{x^{2}-3}{3 x+1}$ and $\\frac{x^{3}-x^{2}+x+1}{x^{2}+5}$\nare improper rational fractions or improper fractions.\nAny improper rational fraction can be reduced by division to a mixed form, consisting of the sum of a polynomial and a proper rational fraction.\nFor example, $\\frac{3 x^{2}+1}{x-2}$ is an improper rational fraction.\nBy long division we obtain $\\frac{3 x^{2}+1}{x-2}=3 x+6+\\frac{13}{x-2}$, that is an improper rational fraction $\\frac{3 x^{2}+1}{x-2}$ has been reduced to the sum\nof a polynomial $3 x+6$ and a proper rational fraction $\\frac{13}{x-2}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{3 x+6}{x-2} / 3 x^{2}+1 \\\\\n\\pm 3 x^{2} \\mp 6 x \\\\\n\\hline 6 x+1 \\\\\n\\pm 6 x+12 \\\\\n\\hline 13\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nWhen a rational fraction is separated into partial fractions, the result is an identity; i.e., it is true for all values of the variable in the domain of the identity.\n\nThe evaluation of the coefficients of the partial fractions is based on the following theorem:\n\"If two polynomials are equal for all values of the variable, then the polynomials have same degree and the coefficients of like powers of the variable in both the polynomials must be equal\".\nFor example,\nIf $p x^{3}+q x^{3}-a x+b=2 x^{3}-3 x^{2}-4 x+5, \\forall x$ then $p=2, q=-3, a=4$ and $b=5$.\n\n# 5.1.3 Resolution of a Rational Fraction $\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ into Partial Freations\n\nFollowing are the main points of resolving a rational fraction $\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ into partial fractions:\n(i) The degree of $P(x)$ must be less than that of $Q(x)$.

          "title": "Sequences and Series\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nIn this unit, students will leam to analyze and solve problems involving arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic sequences and series, including their real-world applications. Students will identify various sequence types, compute finite and infinite sums, and utilize sigma notation. Additionally, they will explore practical scenarios such as motor vehicle leasing, investment planning, and financial calculations. This unit also emphasizes applying these concepts to diverse fields, including healtheare, finance, and traffic modeling. Finally, students will be able to solve both theoretical and reallife problems using sequences and series effectively.\nLet us observe the following pattern of numbers:\n(i) $5,11,17,23, \\ldots$\n(ii) $6,12,24,48, \\ldots$\n(iii) $4,2,0,-2,-4, \\ldots$\n(iv) $\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{4}{9}, \\frac{8}{27}, \\frac{16}{81}, \\ldots$\n\nIn example (i), every number (except 5) is formed by adding 6 to the previous numbers. Hence a specific pattern is followed in the arrangement of these numbers. Similarly, in example (ii), every number is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2. Similar cases are followed in example (iii) and (iv). When a set of numbers follows a pattern and there is a clear rule for finding next number in the pattern, then we have sequence as in above examples.\n\n### 6.1 Sequence\n\nA sequence is a function whose domain is the set $N$ of all natural numbers, whereas the range may be any subset of real numbers or complex numbers. The numbers in a sequence are called its terms. We denote the first term of a sequence as $a_{1}$, second term as $a_{2}$ and so on. The $n^{\\text {th }}$ term of a sequence is denoted by $a_{n}$, which may also be referred to as the general term of the sequence, and the terms immediately preceding it are called the $(n-1)^{\\text {st }}$ term, the $(n-2)^{\\text {nd }}$ term and so on.\n\n### 6.1.1 Finite and Infinite Sequences\n\n1. A sequence which consists of a finite number of terms is called a finite sequence. For example, $2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23$ is a finite sequence of 8 terms.\n2. A sequence which consists of an infinite number of terms is called an infinite sequence. For example, $3,10,17,24, \\ldots$ is an infinite sequence, or more generally as $3,10,17,24, \\ldots, 7 n-4, \\ldots$ to show how each term was generated.\n\nNote If a sequence is given, then we can find its $n^{\\text {th }}$ term and if the $n^{\\text {th }}$ term of a sequence is given then we can find the terms of the sequence.\nExample 1 Find the first four terms of the following sequences whose $n^{\\text {th }}$ terms are given:\n(i) $a_{n}=3 n+1$\n(ii) $a_{n}=3 n^{2}-3$\n\nSolution (i) $a_{n}=3 n+1$\nSubstituting $n=1,2,3$ and 4 we have\n\n$$\na_{1}=3(1)+1=3+1=4\n$$\n\nSimilarly, $\\quad a_{2}=3(2)+1=6+1=7$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{3}=3(3)+1=9+1=10 \\\\\n& a_{4}=3(4)+1=12+1=13\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first four terms of the sequence are $4,7,10,13$.\n(ii) $a_{n}=3 n^{2}-3$\n\nSubstituting $n=1,2,3$ and 4 we have\n\n$$\na_{1}=3(1)^{2}-3=0\n$$\n\nSimilarly, $\\quad a_{2}=3(2)^{2}-3=3(4)-3=12-3=9$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{3}=3(3)^{2}-3=3(9)-3=27-3=24 \\\\\n& a_{4}=3(4)^{2}-3=3(16)-3=48-3=45\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first four terms of the sequence are $0,9,24,45$.\nSequences of numbers are also called progressions. Depending on the pattern, the progressions are classified as follows:\n(i) Arithmetic progression\n(ii) Geometric progression\n(iii) Harmonic progression\n\n# EXERCISE 6.1\n\n1. Find the next four terms of each sequence.\n(i) $12,16,20, \\ldots$\n(ii) $3,1,-1, \\ldots$\n2.

The difference $a_{n}-a_{n-1}(n>1)$ i.e., the difference of two consecutive terms of an A.P., is called the common difference and is usually denoted by $d$.\nThus, an arithmetic progression is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained by adding fixed constant to the previous term. This fixed constant is called common difference of the arithmetic progression.\nFor example: Following sequences are in A.P.\n(i) $1,3,5,7, \\ldots$ (common difference is 2 )\n(ii) $54,51,48, \\ldots$ (common difference is -3 )\n\nAn arithmetic progression with $n$ terms can be written as:\n\n$$\na_{1}, a_{1}+d, a_{1}+2 d, \\ldots, a_{1}+(n-1) d\n$$\n\nThe $n^{\\text {th }}$ term of an arithmetic progression can be written as:\n\n$$\na_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1) d\n$$\n\n## Note\n\n(i) $1^{n}, 2^{\\text {nd }}, 3^{\\text {rd }}$ and $n^{\\text {th }}$ terms of an A.P. are denoted by $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}$ and $a_{n}$ respectively.\n(ii) $n^{\\text {th }}$ term from the end of an $A . P$. is $(m-n+1)^{\\text {th }}$ term where ' $m$ ' denotes the total number of terms of an A.P.\n(iii) Three numbers $a, b, c$ are in $A . P$. if and only if $2 b=a+c$.\n(iv) Any term (except first and last) in an A.P. is equal to half of the sum of two terms equidistant from it.\n(v) If the term $a_{1}$ is unknown or not given, the $n^{\\text {th }}$ term can be written as $a_{n}=a_{m}+(n-m) d, n \\geq m$. Note that the subscript of the given term and coefficient of $d$ sum to $n$.\nThe middle term of an A.P. depends upon the number of terms, for example\n(i) $1,3,5,7,9,11$ is an A.P. with $n=6$\n(ii) $1,3,5,7,9,11,13$ is an A.P. with $n=7$\n\ni.e., If the total number of terms of an A.P. is even, then there are two middle terms i.e., $\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)^{n}$ and $\\left(\\frac{n}{2}+1\\right)^{n}$ where $n$ represent the number of terms. In example (i) 5,7 are two middle terms.\nIf the total number of terms of an A.P. is odd, then there is only one middle term i.e., $\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)^{n}$ term. In example (ii) 7 is the only middle term.\n\n# 6.2.1 Selection of terms in A.P.\n\n(i) Three consecutive terms of an A.P. can be chosen as $a-d, a, a+d$ or $a, a+d$, or $a+2 d$\n(ii) Four consecutive term of an A.P. may be written like $a-3 d, a-d, a+d, a+3 d$ or $a, a+d, a+2 d, a+3 d$.\n(iii) Last four consecutive terms if $\\ell$ is the last term can be written as below:\n\n$$\n\\ell-3 d, \\ell-2 d, \\ell-d, \\ell\n$$\n\nIf each term of an A.P. is increased or decreased, multiplied or divided by same non-zero number, then the resulting sequence is also an A.P. that is, if $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots, a_{n}, \\ldots$ are in A.P. with common difference $d$ then\n(i) $a_{1} \\pm k, a_{2} \\pm k, \\ldots, a_{n} \\pm k, \\ldots$ are also in A.P. with common difference ' $d$ '.\n(ii) $k a_{1}, k a_{2}, \\ldots, k a_{n}, \\ldots$ are also in A.P. with common difference ' $k d$ '.\n(iii) $\\frac{a_{1}}{k}, \\frac{a_{2}}{k}, \\ldots, \\frac{a_{n}}{k}, \\ldots$ are also in A.P. with common difference $\\frac{d}{k}$.\n(iv) Term by term addition or subtraction of two A.Ps. is also an A.P. i.e., If $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots a_{n}, \\ldots$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, \\ldots b_{n}, \\ldots$ are in A.P., then $a_{1} \\pm b_{1}, a_{2} \\pm b_{2}$, $a_{2} \\pm b_{3}, \\ldots$ are also in A.P.\nExample 2 Find the general term and the eleventh term of the A.P. whose first term and the common difference are 2 and -3 respectively. Also write its first four terms.\nSolution\nHere, $a_{1}=2, d=-3$\nWe know that $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1) d$\nSo,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{n} & =2+(n-1)(-3)=2-3 n+3 \\\\\na_{n} & =5-3 n\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the general term of the A.P. is $5-3 n$\n\nPutting $n=11$ in (i), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{11} & =5-3(11) \\\\\n& =5-33=-28\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe can find $a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$ by putting $n=2,3,4$ in (i), that is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{2}=5-3(2)=-1 \\\\\n& a_{3}=5-3(3)=-4 \\\\\n& a_{4}=5-3(4)=-7\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, the first four terms of the sequence are: $2,-1,-4,-7$.\nExample 3 If the $5^{\\text {th }}$ term of an $A . P$. is 13 and $17^{\\text {th }}$ term is 49 , find $a_{n}$ and $a_{13}$.\nSolution Given that $a_{5}=13$ and $a_{17}=49$\nPutting $n=5$ in $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1) d$, we have $a_{5}=a_{1}+(5-1) d$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{5}=a_{1}+4 d \\\\\n& 13=a_{1}+4 d \\quad\\left(\\because a_{5}=13\\right) \\\\\n& \\text { Also } \\quad a_{17}=a_{1}+(17-1) d \\\\\n& 49=a_{1}+16 d \\quad\\left(\\because a_{1}+49\\right) \\\\\n& 49=\\left(a_{1}+4 d\\right)+12 d \\\\\n& 49=13+12 d \\quad \\text { by (i) } \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad 12 d=36 \\Rightarrow d=3 \\\\\n& \\text { From (i), } a_{1}=13-4 d=13-4(3)=13-12=1 \\\\\n& \\text { Thus } \\quad a_{n}=1+(n-1)(3)=3 n-2 \\text { and } \\\\\n& a_{13}=3(13)-2=39-2=37\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 4 Find the number of terms in the A.P. ; if $a_{1}=3, d=7$ and $a_{n}=59$\nSolution Using $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1) d$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 59=3+(n-1) \\times 7 \\quad\\left(\\because a_{n}=59, a_{1}=3 \\text { and } d=7\\right) \\\\\n& 56=(n-1) \\times 7 \\Rightarrow n-1=8 \\Rightarrow n=9\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the terms in the A.P. are 9.\nExample 5 If $a_{n-2}=3 n-11$ find the $n^{\\text {th }}$ term of the sequence.\nSolution Replacing $n$ by $n+2$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{n+2-2} & =3(n+2)-11 \\\\\na_{n} & =3 n+6-11 \\\\\na_{n} & =3 n-5\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# EXERCISE 6.2\n\n1.

The $n^{\\text {th }}$ term is $a_{n}$ and the previous term is $a_{n-1}$. So, $a_{n}=r\\left(a_{n-1}\\right)$. Thus, $r=\\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n-1}}$. That is, the common ratio can be found by dividing any term by its previous term.\n\n### 6.5.1 Rule for $n$th term of a G.P.\n\nEach term after the first term is an $r$ multiple of its preceding term. Thus, we have,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{2}=a_{1} r=a_{1} r^{2-1} \\\\\n& a_{3}=a_{2} r=\\left(a_{1} r\\right) r=a_{1} r^{2}=a_{1} r^{3-1} \\\\\n& a_{4}=a_{2} r=\\left(a_{1} r^{2}\\right) r=a_{1} r^{3}=a_{1} r^{4-1} \\\\\n& \\vdots \\\\\n& a_{n}=a_{1} r^{n-1} \\text { which is the general term of a G.P. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### 6.5.2 Properties of G.P.\n\n(i) If each term of a G.P. is multiplied or divided by the same non-zero number, then the resulting sequence is also a G.P. that is if $g_{1}, g_{2}, g_{3}, \\ldots, g_{n}, \\ldots$ are in G.P. and $k$ is a non-zero number, then\n(a) $k g_{1}, k g_{2}, k g_{3}, \\ldots, k g_{n}, \\ldots$ are also in G.P.\n(b) $\\frac{g_{1}}{k}, \\frac{g_{2}}{k}, \\frac{g_{3}}{k}, \\ldots, \\frac{g_{n}}{k}, \\ldots$ are also in G.P.\n(ii) The reciprocals of the term of a G.P. also form a G.P. that is if $a, b, c$ are in G.P., then $\\frac{1}{a}, \\frac{1}{b}, \\frac{1}{c}$ are also in G.P.\n\n(iii) If each term of a G.P. is raised to the same power, the resulting numbers also form a G.P. that is, if $a, b, c$ are in G.P., then $a^{n}, b^{n}, c^{n}$ are also in G.P.\n(iv) Three numbers $a, b, c$ are in G.P. if and only if $b^{2}=a c$.\n(v) If the set of positive numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots, a_{n}, \\ldots$ are in G.P., then $\\log a_{1}, \\log a_{2}$, $\\log a_{3}, \\ldots, \\log a_{n}, \\ldots$ are in A.P. and vice-versa.\n(vi) Term by term multiplication or division of two G.Ps. are again in G.P. i.e., if $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3} \\ldots, a_{n}$, and $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, \\ldots, b_{n}$, are in G.P. then $a_{1} b_{1}, a_{2} b_{2}, a_{3} b_{3}, \\ldots$, $a_{n} b_{n}$ and $\\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}, \\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}, \\frac{a_{3}}{b_{3}}, \\ldots, \\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$ are also in G.P.\nExample 12 Find the eighth term of a geometric sequence for which $a_{1}=-3$ and $r=-2$.\nSolution Here, $a_{1}=-3, r=-2, n=8$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{n}=a_{1} \\cdot r^{n-1} \\\\\n& a_{8}=(-3) \\cdot(-2)^{8-1} \\\\\n& a_{8}=(-3) \\cdot(-128) \\\\\n& a_{8}=384\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 13 Find the $n^{\\text {th }}$ term of the G.P., 3, 12, 48, ...\nSolution Here $a_{1}=3, r=4$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{n}=a_{1} \\cdot r^{n-1} \\\\\n& a_{n}=3 \\cdot 4^{n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 14 Find the tenth term of the G.P., for which $a_{4}=108$ and $r=3$.\nSolution Step - 1: Find $a_{1}$.\nHere, $n=4, r=3, a_{4}=108$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{n} & =a_{1} \\cdot r^{n-1} \\\\\na_{4} & =a_{1} \\cdot 3^{4-1} \\\\\n108 & =27 a_{1} \\\\\n4 & =a_{1} \\\\\na_{1} & =4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nStep - 2: Find $a_{10}$.\nHere, $n=10, a_{1}=4, r=3$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{n}=a_{1} \\cdot r^{n-1} \\\\\n& a_{10}=4 \\cdot 3^{10-1} \\\\\n& a_{10}=78,732\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 15 Find the $5^{\\text {th }}$ term of the G.P., 3, 6, 12, ....\nSolution Here $a_{1}=3, a_{2}=6$, therefore, $r=\\frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}=\\frac{6}{3}=2$.\n\nUsing $a_{n}=a_{1} r^{n-1}$ for $n=5$, we have\n\n$$\na_{5}=a_{1} r^{5-1}=3 \\cdot 2^{5-1}=3 \\cdot 2^{4}=48\n$$\n\nExample16 Find $a_{n}$ if $a_{6}=\\frac{8}{27}$ and $a_{7}=\\frac{-64}{729}$ of a G.P.\nSolution: To find $a_{n}$ we have to find $a_{1}$ and $r$.\n\nUsing $\\quad a_{n}=a_{1} r^{n-1}$\n\n$$\na_{4}=a_{1} r^{4-1}=a_{1} r^{3}, \\text { so } a_{1} r^{3}=\\frac{8}{27}\n$$\n\nand $\\quad a_{7}=a_{1} r^{7-1}=a_{1} r^{6}$, so $a_{1} r^{6}=\\frac{-64}{729}$\nThus, $\\quad \\frac{a_{1} r^{6}}{a_{1} r^{3}}=\\frac{\\frac{-64}{729}}{\\frac{8}{27}}=\\frac{-8}{27} \\quad$ or $\\quad r^{3}=\\left(\\frac{-2}{3}\\right)^{3}$\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad r=-\\frac{2}{3}$\n(taking only real value of $r$ )\nPut $r^{3}=-\\frac{8}{27}$ in (ii), to obtain $a_{1}$ that is,\n\n$$\na_{1}\\left(-\\frac{8}{27}\\right)=\\frac{8}{27} \\Rightarrow a_{1}=-1\n$$\n\nNow putting $a_{1}=-1$ and $r=\\frac{-2}{3}$ in (i), we get\n\n$$\na_{4}=(-1)\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{n-1}=(-1)(-1)^{n-1} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{n-1}=(-1)^{n}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{n-1}\n$$\n\n# EXERCISE 6.5\n\n1.

The sequence $1, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{7}$ is a harmonic sequence since their reciprocals $1,3,5,7$ are in A.P.\nRemember that the reciprocal of zero is not defined, so zero cannot be the term of a harmonic sequence.\n\nThe general form of the harmonic sequence is $\\frac{1}{a_{1}}, \\frac{1}{a_{1}+d}, \\frac{1}{a_{1}+2 d}, \\cdots, \\frac{1}{a_{1}+(n-1) d}$.\nExample 22 Find the $n^{\\text {th }}$ and $8^{\\text {th }}$ terms of H.P. : $\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{8}, \\cdots$\nSolution The reciprocals of the terms of the sequence,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{8}, \\cdots \\quad \\text { are } 2,5,8, \\cdots\n$$\n\nThe numbers $2,5,8, \\cdots$ are in A.P., so\n\n$$\na_{1}=2 \\text { and } d=5-2=3\n$$\n\nPutting these values in $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1) d$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{n} & =2+(n-1) 3 \\\\\n& =3 n-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the $n^{\\text {th }}$ term of the given sequence $=\\frac{1}{a_{n}}=\\frac{1}{3 n-1}$ and substituting $n=8$ in $\\frac{1}{3 n-1}$,\n\nwe get the $8^{\\text {th }}$ term of the given H.P. which is $\\frac{1}{3 \\times 8-1}=\\frac{1}{23}$.\nAlternatively, $a_{8}$ of the A.P. $=a_{1}+(8-\\mathrm{I}) d$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =2+7(3) \\\\\n& =23\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the $8^{\\text {th }}$ term of the given H.P. $=\\frac{1}{23}$\nExample 23 If the $4^{\\text {th }}$ and $7^{\\text {th }}$ terms of the H.P. are $\\frac{2}{13}$ and $\\frac{2}{25}$ respectively, find the sequence.\nSolution Since the $4^{\\text {th }}$ term of the H.P. $=\\frac{2}{13}$ and its $7^{\\text {th }}$ term $=\\frac{2}{25}$, therefore the $4^{\\text {th }}$ and $7^{\\text {th }}$ terms of the corresponding A.P. are $\\frac{13}{2}$ and $\\frac{25}{2}$ respectively.\nNow taking $a_{1}$, the first term and $d$, the common difference of the corresponding A.P., we have,\n\n$$\na_{1}+3 d=\\frac{13}{2}\n$$\n\nand $\\quad a_{1}+6 d=\\frac{25}{2}$\nSubtracting (i) from (ii), gives\n\n$$\n3 d=\\frac{25}{2}-\\frac{13}{2}=6 \\Rightarrow d=2\n$$\n\nFrom (i), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{1} & =\\frac{13}{2}-3 d \\\\\n& =\\frac{13}{2}-6 \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, $\\quad a_{2}$ of the A.P. $=a_{1}+d=\\frac{1}{2}+2=\\frac{5}{2}$\nand $\\quad a_{3}$ of the A.P. $=a_{1}+2 d=\\frac{1}{2}+2(2)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\frac{1}{2}+4 \\\\\n& =\\frac{9}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence the required H.P. is $\\frac{2}{1}, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{2}{9}, \\frac{2}{13}, \\ldots$\n\n# 6.9.1 Harmonic Mean (H.M.)\n\nA number $H$ is said to be the harmonic mean (H.M.) between two numbers $a$ and $b$ if $a, H, b$ are in H.P.\n\nLet $a, b$ be the two numbers and $H$ be their H.M. Then $\\frac{1}{a}, \\frac{1}{H}, \\frac{1}{b}$ are in A.P.\nTherefore, $\\quad \\frac{1}{H}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}}{2}=\\frac{b+a}{a b}=\\frac{a+b}{2 a b}$.\nand $\\quad H=\\frac{2 a b}{a+b}$\nFor example, H.M. between 3 and 7 is\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 \\times 3 \\times 7}{3+7}=\\frac{2 \\times 21}{10}=\\frac{21}{5}\n$$\n\n### 6.9.2 n Harmonic Means between two Numbers\n\n$H_{1}, H_{2}, H_{3}, \\cdots, H_{n}$ are called $n$ harmonic means (H.Ms.) between $a$ and $b$ if $a, H_{1}, H_{2}, H_{3}, \\cdots, H_{n}, b$ are in H.P. If we want to insert $n$ H.Ms., between $a$ and $b$, we first find $n$ A.Ms. $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ between $\\frac{1}{a}$ and $\\frac{1}{b}$, then take their reciprocals to get $n$ H.Ms. between $a$ and $b$, that is, $\\frac{1}{A_{1}}, \\frac{1}{A_{2}}, \\cdots, \\frac{1}{A_{n}}$ will be the required $n$ H.Ms. between $a$ and $b$.\nExample 24 Find three harmonic means between $\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{1}{17}$.\nSolution Let $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}$ be three A.Ms. between 5 and 17, that is,\n\n$$\n5, A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, 17 \\text { are in A.P. }\n$$\n\nUsing $\\quad a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1) d$, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n17 & =5+(5-1) d \\\\\n4 d & =12 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad d & =3\n\\end{aligned} \\quad\\left(\\because a_{2}=17 \\text { and } a_{1}=5\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, $\\quad A_{1}=5+3=8, A_{2}=5+2(3)=11$ and $A_{3}=5+3(3)=14$\nHence $\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{11}, \\frac{1}{14}$ are the required harmonic means.\n\n# EXERCISE 6.9\n\n1.

Represent the number of cars arriving over time as a sequence and predict the total number of cars after an hour.\nSolution The sequence of car arrivals is:\n\n$$\n4,8,12,16, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis is an $A: P$, with\n$a_{1}=4, d=4, n=\\frac{60}{5}=12, a_{12}=?$\nUsing the formula for arithmetic sequence\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{n} & =a_{1}+(n-1) d \\\\\na_{12} & =4+(12-1)(4) \\\\\n& =4+11(4) \\\\\n& =4+44=48\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, after one hour there will be 48 cars.\n\nSimple Interest on Loan (Arithmetic Sequence with Particular Term)\nExample 28 To buy furniture for a new apartment Tayyab borrowed Rs. 50,000 at $8 \\%$ simple interest for 11 years. How much interest will he pay?\nSolution Since $8 \\%$ is the yearly interest rate, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Interest after one year }=\\text { Rs. } 50,000 \\times \\frac{8}{100} \\times 1=\\text { Rs. } 4000 \\\\\n& \\text { Interest after two years }=\\text { Rs. } 50,000 \\times \\frac{8}{100} \\times 2=\\text { Rs. } 8000\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, we have the A.P.\n\n$$\n4000,8000,12000, \\ldots\n$$\n\nHere, $a_{1}=4000, a_{2}=8000, d=a_{2}-a_{1}=4000, n=11$\nUsing the formula\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{n} & =a_{1}+(n-1) d \\\\\na_{11} & =4000+(11-1)(4000) \\\\\n& =4000+10(4000) \\\\\n& =4000+40000 \\\\\n& =\\text { Rs. } 44000\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, Tayyab will pay a total interest of Rs. 44000 on borrowed amount of Rs 50,000 after 11 years.\nCompound Interest on Loan (Geometric Sequence with Particular Term)\nExample 29 Amna invests Rs. 200000 at $5 \\%$ interest compounded annually. What total amount will she get after 10 years?\nSolution Let the principal amount be $P$. Then,\nThe interest for the first year $=P \\times \\frac{5}{100}=P(0.05)$\nThe total amount after first year $=P+P(0.05)=P(1+0.05)$\nThe interest for the second year $=P(1+0.05) \\times 0.05$\nThe total amount after second year $=P(1+0.05)+P(1+0.05) \\times 0.05$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =P(1+0.05)(1+0.05) \\\\\n& =P(1+0.05)^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the total amount after third year $=P(1+0.05)^{3}$\nThus, we have sequence of amounts\n\n$$\nP(1.05), P(1.05)^{2}, P(1.05)^{3}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nwhich is clearly a G.P., with\n\n$$\na_{1}=P(1.05), r=1.05, n=10, a_{10}=?\n$$\n\nUsing the geometric sequence formula\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{n} & =a_{1} r^{n-1} \\\\\na_{10} & =a_{1} r^{10-1} \\\\\n& =P(1.05) \\times(1.05)^{9} \\\\\n& =(200000)(1.05)^{10} \\quad P=200000 \\\\\n& =(200000)(1.62889) \\\\\n& =325778.92\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the total amount Amna will get after 10 years will be Rs. 325778.92\nGrid Column Distribution (Arithmetic Series Sum of Terms)\nExample 30 A web designer is using a 12 -column grid system where each column increases in width by 10px from the previous one. The first column width is 50px wide. Find the total width occupied by all 12 columns.\nSolution This follows an arithmetic series with:\nFirst term $=a_{1}=50$, Common difference $=d=10$\nNumber of terms $=n=12$\nUsing the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_{n} & =\\frac{n}{2}\\left[2 a_{1}+(n-1) d\\right] \\\\\nS_{12} & =\\frac{12}{2}[2(50)+(12-1)(10)] \\\\\n& =6[100+110]=6[210] \\\\\n& =1260 p x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the total width of all 12 columns is 1260 px .\nExample 31 Motor Vehicle Leasing Using Arithmetic Sequence\nA company leases a motor vehicle with the following terms:\n\n- The first monthly payment is Rs. 15,000\n- Each subsequent payment increases by Rs. 500 due to inflation adjustments.\n- The lease term is 24 months.\n\nFind:\n(i) What is the payment in the $24^{\\text {th }}$ month?\n(ii) What is the total amount paid over 24 months?\n(iii) If the company can only afford to pay a total of Rs. 400,000 , can they complete the 24 -months lease?\n(iv) Find maximum months $n$ such that total, payment $S_{n} \\leq 400,000$.\n\n# Solution Given:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { First term }=a_{1} & =15000 \\\\\n\\text { Common difference } & =d=500 \\\\\n\\text { Number of terms } & =n=24\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(i) Payment in $24^{\\text {th }}$ month:\n\nUsing the formula\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{n} & =a_{1}+(n-1) d \\\\\na_{24} & =15000+(24-1)(500) \\\\\n& =15000+23 \\times 500 \\\\\n& =15000+11500=\\text { Rs. } 26500\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(ii) Total payment over 24 months using the formula\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_{n} & =\\frac{n}{2}\\left(a_{1}+a_{n}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{24}{2}(15000+26500)=12(41500)=\\text { Rs. } 498000\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(iii) Can the company afford the lease?

          "title": "Permutations and Combinations\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nIn our daily life, permutations and combinations play a vital role in counting total number of possibilities, as well as in arrangements and selections of objects. They are used in many fields of science. For example,\n\n- In probability theory, permutations and combinations are used to compute how many times an event can occur in various scenarios and to estimate the odds of winning a lottery.\n- In biology, these are used to find out the total numbers of possible DNA sequences.\n- In computer science, these are used to count the possible number of passwords of a given length by using some specific characters.\n- Moreover, these are the important parts of many encryption algorithms to ensure the privacy and integrity of a data set.\n\n### 7.1 Fundamental Principle of Counting\n\nDanish wants to prepare invitation cards of 5 different colours (red, blue, green, orange and yellow) by changing any of 3 shapes (circle, square and rectangle). How many cards can Danish make?\nThe problem is to count the total number of ways in which Danish can make cards. One way to find the solution is by making tree diagram. Let us discuss another scenario: Danish's father wants to buy a table and has asked his son to help him decide. He narrowed down his options for manufacturer, types of material (wood, plastic, glass and marble) and types of shape (circle, square and rectangle). Find the total number of table choices from the above options.\nAgain the problem is to count the total number of ways in which Danish's father can choose a table.\n\n$1^{\\text {st }}$ Way: By making tree diagram.\nFrom tree diagram, it is clearer there are 12 choices for Danish's father to buy a table with one type of material and one type of shape.\n$2^{\\text {nd }}$ Way: By multiplying, Danisth's father can find the total number of table choices to buy a table with one kind of material and shape.\nTotal number of table choices $=$ Total types of material $\\times$ Total types of shape\n\n$$\n=4 \\times 3=12 \\text { choices }\n$$\n\nThese examples show that when making a choice involving multiple stages or categories, we can find the total number of outcomes by multiplying the number of options at each stage.\n\n# Statement\n\nSuppose $A$ and $B$ are two events, the event $A$ occurs in $m$ different ways, and the event $B$ occurs in $n$ different ways then the total number of ways that the two events one after another can occur in $m \\times n$ ways.\n\n$$\n\\text { Total number of ways }=m n\n$$\n\nProof: Let $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\cdots, a_{m}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, \\cdots, b_{n}\\right\\}$. Let $P$ denotes the event that both events $A$ and $B$ occur together then $P=\\left\\{\\left(a_{i}, b_{j}\\right): a_{i} \\in A, b_{j} \\in B, 1 \\leq i \\leq m\\right.$, $1 \\leq j \\leq n\\}=A \\times B$. Hence the number of ways in which both events $A$ and $B$ can occur is the number of elements in $A \\times B$ which is $m n$.\nThis principle can be extended to three or more events. For instance, if event $A$ can occur in $m$ ways, event $B$ can occur in $n$ ways and event $C$ can occur in $k$ ways, the number of ways that three events can occur all together is the\n\n## Try yourself!\n\nIf three dice are rolled together, how many total numbers of ways occur?\n\nproduct $m \\cdot n \\cdot k$.\n\n## Factorial (I)\n\nSuppose there are four chairs to be occupied by four students and we are interested in counting all the possible ways the students can be seated.\nTo occupy the first chair there are 4 options.

Similarly, for the third and fourth chairs, there are 2 and 1 options respectively.\n\nIn this way, we have to perform four independent events with $4,3,2$, and 1 options respectively.\nBy the Fundamental Principle of Counting, the total number of ways to occupy all the chairs is $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1=24$\nSuch problems frequently occur in daily life, where we have to multiply the first $n$ natural numbers: $1,2,3, \\cdots, n$.\nWe call this product the factorial of $n$ and denote it by $n!$ or $\\mid n$, thus for a natural number $n$ :\n\n$$\nn!\\text { or } \\quad \\underline{n}=n(n-1)(n-2) \\cdots 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1\n$$\n\nFor some reason we also define $0!=1$.

So, the first place can be filled in $n$ ways. Since repetitions are not allowed, so after placing one object we are left with $(n-1)$ objects, thus the second place can be filled in $(n-1)$ ways. Similarly the third place can be filled in $(n-2)$ ways, and so on. This continues until the $r^{\\text {th }}$ place which can be filled in $n-(r-1)=n-r+1$ ways. Therefore, by the Fundamental Principle of Counting, $r$ places can be filled by $n$ different objects in $n(n-1)(n-2) \\cdots(n-r+1)$ ways.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n{ }^{n} P_{r} & =n(n-1)(n-2) \\ldots(n-r+1) \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \\ldots(n-r+1)(n-r)!}{(n-r)!} \\\\\n{ }^{n} P_{r} & =\\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 4 How many different 4-digit numbers can be formed out from the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6$, when no digit is repeated?\nSolution The total number of digits $=6$\nThe digits forming each number $=4$\nSo, the required number of 4-digit numbers is given by:\n\n$$\n{ }^{6} P_{4}=\\frac{6!}{(6-4)!}=\\frac{6!}{2!}=\\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{2.1}=6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3=360\n$$\n\nExample 5 In how many ways can a set of 4 different mathematics books, 3 different physics books and 2 different chemistry books be placed on a shelf with a space for 9 books, if:\n(a) all the books are kept without any restriction.\n\n(b) all the books of the same subject are kept together.\n(c) only the mathematics books are kept together.\n\n# Soiation\n\n(a) all the books are kept without any restriction.\nTotal number of books $=4+3+2=9$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& { }^{9} P_{2}=9!=9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\quad 91 \\text { ways } \\\\\n& =362880 \\text { ways }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(b) all the books of the same subject are kept together.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& { }^{4} P_{4} \\cdot{ }^{3} P_{3} \\cdot{ }^{2} P_{2} \\cdot{ }^{3} P_{3}=4!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 3! \\\\\n& =24 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 \\\\\n& =1728 \\text { ways }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(c) only the mathematics books are kept together.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& { }^{4} P_{4} \\cdot{ }^{6} P_{3}=4!\\cdot 6! \\\\\n& =24 \\cdot 720 \\\\\n& =17280 \\text { ways }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 6 In how many ways 5 people are to be seated on a bench if:\n(a) there are no restrictions\n(b) two people can sit next to each other\n(c) two people cannot sit next to each other.\n\n## Solution\n\n(a) when there is no restriction, then\n\n$$\n\\text { Number of ways }={ }^{5} P_{2}=5!=120\n$$\n\n(b) when two people can sit next to each other, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& ={ }^{4} P_{4} \\cdot{ }^{2} P_{2} \\\\\n& =4!\\cdot 2!=24 \\cdot 2 \\\\\n& =48 \\text { ways }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## C D E\n\n51 ways\n## Try yourself!\n\nIn how many ways 6 people are to seated on a table if 3 cannot sit next to each other?\n\n# EXERCISE 7.2\n\n1.

          "title": "Mathematical Inductions and Binomial Theorem\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nFrancesco Mourolico (1494-1575) devised the method of induction and applied this device first to prove that the sum of the first $n$ odd positive integers equals $n^{2}$. He presented many properties of integers and proved some of these properties using the method of mathematical induction. In theoretical computer science, it bears the pivotal role of developing the appropriate cognitive skills necessary for the effective design and implementation of algorithms, assessing for both their correctness and complexity. We are aware of the fact that even one exception or case to a mathematical formula is enough to prove it to be false. Such a case or exception which fails the mathematical formula or statement is called a counter example.\nThe validity of a formula or statement depending on a variable belonging to a certain set is established if it is true for each element of the set under consideration.\nFor example, we consider the statement $S(n)=n^{2}-n+41$ is a prime number for every natural number $n$. The values of the expression $n^{2}-n+41$ for some first natural numbers are given in the table as shown below:\n\n| $n$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $S(n)$ | 41 | 43 | 47 | 53 | 61 | 71 | 83 | 97 | 113 | 131 | 151 |\n\nFrom the table, it appears that the statement $S(n)$ has enough chance of being true. If we go on trying for the next natural numbers, we find $n=41$ as a counter example which fails the claim of the above statement. So we conclude that to derive a general formula without proof from some special cases is not a wise step. This example was discovered by Euler (1707-1783).\nNow we consider another example and try to formulate the result. Our task is to find the sum of the first $n$ odd natural numbers. We write first few sums to see the pattern of sums.\n\n| Unit 4 Mathematical Inductions and Binomial Theorem | $<141$ | Mathematics (1) |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $n$ (The number of terms) | Sum |  |\n| 1 | $1=1^{2}$ |  |\n| 2 | $1+3=4=2^{2}$ |  |\n| 3 | $1+3+5=9=3^{2}$ |  |\n| 4 | $1+3+5+7=16=4^{2}$ |  |\n| 5 | $1+3+5+7+9=25=5^{2}$ |  |\n| 6 | $1+3+5+7+9+11=36=6^{2}$ |  |\n\nThe sequence of sums is $(1)^{2},(2)^{2},(3)^{2},(4)^{2}, \\ldots$\nWe see that each sum is the square of the number of terms in the sum. So the following statement seems to be true.\nFor each natural number $n$,\n\n$$\n1+3+5+\\cdots+(2 n-1)=n^{2} \\ldots \\text { (i) } \\quad \\because \\quad n^{\\text {th }} \\text { term }=1+2(n-1)\n$$\n\nBut it is not possible to verify the statement (i) for each positive integer $n$, because it involves infinitely many calculations which never end.\nThe method of mathematical induction is used to avoid such situations. Usually it is used to prove the statements or formulae relating to the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots\\}$ but in some cases, it is also used to prove the statements relating to the set $\\{0,1,2,3, \\ldots\\}$.\nHypothesis: A hypothesis is an educated guess or proposed explanation for a statement based on limited evidence. It serves as a starting point for further investigation and can be tested through experiments and observations. In scientific research, a hypothesis is usually framed as a statement that can be tested and either supported or rejected by data.\nInduction of Hypothesis: It refers to the process of formulating a general statement or hypothesis based on specific examples or patterns observed in particular cases. This technique is often employed in mathematical reasoning to propose conjectures that can later be proven rigorously using deductive methods.\n\n# 8.1 Principle of Mathematical Induction\n\nThe principle of mathematical induction is stated as follows:\nIf a proposition or statement $S(n)$ for each positive integer $n$ is such that\n\n1. Base Case: $S(1)$ is true i.e., $S(n)$ is true for $n=1$.\n2. Induction of Hypothesis: $S(k+1)$ is true whenever $S(k)$ is true for any positive integer $k$.\n3. Conclusion: $S(n)$ is true for all positive integers.\n\nProcedure for Induction of Hypothesis\n\n- Substituting $n=1$, show that the statement is true for $n=1$.\n- Assuming that the statement is true for any positive integer $k$, then show that it is true for the next higher integer.\nFor the second condition, one of the following two methods can be used:\n$S(k+1)$ is proved using $S(k)$.\n$S(k+1)$ is established by performing algebraic operations on $S(k)$.\nExample 1 Use mathematical induction to prove that $3+6+9+\\ldots+3 n=\\frac{3 n(n+1)}{2}$ for every positive integer $n$.\nSolution Let $S(n)$ be the given statement, that is,\n\n$$\nS(n): 3+6+9+\\ldots+3 n=\\frac{3 n(n+1)}{2}\n$$\n\nBase Case: When $n=1, S(1): 3=\\frac{3(1)(1+1)}{2}=3$. Thus $S(1)$ is true i.e., The base case is satisfied.\nInduction of Hypothesis: Let us assume that $S(n)$ is true for any $n=k \\in N$, that is,\n\n$$\nS(k): 3+6+9+\\ldots+3 k \\approx \\frac{3 k(k+1)}{2}\n$$\n\nThe statement for $n=k+1$ becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3+6+9+\\ldots+3 k+3(k+1) & =\\frac{3(k+1)[(k+1)+1]}{2} \\\\\n& =\\frac{3(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAdding $3(k+1)$ on both the sides of (A) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3+6+9+\\ldots+3 k+3(k+1) & =\\frac{3 k(k+1)}{2}+3(k+1) \\\\\n& =3(k+1)\\left(\\frac{k}{2}+1\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{3(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $S(k+1)$ is true if $S(k)$ is true.\nConclusion: Since both the conditions are satisfied, therefore, $S(n)$ is true for each positive integer $n$.\n\nExample 2 Use mathematical induction to prove that for any positive integer $n$,\n\n$$\n1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}+\\ldots+n^{2}=\\frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}\n$$\n\nSolution Let $S(n)$ be the given statement,\n\n$$\nS(n): 1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}+\\ldots+n^{2}=\\frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}\n$$\n\nBase Case: If $n=1, S(1):(1)^{2}=\\frac{1(1+1)(2 \\times 1+1)}{6}=\\frac{1 \\times 2 \\times 3}{6}=1$, which is true. Thus $S(1)$ is true, i.e., The base case is satisfied.\nInduction of Hypothesis: Let us assume that $S(k)$ is true for any $k \\in N$, that is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS(k): 1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}+\\ldots+k^{2} & =\\frac{k(k+1)(2 k+1)}{6} \\\\\nS(k+1): 1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}+\\ldots+k^{2}+(k+1)^{2} & =\\frac{(k+1)(k+1+1)(2 k+1+1)}{6} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)(2 k+3)}{6}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAdding $(k+1)^{2}$ to both the sides of equation (4), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}+\\ldots+k^{2}+(k+1)^{2} & =\\frac{k(k+1)(2 k+1)}{6}+(k+1)^{2} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(k+1)[k(2 k+1)+6(k+1)]}{6} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(k+1)\\left(2 k^{2}+k+6 k+6\\right)}{6} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(k+1)\\left(2 k^{2}+7 k+6\\right)}{6} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)(2 k+3)}{6}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, formula holds for $k+1$.\nConclusion: Since both the conditions are satisfied, therefore, by mathematical induction, the given statement holds for all positive integers.\nExample 3 Show that $\\frac{n^{2}+2 n}{3}$ represents an integer $\\forall n \\in N$.\nSolution Let $S(n)=\\frac{n^{2}+2 n}{3} \\in Z \\forall n \\in N$\nBase Case: When $n=1, S(1)=\\frac{1^{2}+2(1)}{3}=\\frac{3}{3}=1 \\in Z$. The base case is satisfied.\n\nInduction of Hypothesis: Let us assume that $S(n)$ is true for any $n=k \\in N$, that is,\n\n$$\nS(k)=\\frac{k^{2}+2 k}{3} \\text { represents an integer. }\n$$\n\nNow we want to show that $S(k+1)$ is also an integer. For $n=k+1$, the statement becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS(k+1) & =\\frac{(k+1)^{3}+2(k+1)}{3} \\\\\n& =\\frac{k^{3}+3 k^{2}+3 k+1+2 k+2}{3}=\\frac{\\left(k^{3}+2 k\\right)+\\left(3 k^{3}+3 k+3\\right)}{3} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(k^{3}+2 k\\right)+3\\left(k^{2}+k+1\\right)}{3}=\\frac{k^{3}+2 k}{3}+\\left(k^{2}+k+1\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs $\\frac{k^{3}+2 k}{3}$ is an integer by assumption and we know that $\\left(k^{2}+k+1\\right)$ is an integer as $k \\in N .

It is often used in mathematics to justify conclusions about sequences, series, and other constructs that involve integer values.\nExample10 Faris starts a savings plan where he deposits 1,000 rupees into his bank account every month. Using mathematical induction, prove that the total amount saved after $n$ months is given by:\n\n$$\nS(n)=1000 \\times n \\text { rupees }\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is a positive integer representing the number of months.\nSolution Given statement $S(n)=1000 \\times n$\nBase Case: For $n=1$ : After the first month, Faris save 1000 rupees. Therefore, the total savings after one month is $1000 \\times 1=1000$ rupees. The base case $S(1)$ holds true.\nInduction of Hypothesis: Assume the statement is true for some positive integer $k$, i.e., after $k$ months, the total savings is $S(k)=1000 \\times k$ rupees.\nNow, prove that the statement holds for $k+1$ months: After $k+1$ months, you would save an additional Rs. 1000, so the total savings becomes: $S(k+1)=1000 \\times k+1000$ $=1000 \\times(k+1)$ rupees. Thus, if the statement holds for $k$, it also holds for $k+1$.\nJustification and Communication: Using mathematical induction, we prove that saving Rs. 1000 monthly for $n$ months totals $1000 \\times n$ rupees.\nThe base case $(n=1)$ holds, and assuming it's true for $k$ months, we show it for $k+1$. Thus, the statement is valid for all natural numbers $n$, making it reliable for real-life applications.\nExample 11 Ali starts a daily exercise routine where each day he increases the number of push-ups he does by 2 .

Total push-ups $(1)^{2}+9(1)=10$. The base case $S(1)$ holds true.\n\nInduction of Hypothesis: Assume the statement is true for some positive integer $k$, i.e., the total number of push-ups after k days is $S(k)=k^{2}+9 k$.\n\nNow, prove it for $k+1$ days: On the $(k+1)$ th day, you do $10+2 \\times k$ push-ups. The total after $k+1$ days becomes: $k^{2}+9 k+(10+2 k)=k^{2}+2 k+1+9 k+9$\n\n$$\n=(k+1)^{2}+9(k+1)\n$$\n\nThe formula holds for $S(k+1)$.\nConclusion: By mathematical induction, the total number of push-ups after $n$ days is\n\n$$\nn^{2}+9 n\n$$\n\nExample 12 Suppose you aim to lose weight by reducing your calories intake by 50 calories each week.

The base case $S(1)$ holds true.\nInduction of Hypothesis: Assume the statement is true for some positive integer $k$, i.e., after $k$ : weeks, your intake is $S(k): 2500-50 \\mathrm{k}$ calories.\n\nNow, prove it for $k+1$ weeks: After $\\mathrm{k}+1$ weeks, your intake will be:\n\n$$\n2500-50 k-50=2500-50(k+1) \\text { calories.

The construction of Pascal's triangle follows these rules:\n\n1. The first row (corresponding to $n=0$ ) consists of a single entry:1.\n2. Each subsequent row begins and ends with 1 .\n3. Every interior entry is the sum of the two entries directly above it from the previous row.\nMathematically, this is expressed by Pascal's Rule:\n\n$$\n\\text { Pascal's Rule: }\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}, \\quad \\text { for } 0<k<n\n$$\n\nThe entries in the $n^{\\text {th }}$ row of Pascal's Triangle correspond to the binomial coefficients $\\binom{n}{0},\\binom{n}{1}, \\ldots,\\binom{n}{n}$\nFor example, the binomial coefficients corresponding to $n=4$ are:\n\n$$\n\\binom{4}{0}=1,\\binom{4}{1}=4,\\binom{4}{2}=6,\\binom{4}{3}=4,\\binom{4}{4}=1\n$$\n\nExample 22 Expand $(x+y)^{4}$ using Pascal's triangle.\nSolution The binomial coefficients for the expansion of correspond to the entries in the $n=4$ row of Pascal's triangle: 14641\nThus, the binomial expansion using Pascal's triangle is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (x+y)^{4}=1 x^{4}+4 x^{3} y+6 x^{2} y^{2}+4 x y^{3}+1 y^{4} \\\\\n& (x+y)^{4}=x^{4}+4 x^{3} y+6 x^{2} y^{2}+4 x y^{3}+y^{4}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 23 Expand $(x-2)^{5}$ use the binomial theorem and using Pascal's triangle.\nSolution Expand using Binomial Theorem:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(x-2)^{5} & ={ }^{5} C_{0} x^{5}(-2)^{0}+{ }^{5} C_{1} x^{5-1}(-2)^{1}+{ }^{5} C_{2} x^{5-2}(-2)^{2}+{ }^{5} C_{3} x^{5-3}(-2)^{3} \\\\\n& =x^{5}-10 x^{4}+40 x^{3}-80 x^{2}+80 x-32\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe binomial coefficients for the expansion of correspond to the entries in the $n=5$ row of Pascal's triangle: 15101051\n$(a+b)^{5}={ }^{5} C_{0} a^{5} b^{0}+{ }^{5} C_{1} a^{4} b^{1}+{ }^{5} C_{2} a^{3} b^{2}+{ }^{5} C_{3} a^{2} . b^{3}+{ }^{5} C_{4} a^{1} b^{4}+{ }^{5} C_{5} a^{0} b^{5}$\nReplace binomial coefficient from Pascal triangle and $a=x, b=-2$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(x-2)^{5} & =x^{5}(-2)^{0}+5 x^{4}(-2)^{1}+10 x^{3}(-2)^{2}+10 x^{2}(-2)^{3}+5 x(-2)^{4}+(-2)^{5} \\\\\n& =x^{5}-10 x^{4}+40 x^{3}-80 x^{2}+80 x-32\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# 8.5 Applications of Binomial Theorem\n\n### 8.5.1 Finding Approximate Value Using Binomial Theorem\n\nApproximations: We have seen in the particular cases of the expansion of $(1+x)^{n}$ that the power of $x$ goes on increasing in each expansion. Since $|x|<1$, so\n\n$$\n|x|^{r}<|x| \\text { for } r=2,3,4, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis fact shows that terms in each expansion go on decreasing numerically if $|x|<1$. Thus, some initial terms of the binomial series are enough for determining the approximate values of binomial expansions having indices as negative integers or fractions.\nSummation of infinite series: The binomial series are conveniently used for summation of infinite series. The series (whose sum is required) is compared with\n\n$$\n1+n x+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2!} x^{2}+\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!} x^{3}+\\ldots\n$$\n\nto find out the values of $n$ and $x$.

This unit explores polynomial division to determine the quotient and remainder. The remainder theorem is introduced as a powerful tool for evaluating polynomials efficiently, while the factor theorem is applied to factorize cubic polynomials. These concepts extend beyond theoretical mathematics, finding practical applications in polynomial regression, signal processing and coding theory. By mastering these techniques, students will develop a deeper understanding of polynomials and their significance in solving real-world problems.\n\n### 9.1 Polynomial Function\n\nA polynomial in $x$ is an expression of the form\n\n$$\na_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+a_{n-2} x^{n-2}+\\ldots+a_{2} x^{2}+a_{1} x+a_{0}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is a non-negative integer and the coefficients $a_{n}, a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \\ldots, a_{1}$ and $a_{0}$ are real numbers. It can be considered as a polynomial function of $x$, the highest power of $x$ in a polynomial is called the degree of the polynomial. In the expression (i) if $a_{n} \\neq 0$ then it is a polynomial of degree $n$. The polynomials $x^{2}-2 x+3$, $3 x^{3}+2 x^{2}-5 x+4$ are of degree 2 and 3 respectively.\nExample 1 Divide the cubic polynomial $3 x^{3}-10 x^{2}+13 x-6$ by the linear polynomial $x-2$.

In other words $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$ if and only if $x=a$ is the root of the polynomial equation $f(x)=0$.\nProof: Suppose $q(x)$ is the quotient and $R$ is the remainder when the polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $x-a$, till no $x$-term exists in the remainder, then:\n\n$$\nf(x)=(x-a) q(x)+R\n$$\n\nSuppose $f(a)=0 \\Rightarrow R=0$\n\n$$\nf(x)=(x-a) q(x)\n$$\n\n$(x-a)$ is a factor of $f(x)$\nConversely, if $(x-a)$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then $f(x)=(x-a) q(x)$ for some polynomial $q(x)$\n\n$$\nf(a)=0\n$$\n\nwhich proves the theorem.\nExample 5 Show that $x-2$ is a factor of $f(x)=x^{3}-7 x+6$ without factorizing.\nSolution Here, $f(x)=x^{3}-7 x+6$ and $a=2$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(2) & =2^{3}-7(2)+6 \\\\\n& =8-14+6=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(By factor theorem)\nSo, $x-2$ is a factor of $f(x)$.\nNote To determine if a given linear polynomial $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, we need to check whether $f(a)=0$.\nExample 6 If $x+1$ and $x-2$ are factors of $x^{3}+p x^{2}+q x+2$. Find the values of $p$ and $q$.\nSolution Let $f(x)=x^{3}+p x^{2}+q x+2$\nSince, $x+1$ is a factor of $f(x)$.\nSo, $\\quad f(-1)=0 \\Rightarrow-1+p-q+2=0$\n\n$$\np-q=-1\n$$\n\nSimilarly, $x-2$ is also a factor of $f(x)$.\nSo, $\\quad f(2)=0$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 8+4 p+2 q+2=0 \\\\\n& 4 p+2 q=-10 \\\\\n& 2 p+q=-5\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy adding (i) and (ii), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p=-2 \\\\\n& \\text { Put } \\quad p=-2 \\text { in (i), we have } \\\\\n& q=p+1=-2+1=-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# 9.1.3 Synthetic Division\n\nThere is a nice shortcut method for long division of a polynomial $f(x)$ by a polynomial of the form $x-a$.

Using synthetic division, find the other two factors.\nSolution Let $f(x)=x^{8}-13 x^{3}+36$\n\n$$\n=x^{4}+0 x^{3}-13 x^{2}+0 x+36\n$$\n\nHere $x-a=x-2 \\Rightarrow a=2$ and $x-a=x+2=x-(-2) \\Rightarrow a=-2$\nBy synthetic Division:\n\n| 2 | 1 | 0 | -13 | 0 | 36 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  | 2 | 4 | -18 | -36 |\n| -2 | 1 | 2 | -9 | -18 | 0 |\n|  |  | -2 | 0 | 18 |  |\n|  | 1 | 0 | -9 | 0 |  |\n\n$\\therefore$ Quotient $=x^{2}+0 x-9=x^{3}-9=(x+3)(x-3)$\nTherefore, other two factors are $(x+3)$ and $(x-3)$.\n\n# EXERCISE 9.1\n\n1.

These applications highlight the significance of polynomial analysis beyond theoretical mathematics.\nRegression Analysis: It is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\nPolynomial Regression: It is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is modeled as an $n^{\\text {th }}$-degree polynomial. It is used when the data shows a curved (non-linear) relationship, but we still want to fit a smooth, continuous function. Factor theorem is useful for reducing polynomial regression degree and remainder theorem helps in evaluating polynomials at given points.\nExample 8 Consider a data set of monthly sales figures. A polynomial regression model $P(x)=x^{3}+x^{2}+2 x+1$ is fitted to this data. If the observed sales in the $3^{\\text {rd }}$ month are 40 units, find the percentage error.\n\n## Salation\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Error } & =\\text { Observed }- \\text { Predicted }=40-P(3) \\\\\n\\text { Now, } & \\\\\nP(3) & =3^{3}+3^{2}+2(3)+1 \\\\\n& =27+9+6+1 \\\\\n& =43 \\\\\n\\text { Error } & =40-43 \\\\\n& =-3 \\\\\n\\text { So, Percentage Error } & =\\left|\\frac{-3}{40}\\right| \\times 100 \\\\\n& =7.5 \\%\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 9 Suppose a polynomial regression model $P(x)=3 x^{3}-4 x^{2}+2 x-5$. If a data point at $x=-1$ is missing. What should be its predicted value?\nSolution By remainder theorem\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(-1) & =3(-1)^{3}-4(-1)^{2}+2(-1)-5 \\\\\n& =-3-4-2-5 \\\\\n& =-14\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo, the predicted value of given polynomial regression model at $x=-1$ is -14 .\nDigital Signal Processing (DSP): It is the used in computers or digital devices to analyze, change or improve signals like sound, images or sensor data. In the context of DSP, we often deal with systems represented by transfer functions in the z-domain, denoted as $\\mathrm{H}(\\mathrm{z})$. These transfer functions are rational functions, meaning they are ratios of two polynomials in $z$ i.e., $H(z)=\\frac{B(z)}{A(z)}$, where $B(z)$ represents the numerator polynomial (related to the system's zeros) and $A(z)$ represents the denominator polynomial (related to the system's poles).\nIn signal processing, finding the roots of the numerator polynomial $B(z)$ provides the zeros of the system. If $B\\left(z_{0}\\right)=0$, then $\\left(z-z_{0}\\right)$ is a factor of $B(z)$. If $\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1$, this corresponds to a frequency that the system blocks.\nSimilarly, finding the roots of the denominator polynomial $A(z)$ provides the poles of the system. If $A\\left(p_{0}\\right)=0$, then $\\left(z-p_{0}\\right)$ is a factor of $A(z)$. The locations of these poles in the complex $z$-plane are crucial for determining the stability of the system. For a stable system, all poles must lie inside the unit circle $\\left(\\left|p_{0}\\right|<1\\right)$.\nExample 10 A signal processing system has a transfer function with a denominator $A(z)=z^{2}-0.25$. Use factor theorem to find the poles of the system and determine if the system is stable.\nSolution The poles occur when $A(z)=0$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nz^{2}-0.25 & =0 \\\\\nz^{2}-(0.5)^{2} & =0 \\\\\n(z-0.5)(z+0.5) & =0 \\\\\nz-0.5 & =0 \\text { or } z+0.5=0 \\\\\nz & =0.5 \\\\\n\\text { or } z & =-0.5\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the system has poles at $z=0.5$ and $z=-0.5$. For stable system, all poles must lie inside the unit circle $(|z|<1)$. Here, $|0.5|=0.5<1$ and $|-0.5|=0.5<1$. Since both poles are inside the unit circle, the system is stable.\n\n# EXERCISE 9.2\n\n1. Consider a data set at monthly sales figures. A polynomial regression model $P(x)=x^{3}+2 x^{2}+x-3$ is fitted to this data. If the observed sales in the $5^{\\text {th }}$ month are 240 units, find the percentage error.\n2. A retailer company has developed a polynomial regression model to predict weekly product demand: $D(w)=w^{3}-2 w^{2}+5 w-4$, where $D(w)$ represents predicted demand(in units) and $w$ is the week number. Use the remainder theorem to predict demand for $3^{\\text {rd }}$ week. If the observe demand is 22 units, calculate the prediction error.\n3. A digital signal processing system has a transfer function with a numerator $B(z)=z^{2}-z-2$. Use the factor theorem to find the zeros of the system.\n4. A signal process system has a transfer function $H(z)=\\frac{z^{2}+3 z+2}{z^{2}-0.2 z+0.9}$. Find the zero(s) of the transfer function by using factor theorem.\n5. A signal process system has a transfer function $H(z)=\\frac{z^{2}-0.5 z-0.5}{z^{3}+1}$. Find the zero(s) of the transfer function by using factor theorem.\n6. A signal processing system has a transfer function with a denominator $A(z)=z^{2}-0.3 z-0.4$. Use factor theorem to find the poles of the system and determine if the system is stable.\n7. The denominator of signal processing system's transfer function equal to $A(z)=z^{2}+1.2 z+0.35$ Use factor theorem to determine the location of the corresponding poles and assess the stability of the system.",

We will begin by learning how to determine the domain and range of trigonometric functions to understand their behavior. Next, we will discuss even and odd functions, along with their periodicity, which explains their repeating patterns.\nStudents will then learn how to graph and analyze sine, cosine, and tangent functions, following this, we will focus on calculating the maximum and minimum values of sinusoidal functions and examining their unique properties such as amplitude, frequency, and phase shifts.\nFinally, students will apply these trigonometric concepts to solve practical problems in navigation, engineering, and physics, including calculating distances, optimizing solar panel angles, and analyzing forces in structures. Mastering these concepts will enable students to solve both theoretical and real-world problems using trigonometry.\nLet us first find domains and ranges of trigonometric functions before drawing their graphs.\n\n### 11.1 Domains and Ranges of Sine and Cosine Functions\n\nWe have already defined trigonometric functions $\\sin \\theta$, $\\cos \\theta, \\tan \\theta, \\csc \\theta, \\sec \\theta$ and $\\cot \\theta$. We know that if $P(x, y)$ is any point on unit circle with centre at the origin $O$ such that $m \\angle X O P=\\theta$ in standard position, then\n\n$$\n\\cos \\theta=x \\quad \\text { and } \\sin \\theta=y\n$$\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ for any real number $\\theta$ there is one and only one value of each $x$ and $y$ i.e., of each $\\cos \\theta$ and $\\sin \\theta$. Hence $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$ are the functions of $\\theta$ and their\nFigure 11.1\ndomain is $R$, the set of real numbers.\nSince $P(x, y)$ is a point on the unit circle with centre at the origin $O$, therefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n-1 \\leq x \\leq 1 & \\text { and } & -1 \\leq y \\leq 1 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad-1 \\leq \\cos \\theta \\leq 1 & \\text { and } & -1 \\leq \\sin \\theta \\leq 1\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThus, the range of sine and cosine functions is $[-1,1]$.\n\n# 11.1.1 Domains and Ranges of Tangent and Cotangent Functions\n\nFrom the Figure 11.1.\n(i) $\\tan \\theta=\\frac{y}{x}, x \\neq 0$\n$\\Rightarrow$ terminal side $\\overrightarrow{O P}$ should not coincide with $O Y$ or $O Y^{\\prime}$ (the $Y$-axis)\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad \\theta \\neq \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pm \\frac{3 \\pi}{2}, \\pm \\frac{5 \\pi}{2}, \\ldots$\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad \\theta \\neq(2 n+1) \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where $n \\in Z$\nDomain of tangent function $=R-\\{x \\mid x=(2 n+1) \\frac{\\pi}{2}, n \\in Z\\}$\nIf $y=\\frac{1}{2}, \\tan 0=\\frac{1}{2 x}$ as $x \\rightarrow 0, \\frac{1}{2 x} \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$ therefore the range of tangent function $=R=$ set of real numbers.\n(ii) From Figure 11.1\n\n$$\n\\cot \\theta=\\frac{x}{y}, y \\neq 0\n$$\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ terminal side $\\overrightarrow{O P}$ should not coincide with $O X$ or $O X^{\\prime}$ (the $X$-axis)\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad \\theta \\neq 0, \\pm \\pi, \\pm 2 \\pi, \\ldots$\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad \\theta \\neq n \\pi$, where $n \\in Z$\nDomain of cotangent function $=R-\\{x \\mid x=n \\pi, n \\in Z\\}$\nIf $x=\\frac{1}{2}, \\cot 0=\\frac{1}{2 y}$ as $y \\rightarrow 0, \\frac{1}{2 y} \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$ therefore range of cotangent function $=R=$ set of real numbers.\n\n### 11.1.2 Domain and Range of Secant Function\n\nFrom the Figure 11.1\n\n$$\n\\sec \\theta=\\frac{1}{x}, x \\neq 0\n$$\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ terminal side $\\overrightarrow{O P}$ should not coincide with $O Y$ or $O Y^{\\prime}$ (the $Y$-axis)\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad \\theta \\neq \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pm \\frac{3 \\pi}{2}, \\pm \\frac{5 \\pi}{2}, \\ldots$\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad \\theta \\neq(2 n+1) \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where $n \\in Z$\nDomain of secant function $=R-\\left\\{x \\mid x=(2 n+1) \\frac{\\pi}{2}, n \\in Z\\right\\}$\n\nAs $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ so, $\\frac{1}{x} \\geq 1, \\sec \\theta \\geq 1$ and $-1 \\leq x \\leq 0$ so, $\\frac{1}{x} \\leq-1, \\sec \\theta \\leq-1$\nAs $\\sec \\theta$ attains all real values except those between -1 and 1\nRange of secant function $=R-\\{x \\mid-1<x<1\\}$\n\n# 11.1.3 Domain and Range of Cosccant Function\n\nFrom the Figure 11.1\n\n$$\n\\csc \\theta=\\frac{1}{y}, y \\neq 0\n$$\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ terminal side $\\overrightarrow{O P}$ should not coincide with $O X$ or $O X^{\\prime}$ (the $X$-axis)\n$\\Rightarrow \\theta \\neq 0, \\pm \\pi, \\pm 2 \\pi, \\ldots$\n$\\Rightarrow \\theta \\neq n \\pi$, where $n \\in Z$\nDomain of cosccant function $=\\mathrm{R}-\\{x \\mid x=n \\pi, n \\in Z\\}$\nAs $\\csc \\theta$ attains all values except those between -1 and 1\nRange of cosecant function $=\\mathrm{R}-\\{x \\mid-1<x<1\\}$\nThe following table summarizes the domains and ranges of the trigonometric functions:\n\n| Function | Domain | Range |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| $y=\\sin x$ | $(-\\infty, \\infty)=R$ | $[-1,1]$ |\n| $y=\\cos x$ | $(-\\infty, \\infty)=R$ | $[-1,1]$ |\n| $y=\\tan x$ | $R=(-\\infty, \\infty), x \\neq(2 n+1) \\frac{\\pi}{2}, n \\in Z$ | $(-\\infty, \\infty)=R$ |\n| $y=\\cot x$ | $R=(-\\infty, \\infty), x \\neq n \\pi, n \\in Z$ | $(-\\infty, \\infty)=R$ |\n| $y=\\sec x$ | $(-\\infty, \\infty), x \\neq(2 n+1) \\frac{\\pi}{2}, n \\in Z$ | $(-\\infty,-1] \\cup[1, \\infty)$ |\n| $y=\\operatorname{cosec} x$ | $(-\\infty, \\infty), x \\neq n \\pi, n \\in Z$ | $(-\\infty,-1] \\cup[1, \\infty)$ |\n\n### 11.2 Even and Odd Functions\n\nA function $f$ is said to be even if $f(-x)=f(x)$, for every number $x$ in the domain of $f$.\nFor example: $f(x)=x^{2}$ is even function of $x$. Here\n\n$$\nf(-x)=(-x)^{2}=x^{2}=f(x)\n$$\n\n## Remember!\n\nThe graph of even function is always symmetric about $y$-axis\n\nA function $f$ is said to be odd if $f(-x)=-f(x)$, for every number $x$ in the domain of $f$.\nFor example: $f(x)=x^{3}$ is an odd function of $x$.\nHere $f(-x)=(-x)^{3}=-x^{3}=-f(x)$\nThe function $f(\\theta)=\\cos \\theta$ for all $\\theta \\in R$ is an even\nfunction (see figure 11.2).\nHere $f(-\\theta)=\\cos (-\\theta)=\\cos \\theta=f(\\theta)$.\nThus, $f(\\theta)=\\cos \\theta$ is an even function.\nSimilarly, the function $f(\\theta)=\\sin \\theta$ for all $\\theta \\in R$ is an odd function.\nHere $f(-\\theta)=\\sin (-\\theta)=-\\sin \\theta=-f(\\theta)$.\nThus, $f(\\theta)=\\sin \\theta$ is an odd function.\nNote In both the cases, for each $x$ in the domain of $f,-x$ must also be in the domain of $f$.\n\n# 11.3 Period of Trigonometric Functions\n\nAll the six trigonometric functions repeat their values for each increase or decrease of $2 \\pi$ in $\\theta$ therefore, the values of trigonometric functions for $\\theta$ and $\\theta \\pm 2 n \\pi$, where $\\theta \\in \\mathrm{R}$ and $n \\in Z$, are the same. This behaviour of trigonometric functions is called periodicity.\nPeriod of a trigonometric function is the smallest positive number which, when added to the original circular measure of the angle, gives the same value of the function. A function is periodic, if $f(\\theta+p)=f(\\theta)$, for all $\\theta$ in domain of function and the least positive value of $p$ is called the period of the function.\nNow, let us discover the periods of the trigonometric functions.\nTheorem 11.1: Sine is a periodic function and its period is $2 \\pi$.\nProof: Suppose $p$ is the period of sine function such that\n\n$$\n\\sin (\\theta+p)=\\sin \\theta \\text { for all } \\theta \\in R\n$$\n\nNow put $\\theta=0$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sin (0+p) & =\\sin 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad \\sin p & =0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad p & =0,+\\pi,+2 \\pi,+3 \\pi, \\ldots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(i) If $p=\\pi$, then from (A)\n\n$$\n\\sin (\\theta+\\pi)=\\sin \\theta \\quad(\\text { not true }) \\quad \\because \\sin (\\pi+\\theta)=-\\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nThus $\\pi$ is not the period of $\\sin \\theta$\n(ii) If $p=2 \\pi$, then from (A)\n\n$$\n\\sin (\\theta+2 \\pi)=\\sin \\theta, \\quad \\text { which is true } \\quad \\because \\sin (0+2 \\pi)=\\sin 0\n$$\n\nAs $2 \\pi$ is the smallest positive real number for which\n\n$$\n\\sin (\\theta+2 \\pi)=\\sin \\theta\n$$\n\n$2 \\pi$ is the period of $\\sin \\theta$.\nTheorem 11.2: Tangent is a periodic function and its period is $\\pi$.\nProof: Suppose $p$ is the period of tangent function such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\tan (\\theta+p)=\\tan \\theta \\quad \\text { for all } \\theta \\in \\mathrm{R} \\\\\n& p=0, \\pi, 2 \\pi, 3 \\pi, \\ldots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(i) If $p=\\pi$, then from (B) $\\tan (\\theta+\\pi)=\\tan \\theta$, which is true\nAs $\\pi$ is the smallest positive number for which $\\tan (\\theta+\\pi)=\\tan \\theta$\nTherefore, $\\pi$ is the period of $\\tan \\theta$.\n\n## Note\n\nBy adopting the procedure used in finding the periods of sine and tangent, we can prove that\n(i) $2 \\pi$ is the period of $\\cos \\theta$\n(ii) $2 \\pi$ is the period of $\\sec \\theta$\n(iii) $2 \\pi$ is the period of $\\sec \\theta$\n(iv) $\\pi$ is the period of $\\cot \\theta$\n\nExample 1 Find the periods of:\n(i) $\\sin 2 x$\n(ii) $3+\\tan \\frac{x}{3}$\n\nSolution (i) We know that the period of sine is $2 \\pi$\n\n$$\n\\therefore \\quad \\sin (2 x+2 \\pi)=\\sin 2 x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sin 2(x+\\pi)=\\sin 2 x\n$$\n\nIt means that the value of $\\sin 2 x$ repeats when $x$ is increased by $\\pi$.\nHence $\\pi$ is the period of $\\sin 2 x$.\n(ii) To find the period of $3+\\tan \\frac{x}{3}$, consider only $\\tan \\frac{x}{3}$.\n\nWe know that the period of tangent is $\\pi$\n$\\tan \\left(\\frac{x}{3}+\\pi\\right)=\\tan \\frac{x}{3} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\tan \\frac{1}{3}(x+3 \\pi)=\\tan \\frac{x}{3}$\nIt means that the value of $\\tan \\frac{x}{3}$ repeats when $x$ is increased by $3 \\pi$.\nHence the period of $3+\\tan \\frac{x}{3}$ is $3 \\pi$. The addition of constant number 3 to the tangent function does not affect the period.\n\n# EXERCISE 11.1\n\n1.

We have also established the following identities:\n\n| $\\sin (-\\theta)=-\\sin \\theta$ | $\\cos (-\\theta)=\\cos \\theta$ | $\\tan (-\\theta)=-\\tan \\theta$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $\\sin (\\pi-\\theta)=\\sin \\theta$ | $\\cos (\\pi-\\theta)=-\\cos \\theta$ | $\\tan (\\pi-\\theta)=-\\tan \\theta$ |\n| $\\sin (\\pi+\\theta)=-\\sin \\theta$ | $\\cos (\\pi+\\theta)=-\\cos \\theta$ | $\\tan (\\pi+\\theta)=\\tan \\theta$ |\n| $\\sin (2 \\pi-\\theta)=-\\sin \\theta$ | $\\cos (2 \\pi-\\theta)=\\cos \\theta$ | $\\tan (2 \\pi-\\theta)=-\\tan \\theta$ |\n\nBy using the above identities, we can easily find the values of trigonometric functions of the angles of the following measures:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n-30^{\\circ},-45^{\\circ},-60^{\\circ},-90^{\\circ} & \\pm 120^{\\circ}, \\pm 135^{\\circ}, \\pm 150^{\\circ}, \\pm 180^{\\circ} \\\\\n\\pm 210^{\\circ}, \\pm 225^{\\circ}, \\pm 240^{\\circ}, \\pm 270^{\\circ} & \\pm 300^{\\circ}, \\pm 315^{\\circ}, \\pm 330^{\\circ}, \\pm 360^{\\circ}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n### 11.4.1 Graphs of Trigonometric Functions\n\nTo plot the graph we shall follow these steps:\n(i) Table of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is constructed, when $x$ is the measure of the angle and $y$ is the value of the trigonometric function for the angle of measure $x$.\n(ii) The measures of the angles are taken along the $X$-axis.\n(iii) The values of the trigonometric functions are taken along the $Y$-axis.\n\n(iv) The points corresponding to the ordered pairs are plotted on the graph paper.\n(v) These points are joined with the help of smooth curves.\n\n# 11.4.2 Graph of $y=\\sin x$ from $-2 \\pi$ to $2 \\pi$\n\nWe know that the period of sine function is $2 \\pi$ so, we will first draw the graph for the interval from $0^{\\circ}$ to $360^{\\circ}$ (from 0 to $2 \\pi$ ).\n\nTo graph the sine function, first, recall that $-1 \\leq \\sin x \\leq 1$ for all $x \\in R$.\nWe know the range of the sine function is $[-1,1]$, so the graph will be between the horizontal lines $y=+1$ and $y=-1$\nThe table of the ordered pairs satisfying $y=\\sin x$ is as follows:\n\n| $x$ | 0 <br> or <br> $0^{\\circ}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\pi \\\\ 6 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 30^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\pi \\\\ 3 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 60^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\pi \\\\ 2 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 90^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} 2 \\pi \\\\ 3 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 120^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} 5 \\pi \\\\ 6 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 150^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\pi \\\\ 6 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 180^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} 7 \\pi \\\\ 6 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 210^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} 4 \\pi \\\\ 3 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 240^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} 3 \\pi \\\\ 2 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 270^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} 5 \\pi \\\\ 3 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 300^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} 11 \\pi \\\\ 6 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 330^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} 2 \\pi \\\\ 6 \\\\ \\text { or } \\\\ 360^{\\circ} \\end{gathered}$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $\\operatorname{Sin} x$ | 0 | 0.5 | 0.87 | 1 | 0.87 | 0.5 | 0 | $-0.5$ | $-0.87$ | $-1$ | $-0.87$ | $-0.5$ | 0 |\n\nTo draw the graph:\n(i) Take a convenient scale $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}1 \\text { side of small square on the } x \\text {-axis }=10^{\\circ} \\\\ 1 \\text { side of big square on the } y \\text {-axis }=1 \\text { unit }\\end{array}\\right.$\n(ii) Draw the coordinate axes.\n(iii) Plot the points corresponding to the ordered pairs in the table above i.e., $(0,0),\\left(30^{\\circ}, 0.5\\right),\\left(60^{\\circ}, 0.87\\right)$ and so on.\n(iv) Join the points with the help of a smooth curve as shown. So, we get the graph of $y=\\sin x$ from 0 to $360^{\\circ}$ i.e., from 0 to $2 \\pi$.\n\nNote As we see that the graphs of trigonometric functions are smooth curves and none of them is line segment or has sharp corners or breaks within their domain. This behaviour of the curve is called continuity. It means that the trigonometric functions are continuous, wherever they are defined. Moreover, as the trigonometric functions are periodic so their curves repeat after fixed intervals.\nIn the similar way, we can draw the graph for the interval from $0^{\\circ}$ to $-360^{\\circ}$. This will complete the graph of $y=\\sin x$ from $-360^{\\circ}$ to $360^{\\circ}$ (from $-2 \\pi$ to $2 \\pi$ ), which is given below:\nThe graph in the interval $[0,2 \\pi]$ is called a cycle and the maximum height of the wave from its mid line is called amplitude.

These functions are fundamental in mathematics because of the repetition of their values at definite cycles and are used to model various real-life situations, such as radio waves, light wave, and alternating current in electricity and are also known as a specific case of sinusoidal functions.\nThe functions of the form $f(\\theta)=a+b \\sin \\theta, g(\\theta)=a+b \\cos \\theta, f_{1}(\\theta)=a+b \\sin (c \\theta+d)$ and $g_{1}(\\theta)=a+b \\cos (c \\theta+d)$ are the types of sinusoidal functions.\nNow consider the general form of sinusoidal function $f_{1}(\\theta)=a+b \\sin (c \\theta+d) \\ldots$ (i) here ' $a$ ' represent the vertical shift refers to the vertical translation of the graph of the function, achieved by shifting the entire graph upward or downward. This shift, also known as the vertical displacement, moves the function's position along the $y$-axis without altering its shape or period. Amplitude $|b|$ is the maximum height of a wave\n\nmeasured from its midline. The period of (i) is equal to $\\frac{2 \\pi}{c}$. Phase shift ' $d$ ' indicates the horizontal translation of the graph of the function, determining how far the wave is shifted left or right along the $x$-axis. A positive $d$ shifts the graph to the left, while a negative $d$ shifts it to the right, altering the starting point of the wave without changing its shape or period.\nFor Example, consider the function $f(0)=1+3 \\sin (2 \\theta)$. Here $a=1$ is vertical shift, amplitude $=|b|=|3|=3$ and period $=\\frac{2 \\pi}{2}=\\pi$ as shown in the adjacent figure.\nNow, finding the maximum and minimum values of the functions $f(\\theta)=a+b \\sin (c \\theta+d)$ and $g(\\theta)=a+b \\cos (c \\theta+d)$ is not a difficult task. We know that the maximum absolute values of sine and cosine are equal to 1 , so the maximum value of the product $b \\sin \\theta$ is $|b|$.\nThus, the maximum value of $f(0)$ or $g(\\theta)$ is : $M=a+|b|$, whenever $\\sin \\theta=1$ or $\\cos \\theta=1$ where $M$ denotes the maximum value of the function.\nThe minimum value of $f(0)$ or $g(\\theta)$ function is $m=a-|b|$, whenever $\\sin \\theta=-1$ or $\\cos \\theta=-1$ and $m$ denotes the minimum value of the function.\n\nNote\nThe absolute value of $b$ is called the Amplitude of $f(\\theta)=a+b \\sin \\theta$. The value of the amplitude can also be determined using the formula\n\n$$\n\\text { Amplitude }=\\frac{\\text { Maximum value }- \\text { Minimum value }}{2}\n$$\n\nExample 2 Find the maximum and minimum values of the following functions:\n(i) $2+3 \\sin x$\n(ii) $5-2 \\cos 3 x$\n(iii) reciprocal of (ii)\n\nSolution (i) Let $f(x)=2+3 \\sin x$\nThe maximum value of $f(x)$ will occur when $\\sin x=1$. Here $a=2$ and $b=3$,\nMaximum value of the function: $M=a+|b|=2+3=5$\nThe minimum value of the function will occur when $\\sin x=-1$.\nMinimum value of the function: $m=a-|b|=2-3=-1$\nThus, maximum value of the function is 5 and the minimum value is -1\n\n(ii) Let $f(x)=5-2 \\cos 3 x$\n\nThe maximum value of $f(x)$ will occur when $\\cos 3 x=1$. Here $a=5$ and $b=-2$,\nMaximum value of the function: $M=a+|b|=5+|-2|=5+2=7$.\nThe minimum value of the function will occurs when $\\cos 3 x=-1$.\nMinimum value of the function: $m=a-|b|=5-|-2|=5-2=3$.\nThus, maximum value of the function is 7 and the minimum value is 3 .\n(iii) reciprocal of part (ii)\n\nThe reciprocal of $5-2 \\cos 3 x$ is $\\frac{1}{5-2 \\cos 3 x}$\nLet $g(x)=\\frac{1}{5-2 \\cos 3 x}$\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of $g(x)$, first we will find the maximum and minimum values of $5-2 \\cos 3 x$, which are 7 and 3 respectively.\nAfter finding the maximum and minimum values take their reciprocal. The reciprocal of the maximum value is the minimum of $g(x)$ and the reoprocal of the\nminimum value is the maximum of $g(x)$\nMaximum value of $g(x)=\\frac{1}{m}=\\frac{1}{3}=0.33$\nMinimum value of $g(x)=\\frac{1}{M}=\\frac{1}{7}=0.14$\n\n# 11.5.1 Real World Applications\n\n## Ferris Wheel Problems\n\nThe first Ferris wheel was invented by George W. Ferris. He built the first one for 1893 World'a Fair. A Ferris wheel is an important example of periodic motion that can be described using trigonometric functions, specifically sinusoidal functions. When we model the height of a rider on a Ferris wheel over time, we can use these functions to capture the periodic nature of the motion. The motion of Ferris wheel can be modeled by $f(t)=a+b \\sin (c t+d)$ or $f(t)=a+b \\cos (c t+d)$.\nExample 3 A Ferris wheel with a radius of 45 feet has its lowest point located 5 feet above the ground. It completes one full revolution every 60 seconds in counter clock wise direction. Model an equation that describes the height of a rider on the Ferris wheel as a function of time $t$. How high is the rider from the ground after 40 seconds?. Also graph the model equation. Solution Since it takes 60 seconds for the Ferris wheel to complete one full revolution\n\n(one cycle), which is the period of the Ferris wheel, that is period $=60$\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 \\pi}{c}=60 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c=\\frac{2 \\pi}{60} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c=\\frac{\\pi}{30}\n$$\n\nThe amplitude $b$ which is equal to the radius of a ferris wheel (in this case $b=45$ ).\nThe vertical shift $a$ is the height of the center of the Ferris wheel above the ground. Since the lowest point is 5 feet above the ground, so $a=5+b=5+45=50$.\nwe can model the height of a rider using (sine or cosine), because it reflects the periodic nature of the motion. We usually choose a cosine function if the rider starts at the maximum or minimum height, or a sine function if the rider starts at the midpoint.\nSince the rider starts at the lowest point and goes up, we can easily model the required equation as a negative cosine function so,\n$h(t)=-b \\cos (c t)+a$, where $t$ is time and $h$ is height.\nNow substituting the above values we get the function $h(t)=-45 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{30} t\\right)+50$,\nwhich is the required equation of Ferris wheel.\nNext, we find the height of the rider at $t=40$ seconds.\n\n$$\nh(t)=-45 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{30} t\\right)+50\n$$\n\nFor $\\quad t=40$, we have\n\n$$\nh(40)=-45 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{30}, 40\\right)+50=72.5 \\text { feet }\n$$\n\nThus, height of rider after 40 second is 72.5 feet.\nThe graph of the model equation is shown below.\nExample 4 The water level L (in feet) of a tidal river varies throughout the day. Suppose the level of the tidal river can be modeled by the equation: $L(t)=8+4 \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6} t\\right)$, where $t$ denotes the time (in hours). The water level oscillates 4 feet above and below an average level of 8 feet.\n(a) Find the water level at $t=3$ hours?\n(b) What is the minimum water level?\n\nSolution (a) Given equation of water level: $L(t)=8+4 \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6} t\\right)$\nTo find the water level, substitute $t=3$ into the equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& L(3)=8+4 \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cdot 3\\right)=8+4 \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\\\\n& L(3)=8+4(1)=12\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, water level at $t=3$ hours is 12 feet.\n(b) Now, to find the minimum water level, we need to determine when the sine function attains its minimum value. We know that the minimum value of $\\sin t=-1$, substitute the $\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6} t\\right)=-1$ into the equation\n\n$$\nL(t)=8+4 \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6} t\\right)=8+4(-1)=8-4=4\n$$\n\nThus, minimum water level of the tidal river is 4 feet.\nExample 5 From a point 100 m above the surface of a lake, the angle of elevation of a peak of a cliff is found to be $15^{\\circ}$ and the angle of depression of the image of the peak is $30^{\\circ}$. Find the height of the peak.\nSolution Let $A$ be the top of the peak $\\overline{A M}$ and $\\overline{M B}$ be its image. Let $P$ be the point of observation and $L$ be the point just below $P$ (on the surface of the lake).\nFrom $P$, draw $\\overline{P Q} \\perp \\overline{A M}$.\nLet $m \\overline{P Q}=y$ metres and $m \\overline{A M}=h$ metres.\n$\\therefore \\quad m \\overline{A Q}=h-m \\overline{Q M}=h-m \\overline{P L}=h-100$\nFrom the figure,\n\n$$\n\\tan 15^{\\circ}=\\frac{A Q}{P Q}=\\frac{h-100}{y} \\text { and } \\tan 30^{\\circ}=\\frac{B Q}{P Q}=\\frac{100+h}{y}\n$$\n\nBy division, we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\tan 15^{\\circ}}{\\tan 30^{\\circ}}=\\frac{h-100}{h+100}\n$$\n\nBy Componendo and Dividendo, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{\\tan 15^{\\circ}+\\tan 30^{\\circ}}{\\tan 15^{\\circ}-\\tan 30^{\\circ}}=\\frac{h-100+h+100}{h-100-h-100}=\\frac{2 h}{-200}=\\frac{h}{-100} \\\\\n& \\therefore \\quad h=\\frac{\\tan 30^{\\circ}+\\tan 15^{\\circ}}{\\tan 30^{\\circ}-\\tan 15^{\\circ}} \\times 100=[\\begin{array}{c}\n0.5774+0.2679 \\\\\n0.5774-0.2679\n\\end{array}] \\times 100 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow h=273.1179\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence height of the peak $=273 \\mathrm{~m}$.

This unit will introduce and explore how to demonstrate and find the limit of a sequence and a function, understand continuous and discontinuous functions, and apply these concepts in various contexts such as economics, finance, and natural sciences.\n\n### 12.1 Limit of a Function\n\nThe concept of limit of a function is the basis on which the structure of calculus rests. Before the definition of the limit of a function, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the following phrases.\n\n### 12.1.1 Meaning of the Phrase \" $x$ approaches zero\"\n\nSuppose a sequence $x_{n}=\\frac{1}{n^{2}}$ assumes a sequence of values as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2^{2}}, \\frac{1}{2^{3}}, \\frac{1}{2^{4}} \\cdots, \\frac{1}{2^{n}}, \\cdots\n$$\n\nWe can see that the sequence $x_{n}=\\frac{1}{n^{2}}$ is becoming smaller and smaller as $n$ increases and can be made as small as we please by taking \" $n$ \" sufficiently large. In other words, $x_{n}=\\frac{1}{n^{2}}$ becoming closer and closer to 0 as $n$ becoming large. This unending decrease of $x_{n}$ is denoted by $x_{n} \\rightarrow 0$ and read as \" $x_{n}$ approaches zero\" or \" $x_{n}$ tends to zero as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. That is, the limit of the sequence $x_{n}$ is 0 .\n\n### 12.1.2 Meaning of the Phrase \" $x$ approaches infinity\"\n\nSuppose a sequence $x_{n}=10^{n}$ assumes values as $1,10,10^{2}, 10^{3}, \\ldots, 10^{n}, \\ldots$\nIt is clear that the sequence $x_{n}$ is becoming larger and larger as $n$ increases and can be made as large as we please by taking $n$ sufficiently large. This unending increase of the sequence $x_{n}$ is symbolically written as \" $x_{n} \\rightarrow \\infty$ \" and is read as \" $x_{n}$ approaches infinity\" or \" $x_{n}$ tends to infinity\" as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$\n\n# 12.1.3 Meaning of the Phrase \" $x$ approaches $a$ \"\n\nSymbolically it is written as \" $x \\rightarrow a$ \" which means that $x$ is sufficiently close to $a$ but different from the number $a$, from both the left and right sides of $a$ that is $x-a$ becomes smaller and smaller as we please but $x-a \\neq 0$.\n\nPoint to remember:\nThe symbol $x \\rightarrow 0$ is quite different from $x=0$.\n$x \\rightarrow 0$ means that $x$ is very close to zero but not actually zero.\n$x=0$ means that $x$ is actually zero.\n\n### 12.1.4 Concept of Limit of a Function\n\n## (1) By Finding the Area of Circumscribed Regular Polygon\n\nConsider a circle of unit radius which circumscribes a square (4-sided regular polygon) as shown in Figure 12.1.\nThe side of square is $\\sqrt{2}$ and its area is 2 square units. It is clear that the area of inscribed 4 -sided polygon is less than the area of the circum-circle $\\pi=3.142\\left(\\pi r^{2}=\\pi(1)^{2}=\\pi=3.142\\right)$\nFigure 12.1: 4 -sided polygon\nFigure 12.2: 8 -sided polygon\nFigure 12.3:16-sided polygon\n\nBisecting the arcs between the vertices of the square, we get an inscribed 8 -sided regular polygon as shown in Figure 12.2. Its area is $2 \\sqrt{2}=2.828$ square units which is closer to the area of circum-circle. A further similar bisection of the arcs gives an inscribed 16 -sided regular polygon as shown in Figure 12.3 with area 3.061 square units which is more closer to the area of circum-circle.\nIt follows that as \" $n$ \", the number of sides of the inscribed polygon increases, the area of polygon increases and becoming near to 3.142 which is the area of circle of unit radius.\n\nWe express this situation by saying that the limiting value of the area of the inscribed polygon is the area of the circle as $n$ approaches infinity, i.e.,\n\nArea of inscribed polygon $\\rightarrow$ Area of circle as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$\n\n# (ii) Numerical Approach\n\nConsider the function $f(x)=x^{3}$\nThe domain of $f(x)$ is the set of all real numbers.\nLet us find the limit of $f(x)=x^{3}$ as $x$ approaches 2 .\nThe table of values of $f(x)$ for different values of $x$ as $x$ approaches 2 from left and right is as follows:\n\nFrom left of $2 \\longrightarrow 2$ from right of 2\n\n| $x$ | 1 | 1.5 | 1.8 | 1.9 | 1.99 | 1.999 | 1.9999 | 2.0001 | 2.001 | 2.01 | 2.1 | 2.2 | 2.5 | 3 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $f(x)=x^{3}$ | 1 | 3.375 | 5.832 | 6.859 | 7.8806 | 7.8806 | 7.9988 | 8.0012 | 8.012 | 8.1206 | 9.261 | 10.648 | 15.625 | 27 |\n\nThe table shows that, as $x$ gets closer and closer to 2 (sufficiently close to 2 ), from both sides, $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to 8 .\nWe say that 8 is the limit of $f(x)$ when $x$ approaches 2 and is written as:\n\n$$\nf(x) \\rightarrow 8 \\text { as } x \\rightarrow 2 \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 2} x^{2}=8\n$$\n\n### 12.1.5 Limit of a Function\n\nLet a function $f(x)$ be defined in an open interval near the number \" $a$ \" (need not be at a). If, as $x$ approaches \" $a$ \" from both left and right side of \" $a$ \" $f(x)$ approaches a specific number \"L\" then \"L\", is called the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$. Symbolically it is written as:\n$\\lim _{x \\rightarrow a} f(x)=\\mathrm{L}$ read as \"limit of $f(x)$ as $x \\rightarrow a$, is $L$ \".\nIt is neither desirable nor practicable to find the limit of a function by numerical approach. We must be able to evaluate a limit in some mechanical way. The theorems on limits will serve this purpose. Their proofs will be discussed in higher classes.\n\n### 12.1.6 Theorems on Limits of Functions\n\nLet $f$ and $g$ be two functions for which $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} f(x)=L$ and $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} g(x)=M$, then\nTheorem 1: (i) $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow a} x^{p}=a^{p}$, where $p>0$ and $p \\in R$\n(ii) $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow a} c=c$\n\nTheorem 2: (a) The limit of the sum of two functions is equal to the sum of their limits.\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a}[f(x)+g(x)]=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} f(x)+\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} g(x)=L+M\n$$\n\nFor example, $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 1}(x+5)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 1} x+\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 1} 5=1+5=6$\n\n(b) The limit of the difference of two functions is equal to the difference of their limits.\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a}[f(x)-g(x)]=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} f(x)-\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} g(x)=L-M\n$$\n\nFor example, $\\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 3}(x-5)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 3}(x)-\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 3} 5=3-5=-2$\n(c) If $k$ is any real number, then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a}[k f(x)]=k \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} f(x)=k L\n$$\n\nFor example, $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2}(3 x)=3 \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2}(x)=3(2)=6$\n(d) The limit of the product of the functions is equal to the product of their limits.\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a}[f(x) g(x)]=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} f(x) \\cdot \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} g(x)=L M\n$$\n\nFor example, $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 1}(2 x)(x+4)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 1}(2 x) \\cdot \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 1}(x+4)=(2)(5)=10$\n(e) The limit of the quotient of the functions is equal to the quotient of their limits provided the limit of denominator is non-zero.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a}\\left[\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right]=\\frac{\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} f(x)}{\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} g(x)}=\\frac{L}{M}, \\text { provided } g(x) \\neq 0 \\text { in a neighborhood of } \\\\\n& a \\text { and } M \\neq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor example: $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2}\\left[\\frac{3 x+4}{x+3}\\right]=\\frac{\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2}(3 x+4)}{\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2}(x+3)}=\\frac{6+4}{2+3}=\\frac{10}{5}=2$\n(f) Limit of $[f(x)]^{\\prime}$, where $n$ is an integer\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a}[f(x)]^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left[\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} f(x)\\right]^{\\prime \\prime}=L^{n}\n$$\n\nFor example, $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 4}(2 x-3)^{3}=\\left(\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 4}(2 x-3)\\right)^{3}=(5)^{3}=125$\nWe conclude from the theorems on limits that limits are evaluated by merely substituting the number that $x$ approaches into the function.\n\n# 12.2 Limits of Important Functions\n\nIf by substituting the number that $x$ approaches into the function, we get $\\binom{0}{0}$, then one possible way to evaluate the limits is as follows:\nWe simplify the given function by using algebraic techniques of making factors if possible and cancel the common factors. The method explained in the following important limits.\n\n### 12.2.1 $\\underline{\\operatorname{Lim}} \\frac{x^{n}-a^{n}}{x-a}=n a^{n-1}$ where $n$ is a non-zero integer and $a>0$\n\nCase I: Suppose $n$ is a positive integer.\nBy substituting $x=a$, we get $\\binom{0}{0}$ form, so we make factors as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^{n}-a^{n} & =(x-a)\\left(x^{n-1}+a x^{n-2}+a^{2} x^{n-3}+\\ldots+a^{n-1}\\right) \\\\\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow a} \\frac{x^{n}-a^{n}}{x-a} & =\\lim _{x \\rightarrow a} \\frac{(x-a)\\left(x^{n-1}+a x^{n-2}+a^{2} x^{n-3}+\\ldots+a^{n-1}\\right)}{x-a} \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a}\\left(x^{n-1}+a x^{n-2}+a^{2} x^{n-3}+\\ldots+a^{n-1}\\right) \\\\\n& =a^{n-1}+a \\quad a^{n-2}+a^{2} a^{n-3}+a^{3} a^{n-4}+\\ldots+a^{n-1} \\\\\n& =a^{n-1}+a^{n-1}+a^{n-1}+a^{n-1} \\ldots+a^{n-1}=n a^{n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCase II: Suppose $n$ is a negative integer (Say $n=-m$ ) where $m$ is a positive integer.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Now, } \\quad \\frac{x^{n}-a^{n}}{x-a}=\\frac{x^{-n}-a^{-n}}{x-a}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{x^{m}}-\\frac{1}{a^{m}}}{x-a}=\\frac{\\frac{a^{m}-x^{m}}{x^{n} a^{m}}}{x-a} \\\\\n& \\therefore \\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} \\frac{x^{n}-a^{n}}{x-a}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a}\\left(\\frac{-1}{x^{m} a^{m}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{x^{n}-a^{m}}{x-a}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{-1}{a^{m} a^{m}}\\left(m a^{m-1}\\right) \\quad \\text { (by Case }-1 \\text { ) } \\\\\n& =-m a^{-m-1} \\\\\n& \\therefore \\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a}\\left(\\frac{x^{n}-a^{n}}{x-a}\\right)=n a^{n-1} \\quad \\because n=-m\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# 12.2.2 $\\underline{\\operatorname{Lim}}_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sqrt{x+a}-\\sqrt{a}}{x}=\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{a}}$, where $n$ is an integer and $a>0$.\n\nBy substituting $x=0$, we have $\\left(\\frac{0}{0}\\right)$ form, so rationalizing the numerator.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sqrt{x+a}-\\sqrt{a}}{x} & =\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{x+a}-\\sqrt{a}}{x}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{x+a}+\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{x+a}+\\sqrt{a}}\\right)=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{x+a-a}{x(\\sqrt{x+a}+\\sqrt{a})} \\\\\n& =\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+a}+\\sqrt{a}}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+a}+\\sqrt{a}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{a}}=\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{a}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 1 Evaluate: (i) $\\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 1} \\frac{x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-x}$\n(ii) $\\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3} \\frac{x-3}{\\sqrt{x}-\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nSolution (i) $\\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 1} \\frac{x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-x} \\quad\\left(\\frac{0}{0}\\right)$ form.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 1} \\frac{x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-x} & =\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 1} \\frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x(x-1)}=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 1} \\frac{x+1}{x} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1+1}{1}=\\frac{2}{1}=2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(ii) $\\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3} \\frac{x-3}{\\sqrt{x}-\\sqrt{3}}=\\underline{\\operatorname{Lim}}_{x \\rightarrow 3} \\frac{(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{x}=\\sqrt{3})}{(\\sqrt{x}=\\sqrt{3})}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 3}(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{3}=2 \\sqrt{3}$\n\n### 12.2.3 Limit at Infinity\n\nWe have studied the limits of the functions $f(x), f(x) . g(x)$ and $\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, when $x \\rightarrow c$ (a number)\nLet us see what happens to the limit of the function $f(x)$ if $c$ is $+\\infty$ or $-\\infty$ (limits at infinity) i.e., when $x \\rightarrow+\\infty$ or $x \\rightarrow-\\infty$.\n(a) Limit as $x \\rightarrow+\\infty$\n\nLet $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$, when $x \\neq 0$\nThis function has the property that the value of $f(x)$ can be made as close as we please to zero when the number $x$ is sufficiently large.\nWe express this phenomenon by writing $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{x}=0$\n\n(b) Limit as $x \\rightarrow-\\infty$\n\nThis type of limits are handled in the same way as limits as $x \\rightarrow+\\infty$.\ni.e., $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow-\\infty} \\frac{1}{x}=0$, where $x \\neq 0$.\n\nThe following theorem is useful for evaluating limit at infinity.\nTheorem: Let $p$ be a positive rational number. If $x^{p}$ is defined, then\n$\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow+\\infty} \\frac{a}{x^{p}}=0$ and $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow-\\infty} \\frac{a}{x^{p}}=0$, where $a$ is any real number.\nFor example, $\\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow+\\infty} \\frac{6}{x^{3}}=0$ and $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow+\\infty} \\frac{-5}{\\sqrt[3]{x}}=0$\n\n# 12.2.4 Limit of a Sequence\n\nLet $\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}$ be a sequence, the limit of a sequence $\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}$ is the value $L$ that the terms of the sequence approach as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, that is,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{n}=L\n$$\n\nIf such an $L$ exists, the sequence is said to converge to $L$ and $\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}$ is called convergent sequence. If no such $L$ exists, the sequence is said to diverge.\nFor example, consider the sequence $\\left\\{a_{n}=\\frac{1}{n}\\right\\}$ : As $n \\rightarrow \\infty, \\frac{1}{n} \\rightarrow 0$\nSo, we write $\\operatorname{Lim}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{n}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}=0$.\nExample 2 Find the limit of the sequence $a_{n}=\\frac{2 n+3}{n+1}$.\nSolution We can simplify the sequence:\n\n$$\na_{n}=\\frac{2 n+3}{n+1}=\\frac{n\\left(2+\\frac{3}{n}\\right)}{n\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)}=\\frac{2+\\frac{3}{n}}{1+\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\n\nAs $n \\rightarrow \\infty, \\frac{3}{n} \\rightarrow 0$ and $\\frac{1}{n} \\rightarrow 0$, so we are left with: $\\operatorname{Lim}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} a_{n}=\\frac{2+0}{1+0}=2$\n\n$$\n\\text { Thus, } \\operatorname{Lim}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{2 n+3}{n+1}=2\n$$\n\nDivergent Sequences: A sequence is divergent if it is not convergent. Divergence can occur in the following ways:\n\n- The sequence may increase or decrease without bound (e.g., $a_{n}=n^{2}$ diverges to infinity).\n- The sequence may oscillate between different values and not settle near any one value (e.g., $a_{n}=(-1)^{n}$ oscillates between -1 and 1 , so it does not converge).\n\n# 12.2.5 Methods for Evaluating the Limits at Infinity\n\nIn this case we first divide each term of both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of $x$ that appears in the denominator and then use the theorems on limit.\n\nExample 3 Evaluate $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x

They require geometric arguments, so we evaluate an important theorem.\n\n### 12.2.9 If $\\theta$ is measured in radian, then $1 \\operatorname{lin} \\sin \\theta=1$.\n\nProof: To evaluate this limit, we apply a new technique. Take $\\theta$ be positive acute central angle of a sector of a circle with radius $r=1$. As shown in the figure, $O A B$ represents a sector of a circle. Join $A$ and $B$ and extend $O B$ to $D$ such that $O A \\perp \\overline{A D}$. Also draw $\\overline{B C} \\perp \\overline{O C}$ on $\\overline{O A}$.\nGiven $|O A|=|O B|=1 \\quad$ (radii of unit circle)\nIn the right $\\triangle O C B, \\sin \\theta=\\frac{|\\overline{B C}|}{\\mid \\overline{O B}} \\mid=|\\overline{B C}|$\nIn the right $\\triangle O A D, \\tan \\theta=\\frac{|\\overline{A D}|}{|\\overline{O A}|}=|\\overline{A D}|$\n(i) Area of $\\triangle O A B=\\frac{1}{2}|\\overline{O A}||\\overline{B C}|=\\frac{1}{2}(1)(\\sin \\theta)=\\frac{1}{2} \\sin \\theta$\n(ii) Area of sector $O A B=\\frac{1}{2} r^{2} \\theta=\\frac{1}{2}(1)(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{2} \\theta \\quad$ and\n(iii) Area of $\\triangle O A D=\\frac{1}{2}|\\overline{O A}||\\overline{A D}|=\\frac{1}{2}(1)(\\tan \\theta)=\\frac{1}{2} \\tan \\theta$\n\nFrom the figure we see that\nArea of $\\triangle O A B<$ Area of sector $O A B<$ Area of $\\triangle O A D$\nFigure 12.4\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{2} \\sin \\theta<\\frac{\\theta}{2}<\\frac{1}{2} \\tan \\theta$\n\nAs $\\sin \\theta$ is positive, so on division by $\\frac{1}{2} \\sin \\theta$, we get\n\n$$\n1<\\frac{\\theta}{\\sin \\theta}<\\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta} \\quad\\left(0<\\theta<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\ni.e., $\\quad 1>\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\theta}>\\cos \\theta \\quad$ or $\\quad \\cos \\theta<\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\theta}<1$\nwhen $\\theta \\rightarrow 0, \\cos \\theta \\rightarrow 1$\nSince $\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\theta}$ is sandwiched between 1 and a quantity approaching 1 itself. So, by the sandwich theorem, it must also approach 1 that is, $\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\theta}=1$\n\n# Example 7 Evaluate $\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin 7 \\theta}{\\theta}$\n\nSolution\nLet $x=7 \\theta$, so that $\\theta=\\frac{x}{7}$\nwhen $\\theta \\rightarrow 0$ we have $x \\rightarrow 0$\n\n$$\n\\therefore \\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin 7 \\theta}{\\theta}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{\\frac{x}{7}}=7 \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x}=(7)(1)=7\n$$\n\nExample 8 Evaluate $\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1-\\cos \\theta}{\\theta}$\nSolution $\\frac{1-\\cos \\theta}{\\theta}=\\frac{1-\\cos \\theta}{\\theta} \\cdot \\frac{1+\\cos \\theta}{1+\\cos \\theta}=\\frac{1-\\cos ^{2} \\theta}{\\theta(1+\\cos \\theta)}$\n\n$$\n=\\frac{\\sin ^{2} \\theta}{\\theta(1+\\cos \\theta)}=\\sin \\theta\\left(\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\theta}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\cos \\theta}\\right)\n$$\n\n$\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0}\\left(\\frac{1-\\cos \\theta}{0}\\right)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0} \\sin \\theta \\cdot \\operatorname{Lim}_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\theta} \\cdot \\operatorname{Lim}_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\cos \\theta}\\right)=(0)(1)\\left(\\frac{1}{1+1}\\right)=0$\n\n## EXERCISE 12.1\n\n1.

However, in some cases it is necessary to investigate one sided limits that is, the left hand limit and the right hand limit.\n\n## (i) The Left Hand Limit\n\n$\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c^{\\prime}} f(x)=L$ is read as the limit of $f(x)$ is equal to $L$ as $x$ approaches $c$ from the left i.e., for all $x$ sufficiently close to $c$, but less than $c$, the value of $f(x)$ can be made as close as we please to $L$.\n(ii) The Right Hand Limit\n$\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c^{\\prime}} f(x)=M$ is read as the limit of $f(x)$ is equal to $M$ as $x$ approaches $c$ from the right i.e., for all $x$ sufficiently close to $c$, but greater than $c$, the value of $f(x)$ can be made as close as we please to $M$.\n\n### 12.3.2 Criterion for Existence of Limit of a Function\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x)=L \\text { if and only if } \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x)=L\n$$\n\nExample 9 Determine whether $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2} f(x)$ and $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 4} f(x)$ exist, when\n\n$$\nf(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n2 x+1 & \\text { if } 0 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\\\\n7-x & \\text { if } 2<x<4 \\\\\nx & \\text { if } 4 \\leq x \\leq 6\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nSolution (i) $\\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2}(2 x+1)=4+1=5$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2^{\\prime}} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2}(7-x)=7-2=5 \\\\\n& \\text { Since } \\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2^{\\prime}} f(x)=5 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2} f(x) \\text { exists and is equal to } 5 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(ii) $\\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 4^{\\prime}} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 4^{\\prime}}(7-x)=7-4=3$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 4^{\\prime}} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 4^{\\prime}}(x)=4\n$$\n\nSince $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 4^{\\prime}} f(x) \\neq \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 4^{\\prime}} f(x)$\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 4} f(x)$ does not exist.\n\n# 12.3.3 Continuity of a Function at a Point\n\n## (a) Continuous Function\n\nA function $f$ is said to be continuous at a number \" $c$ \" if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied.\n(i) $f(c)$ is defined\n(ii) $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x)$ exists\n(iii) $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x)=f(c)$\n(b) Discontinuous Function\n\nIf one or more of these three conditions fail to hold at \" $c$ \", then the function $f$ is said to be discontinuous at \" $c$ \".\n\nExample 10 Consider the function $f(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}$, discuss the continuity of $f$ at $x=1$.\nSolution Here $f(1)$ is not defined.\n$\\Rightarrow f(x)$ is discontinuous at 1 .\nExample 11 For $f(x)=3 x^{2}-5 x+4$, discuss continuity of $f$ at $x=1$.\nSolution $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 1} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 1}\\left(3 x^{2}-5 x+4\\right)=3-5+4=2$ and $f(1)=3-5+4=2$\n\n$$\n\\Rightarrow \\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 1} f(x)=f(1)\n$$\n\nTherefore, $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=1$\nExample 12 Discuss the continuity of the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ at $x=3$\n(a) $f(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\frac{x^{2}-9}{x-3} & \\text { if } \\quad x \\neq 3 \\\\ 6 & \\text { if } \\quad x=3\\end{array}\\right.$\n(b) $g(x)=\\left\\{\\frac{x^{2}-9}{x-3} \\quad \\text { if } \\quad x \\neq 3\\right.$\n\nSolution (a) $f(3)=6$\nNow, $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 3} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 3} \\frac{x^{2}-9}{x-3}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 3} \\frac{(x+3)(x-3)}{(x-3)} \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 3}(x+3)=3+3=6\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs $\\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 3} f(x)=6=f(3)$\n$f(x)$ is continuous at $x=3$.

Find the limit of the amount of substance as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe need to compute the limit: $\\operatorname{Lim}_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} A(t)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} A_{0} e^{-k t}$\nAs $t \\rightarrow \\infty, e^{-k t} \\rightarrow 0$, so $\\operatorname{Lim}_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} A_{0} e^{-k t}=A_{0} \\times 0=0$\nThus, the amount of radioactive substance approaches 0 as time increases indefinitely.\n\n## Example 15 Finance (Compound Interest)\n\nThe value of an investment grows according to the formula for continuous compounding $A(t)=P_{0} e^{r t}$, where $P_{0}$ is the initial principal, $r$ is the annual interest rate, and $t$ is the time in years. What happens to the value of the investment as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$ ?\n\n# Unit 42 Limit of Sequences and Conthority\n\nSolution We need to compute the limit: $\\operatorname{Lim}_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} A(t)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} P_{0} e^{r t}$\nSince $e^{r t} \\rightarrow \\infty$ as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$ for any positive $r$, the value of the investment grows without bound:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} P_{0} e^{r t}=\\infty\n$$\n\nThus, the value of the investment increases indefinitely as time approaches infinity.\n\n## Example16 Economics (Supply and Demand)\n\nIn economics, the demand function $D(p)$ decreases as the price $p$ increases. Suppose the demand function is given by $D(p)=\\frac{100}{p+1}$, where $p$ is the price in dollars. Find the limit of the demand as the price becomes very large, i.e., $\\operatorname{Lim}_{p \\rightarrow \\infty} D(p)$ :\n\nSolution $\\operatorname{Lim}_{p \\rightarrow \\infty} D(p)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{p \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{100}{p+1}$\nAs $p \\rightarrow \\infty$, the denominator becomes very large, so $\\operatorname{Lim}_{p \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{100}{p+1}=0$\nThus, as the price becomes very large, the demand approaches 0 .\n\n## Example17 Astronomy\n\nThe apparent brightness $B(d)$ of a star decreases as the distance from Earth increases following the inverse square law $B(d)=\\frac{L}{d^{2}}$, where $L$ is the star's luminosity. Find the limit of the brightness as $d \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nSolution $\\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{d \\rightarrow \\infty} B(d)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{d \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{L}{d^{2}}$\nAs $d \\rightarrow \\infty$ the denominator becomes very large, so:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{d \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{L}{d^{2}}=0\n$$\n\nThus, as the distance increases indefinitely, the apparent brightness of the star approaches 0 .\n\n## EXERCISE 12.3\n\n1.

          "title": "Differentiation\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThe ancient Greeks knew the concepts of area, volume, centroids etc. which are related to integral calculus. Later on, in the seventeenth century, Sir Isaac Newton, an English mathematician ( 1642 - 1727) and Gottfried Whilhe G. W. Leibniz, a German mathematician, ( 1646 - 1716) considered the problem of instantaneous rates of change. They reached independently to the invention of differential calculus. After the development of calculus, mathematics became a powerful tool for dealing with rates of change and describing the physical universe.\n\n### 13.1 Tangent to a Curve at a Point\n\nLet $P(x, f(x))$ and $Q(x+\\delta x, f(x+\\delta x))$ be two points on arc $A B$ of graph of $f$ defined by the equation $y=f(x)$ as shown in Figure 13.1.\nWhere $\\delta x$ is the increment in the value of $x$ (read as delta $x$ )\nThe line $P Q$ is secant of the curve and slope of\nFigure 13.1\nsecant line passing through $P(x, f(x))$ and $Q(x+\\delta x, f(x+\\delta x))$ is:\n\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{am}}=\\frac{R Q}{P R}=\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}\n$$\n\nWhere $m_{\\text {anc }}$ is slope of the secant line. Revolving the secant line $P Q$ towards $P$, some of its successive positions $P Q_{1}, P Q_{2}, P Q_{3}, \\ldots$ are shown in the Figure 13.2. Points $Q_{i}(i=1,2,3, \\ldots)$ are getting closer and closer to the point $P$ and $P R$ are approaching zero.\nFigure 13.2\n\nIn other words, as $\\delta x \\rightarrow 0$, the point $Q$ approaches $P$, and the secant line becomes the tangent line. The revolving secant line becomes the tangent line $P T$ at $P$ while $\\delta x$\n\napproaches zero, that is,\n\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{ten}}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}\n$$\n\nwhere $m_{\\text {ten }}$ denotes the slope of tangent line. We see that $m_{\\text {ten }}$ is the limit of $m_{\\text {ten }}$ as $Q$ approaches $P$ along the curve $y=f(x)$.\nExample 1 Find the gradient and an equation of tangent line to the graph of $f(x)=x^{2}-2$ at the point $P(-1,-1)$.\nSolution To find the gradient or slope of the tangent line at point $(-1,-1)$, put $x=-1$ in equation (2)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_{\\text {ten }} & =\\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(-1+\\delta x)-f(-1)}{\\delta x} \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{(-1+\\delta x)^{2}-2-\\left((-1)^{2}-2\\right)}{\\delta x} \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1-2 \\delta x+\\delta x^{2}-2-(1-2)}{\\delta x} \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1-2 \\delta x+\\delta x^{2}-2+1}{\\delta x}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{-2 \\delta x+\\delta x^{2}}{\\delta x} \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\delta x(-2+\\delta x)}{\\delta x}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0}(-2+\\delta x)=-2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow to find the equation of tangent line we use the point slope form of equation of line with slope $=-2$ and point $(-1,-1)$\n$y-(-1)=-2(x-(-1)) \\Rightarrow y+1=-2 x-2$\nor $y=-2 x-3$, which is the required equation of tangent line.\nThe graph of $f$ and tangent line are shown in the above figure.\n\n# 13.2 Derivative as the Limit of a Difference Quotient\n\nLet $f$ be a real valued function continuous in the interval $\\left(x, x_{1}\\right) \\subseteq D_{f}$ (domain of $f$ ), then difference quotient $\\frac{f\\left(x_{1}\\right)-f(x)}{x_{1}-x}$\nrepresents the average rate of change in the value of $f$ with respect to the change $x_{1}-x$ in the value of independent variable $x$.\n\nIf $x_{1}$ approaches to $x$, then $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x_{1} \\rightarrow x} \\frac{f\\left(x_{1}\\right)-f(x)}{x_{1}-x}$\nprovided this limit exists, is called the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ with respect to $x$ and is written as $f^{\\prime}(x)$.\nIf $x_{1}=x+\\delta x$ i.e., $x_{1}-x=\\delta x$, then the expression (i) can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{x_{x} \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}\n$$\n\n(iii)\nprovided the limit exist, is defined to be the derivative of $f$ (or differential coefficient of $f$ ) with respect to $x$ and is denoted by $f^{\\prime}(x)$ (read as \" $f$-prime of $x^{\\prime \\prime}$ ). The domain of $f^{\\prime}$ consists of all $x$ for which the limit exists. If $x \\in D_{f}$ and $f^{\\prime}(x)$ exists, then $f$ is said to be differentiable at $x$. The process of finding $f^{\\prime}$ is called differentiation.\n\n# 13.2.1 Derivative as the Rate of Change of Velocity\n\nThe rate of change is a fundamental concept in describing the motion of an object moving in a straight line. In physics, this is typically analyzed using position, velocity, and acceleration, which are all related through derivatives (rates of change).\nThe position versus time graph provides a simple interpretation of the average velocity over a given time interval.\nSuppose a particle moves in a straight line and its position at time $t$ is given by the function $s(t)$. The average velocity over the interval from $t$ to $t_{1}$ denoted by $v_{\\text {avg }}$ is defined as:\n\n$$\nv_{\\text {ang }}=\\frac{s\\left(t_{1}\\right)-s(t)}{t_{1}-t}\n$$\n\nEquation (i) also represents the slope of secant line passing through the points $(t, s(t))$ and $\\left(t_{1}, s\\left(t_{1}\\right)\\right)$. If the interval $t_{1}-t$ is not small, this average velocity does not accurately represent the rate of change at time $t$.\nTo illustrate this, consider a particle whose position at time $t$ (in seconds) is given by a function $s(t)=t^{2}+t$ in metres. The average rate of change over various time intervals\n\nStarting at $t=3$ seconds is shown in the table below:\n\n| Interval | $t=3$ secs to $t=5$ secs | $t=3$ secs to $t=4$ secs | $t=3$ secs to $t=3.5$ secs |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Average velocity | $\\begin{gathered} s(5)-s(3) \\\\ 5-3 \\end{gathered}=\\frac{30-12}{2}=9$ | $\\begin{gathered} s(4)-s(3) \\\\ 4-3 \\end{gathered}=\\frac{20-12}{1}=8$ | $\\begin{gathered} s(3.5)-s(3) \\\\ 3.5-3 \\end{gathered}=\\frac{63}{4}-12$ $0.5=7.5$ |\n| | $\\begin{gathered} 50 \\\\ 40 \\\\ 30 \\\\ 20 \\\\ 10 \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} 50 \\\\ 40 \\\\ 30 \\\\ 20 \\\\ 10 \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} 50 \\\\ 40 \\\\ 30 \\\\ 20 \\\\ 10 \\end{gathered}$ |\n\nWe observe that these values are not closely approximate the particle's velocity at exactly 3 seconds. To obtain a better approximation of velocity at $x=3$, we use smaller intervals:\n\n| Interval | Average velocity |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| $t=3$ secs to $t=3.1$ secs | $\\begin{gathered} \\frac{((3.1)^{2}+3.1)-12}{3.1-3}=\\frac{0.71}{0.1}=7.1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{gathered}$ |\n| $t=3$ secs to $t=3.01$ secs | $\\begin{gathered} \\frac{((3.01)^{2}+3.01)-12}{3.01-3}=\\frac{0.0701}{0.01}=7.01 \\\\ \\hline \\end{gathered}$ |\n| $t=3$ secs to $t=3.001$ secs | $\\begin{gathered} \\frac{((3.001)^{2}+3.001)-12}{3.001-3}=\\frac{0.007001}{0.001}=7.001 \\end{gathered}$ |\n\nWe see as the length of the time interval decreases, the average velocity becomes instantaneous velocity at $t=3$. Based on the trend, we estimate the instantaneous velocity to be approximately $7 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{sec}$.\nThus, over a sufficiently small interval, the velocity changes negligibly. If $t_{1}$ is very close to $t$, the average velocity over $t_{1}-t$ approximates the instantaneous velocity at $t$. As $t_{1}$ approaches $t$, the average velocity is called the instantaneous velocity.\nThis is similar to approximating the slope of a tangent line by calculating the slope of a secant line. Mathematically, the instantaneous velocity denoted by $v_{\\text {inst }}$ is given by the following limit:\n\n$$\nv_{\\text {inst }}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{t_{1} \\rightarrow t} \\frac{s\\left(t_{1}\\right)-s(t)}{t_{1}-t} \\quad \\text { (Provide the limit exist) }\n$$\n\nFor convenient, if $t_{1}=t+\\delta t$, then as $t_{1} \\rightarrow t \\Rightarrow \\delta t \\rightarrow 0$, thus above equation becomes:\n\n$$\nv_{\\text {inst }}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{t_{t} \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{s(t+\\delta t)-s(t)}{\\delta t}\n$$\n\nIn other words, the instantaneous velocity is the derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time.\nExample 2 A particle moves along a line such that its position after $t$ hours is given by: $s(t)=4 t^{2}+2 t+1$ (in miles)\n(a) Find the average velocity over the interval $[2,5]$\n(b) Find the instantaneous velocity at $t=3$\n\nSolution (a) given position function $s(t)=4 t^{2}+2 t+1$, where $2 \\leq t \\leq 5$\nThe average velocity over the interval $2 \\leq t \\leq 5$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Average velocity }=v_{\\text {avg }} & =\\frac{s(5)-s(2)}{5-2}=\\frac{4(5)^{2}+2(5)+1-[4(2)^{2}+2(2)+1]}{3} \\\\\n& =\\frac{111-21}{3}=\\frac{90}{3}=30 \\mathrm{miles} / \\mathrm{hours}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(b) Instantaneous velocity can be found using the formula\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Instantaneous velocity }=\\lim _{\\delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{s(t+\\delta t)-s(t)}{\\delta t} \\\\\n& =\\lim _{\\delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{4(3+\\delta t)^{2}+2(3+\\delta t)+1-[4(3)^{2}+2(3)+1]}{\\delta t} \\\\\n& =\\lim _{\\delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{4\\left(9+6 \\delta t+\\delta t^{2}\\right)+6+2 \\delta t+1-43}{\\delta t} \\\\\n& =\\lim _{\\delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{36+24 \\delta t+4 \\delta t^{2}+6+2 \\delta t+1-43}{\\delta t} \\\\\n& =\\lim _{\\delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{43+26 \\delta t+4 \\delta t^{2}-43}{\\delta t}=\\lim _{\\delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{26 \\delta t+4 \\delta t^{2}}{\\delta t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n=\\lim _{\\delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\delta t(26+4 \\delta t)}{\\delta t}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{t t \\rightarrow 0}(26+4 \\delta t)=26\n$$\n\nThus, instantaneous velocity at $t=3$ is 26 miles/hour\n\n# 13.3 Process of Finding Derivative $f^{\\prime}(x)$ by Definition\n\n### 12.3.1 Notation of Derivative\n\nSeveral notations are used for derivatives. We have used the functional symbol $f^{\\prime}(x)$, for the derivative of $f$ at $x$. For the function $y=f(x)$.\n\n$$\ny+\\delta y=f(x+\\delta x)\n$$\n\nDividing both the sides of (iv) by $\\delta x$, we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}=\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}\n$$\n\nTaking limit of both the sides of (v) as $\\delta x \\rightarrow 0$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}=\\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x} \\\\\n& \\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x} \\text { is denoted by } \\frac{d y}{d x}, \\text { so (vi) is written as } \\frac{d y}{d x}=f^{\\prime}(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# Note\n\nThe symbol $\\frac{d y}{d x}$ is used for the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ and here it is not a quotient of $d y$ and $d x . \\frac{d y}{d x}$ is also denoted by $y^{\\prime}$.\n\nNow we write, in a table the notations for derivative of $y=f(x)$ used by different mathematicians:\n\n| Name of mathematician | Leibniz | Newton | Lagrange | Euler |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Notation used for derivative | $\\frac{d y}{d x}$ or $\\frac{d f}{d x}$ | $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)$ or $y^{\\prime \\prime}$ | $f^{\\prime}(x)$ | $D f(x)$ |\n\nIf we replace $x+\\delta x$ by $x$ and $x$ by $a$, then the expression $f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)$ becomes $f(x)-f(a)$ and the change $\\delta x$ in the independent variable, in this case, is $x-a$.\nSo, the expression $\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}$ is written as $\\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$\nTaking the limit of the expression (vii) when $x \\rightarrow a$, gives $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} \\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=f^{\\prime}(a)$.\nHere $f^{\\prime}(a)$ is called the derivative or gradient of $f$ at $x=a$.\n\n### 13.3.2 Finding $f^{\\prime}(x)$ by Definition of Derivative\n\nGiven a function $f$, then $f^{\\prime}(x)$ if it exists, can be found by the following four steps:\nStep I: Find $f(x+\\delta x)$\nStep II: Simplify $f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)$\nStep III: Divide $f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)$ by $\\delta x$ to get $\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}$ and simplify it.\nStep IV: Find $\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}$\nThe method of finding derivatives by this process is called differentiation by definition or by ab-initio or from first principle.\n\nExample 3 Find the derivative of the following functions by definition\n(a) $f(x)=c$\n(b) $f(x)=x^{2}$\n\nSolution\n(a) $f(x)=c$\n(i) $f(x+\\delta x)=c$\n(ii) $f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)=c-c=0$\n(iii)

$\\operatorname{Lim}_{k \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{k \\rightarrow 0}(2 x+\\delta x)=2 x$\ni.e., $\\quad f^{\\prime}(x)=2 x$\n\nExample 4 Find the derivative of $\\sqrt{x}$ at $x=a$ from first principle.\nSolution If $f(x)=\\sqrt{x}$, then\n(i) $f(x+\\delta x)=\\sqrt{x+\\delta x}$ and\n(ii) $f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)=\\sqrt{x+\\delta

Two of its foundational concepts of continuity and derivatives are deeply connected. While each concept has its own definition and application, understanding how they relate to each other is essential for solving real-world problems in mathematics.\nAs discussed in previous units, a function is continuous at a point if its graph has no breaks, jumps, or holes at that point. On the other hand, the derivative of a function at a point measures the instantaneous rate of change or equivalently, the slope of the tangent line at that point. However, this definition depends on the function being wellbehaved around the point. This leads to a well-known result:\nIf a function is differentiable at a point, it must also be continuous there. This means that differentiability implies continuity, but the reverse is not necessarily true. For example, consider the function $f(x)=|x|$, clearly this function is continuous at $x=0$ (see Figure 13.3). Now we check the differentiability of $f(x)=|x|$ at $x=0$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(x) & =|x| \\\\\nf(0) & =|0|=0 \\text { and } \\\\\nf(0+\\delta x) & =|0+\\delta x|=|\\delta x| \\\\\nf(0+\\delta x)-f(0) & =|\\delta x|-0 \\\\\nf(0+\\delta x)-f(0) & =|\\delta x| \\\\\n& =\\frac{|\\delta x|}{\\delta x}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\nf^{\\prime}(x)=\\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta x}\n$$\n\nThus $f^{\\prime}(x)=\\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta x}$\nBecause $|\\delta x|=\\delta x$ when $\\delta x>0$\nand $|\\delta x|=-\\delta x$ when $\\delta x<0$,\nFigure 13.3\nso, we consider one-sided limits\n$\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{|\\delta x|}{\\delta x}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta x}=1$ and $\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{|\\delta x|}{\\delta x}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{-\\delta x}{\\delta x}=-1$\nThe right hand and left hand limits are not equal, therefore, the $\\operatorname{Lim}_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta x}$ does not exist. This implies that derivative of $f$ at $x=0$ does not exist, and thus, there is no tangent line to the graph of $f$ at this point (see Figure 13.3). However, the derivative exists at all other points of $f$ i.e., it is 1 on the right side and -1 on the left side. A function can be continuous at a point but not necessarily differentiable there.\n\n# EXERCISE 13.1\n\n1. Find by definition, the derivatives w.r.t.

Henceforth, in all subsequent discussion, $f, g, h$ etc, all denote functions differentiable at $x$, unless stated otherwise.\n3.

Determine the marginal profit when $x=8$ units.\nSolution The marginal profit is the derivative of the profit function with respect to $x$.\n$P^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(100 x-5 x^{2}\\right)=100-10 x$\nNow, substitute $x=8: P^{\\prime}(8)=100-10(8)=20$\nSo, the marginal profit is 20 when 8 units are produced (in the given currency).\nMovement of Particles\nExample 13 A particle moves along a line according to the position function $s(t)=4 t^{3}-3 t^{2}+2 t$, where $s(t)$ is the position in metres and $t$ is the time in seconds. Find the velocity and acceleration at $t=2$ seconds.\nSolution Velocity is the derivative of the position function:\n\n$$\nv(t)=\\frac{d}{d t}\\left(4 t^{3}-3 t^{2}+2 t\\right)=12 t^{2}-6 t+2\n$$\n\nSubstitute $t=2$ :\n\n$$\nv(2)=12(2)^{2}-6(2)+2=48-12+2=38\n$$\n\nSo, the velocity at $t=2$ is $38 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.\nAcceleration is the derivative of the velocity function:\n\n$$\na(t)=\\frac{d}{d t}\\left(12 t^{2}-6 t+2\\right)=24 t-6\n$$\n\nSubstitute $t=2$\n\n$$\na(2)=24(2)-6=48-6=42\n$$\n\nSo, the acceleration at $t=2$ is $42 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$.\n\n# Financial Investments\n\nExample 14 A bank offers a compound interest rate on an investment, and the value of the investment after $t$ years is given by $V(t)=5000(1+0.04 t)^{2}$. Find the rate of change of the investment value after 10 years.\nSolution The rate of change of the investment is the derivative of $V(t)$ with respect to $t$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& V^{\\prime}(t)=\\frac{d}{d t}\\left(5000(1+0.04 t)^{2}\\right)=5000(2)(1+0.04 t)(0.04) \\\\\n& V^{\\prime}(t)=400(1+0.04 t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstitute $t=10$ :\n\n$$\nV^{\\prime}(10)=400(1+0.04 \\times 10)=400(1+0.40)=400 \\times 1.4=560\n$$\n\nSo, the investment is growing at a rate of Rs. 560 per year after 10 years.\n\n## Structural Stress\n\nExample 15 The stress on a beam under a varying load is modeled by $S(x)=500 x-2 x^{2}$, where $S(x)$ is the stress in pascals ( Pa ) and $x$ is the distance (in metres) from the beam's fixed end. Find the rate of change of stress at $x=5$ metres.\nSolution The rate of change of stress is the derivative of $S(x)$ with respect to $x$.\n\n$$\nS^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(500 x-2 x^{2}\\right)=500-6 x^{2}\n$$\n\nSubstitute $x=5$ :\n\n$$\nS^{\\prime}(5)=500-6(5)^{2}=500-6 \\times 25=500-150=350\n$$\n\nSo, the stress is increasing at a rate of 350 Pa per metre at $x=5$ metres.\n\n## EXERCISE 13.3\n\n1. A car's position at time $t$ is given by $s(t)=5 t^{2}-3 t^{2}+t$. Find the velocity by differentiating the position function with respect to time.\n2. Structural stress on a bridge is modeled by the function $S(x)=100-5 x^{2}$, where $x$ is the distance from the center of the bridge. Calculate the rate of change of stress at that point.\n\n3.

          "title": "Vectors in Space\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nIn this unit, we will look into the rectangular coordinate system in three-dimensional space and explore the fundamental mathematical operations involving vectors in space. We will begin by understanding the dot product (or scalar product) and the cross product (or vector product) of two vectors and learn about their geometric interpretation. Further, we emphasize their practical applications. For example, we will see how these concepts can be used to calculate the area of a triangle and the area of a parallelogram. Finally, we will explore the extensive use of vectors in three-dimensional space, particularly in physics, where they play an important role in determining forces, velocities, and other essential physical quantities. For example, determining the work done by a constant force when moving an object along a specified vector.\n\n### 14.1 Vectors (Recall)\n\nIn previous classes, we learned about two fundamental quantities: scalars and vectors. A scalar is a quantity that has only magnitude or size, such as mass, time, density, temperature, length, volume, speed, work etc. On the other hand, a vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction, for example displacement, velocity, acceleration, weight, force, momentum, electric and magnetic fields, etc.\nGeometrically, a vector is represented as a directed line segment $\\overrightarrow{A B}$ with $A$ as its initial point and $B$ as the terminal point.\nIn two-dimension $\\left(R^{2}\\right)$ a vector has components that can be represented by an ordered pair $[x, y]$ of real numbers. For the vector $\\underline{u}=[x, y], x$ and $y$ represent the components of $\\underline{u}$.\nAddition of Vectors: For any two vectors $\\underline{u}=\\left[x_{1}, y_{1}\\right]$ and $\\underline{y}=\\left[x_{2}, y_{2}\\right]$, we have\n\n$$\n\\underline{u}+\\underline{y}=\\left[x_{1}, y_{1}\\right]+\\left[x_{2}, y_{2}\\right]=\\left[x_{1}+x_{2}, y_{1}+y_{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nScalar Multiplication of a Vector: For $\\underline{u}=[x, y]$ and $a \\in R$, we have\n\n$$\na \\underline{u}=a[x, y]=[a x, a y]\n$$\n\nEqual Vectors: Two vectors $\\underline{u}=\\left[x_{1}, y_{1}\\right]$ and $\\underline{y}=\\left[x_{2}, y_{2}\\right]$ of $R^{2}$ are said to be equal\n\nif and only if they have the same components. That is, $\\left[x_{1}, y_{1}\\right]=\\left[x_{2}, y_{2}\\right]$ if and only if $x_{1}=x_{2}$ and $y_{1}=y_{2}$ and we write $\\underline{u}=\\underline{v}$\nIn other words, two vectors $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$ are said to be equal, if they have same magnitude and same direction.\nParallel Vectors: Two vectors are parallel if and only if they are non-zero scalar multiple of each other.\nFor example, vectors $\\overrightarrow{A B},-\\overrightarrow{A B}$ and $\\frac{3}{2} \\overrightarrow{A B}$ are parallel.\n\n# Magnitude of a Vector\n\nThe magnitude (or norm or length) of a vector in 2D represents the length of the vector from the origin to the point represented by the vector. For any vector $\\underline{u}=[x, y]$ in $R^{2}$, we define the magnitude, as the distance of the point $P(x, y)$ from the origin $O$.\n\nMagnitude of $\\overrightarrow{O P}=|\\overrightarrow{O P}|=|\\underline{u}|=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$\nNow, we will learn some mathematical operations involving vectors in three-dimensional space.\n\n### 14.1.1 Rectangular Coordinate System in Space\n\nIn space a rectangular coordinate system is constructed using three mutually orthogonal (perpendicular) axes, which have origin as their common point of intersection. When sketching figures, we follow the convention that the positive $x$-axis points towards the reader, the positive $y$-axis to the right and the positive $z$-axis points upwards.\nThese axes are also labeled in accordance with the righthand rule. The fingers of the right hand, pointing in the direction of the positive $x$-axis, curled images toward the positive $y$-axis, and the thumb will point in the direction of the positive $z$-axis. A point $P$ in space has three coordinates, one along $x$-axis, the second along $y$-axis and the third along $z$-axis. If the\nRight hand rule\n\n# Unit 44 Vectors in Space\n\ndirected distances along $x$-axis, $y$-axis and $z$-axis respectively are $a, b$ and $c$, then the point $P$ is written with a unique triple of real numbers as $P(a, b, c)$ (see figure).\n\n### 14.1.2 Concept of a Vector in Space\n\nThe set $R^{3}=\\{(x, y, z): x, y, z \\in R\\}$ is called 3-dimensional space. An element $(x, y, z)$ of $R^{3}$ represents a point $P(x, y, z)$, which is uniquely determined by its coordinates $x, y$ and $z$. Given a vector $\\underline{u}$ in space, there exists a unique point $P(x, y, z)$ in space such that the vector $\\overrightarrow{O P}$ is equal to $\\underline{u}$ (see figure). Now each element $(x, y, z) \\in R^{3}$ is associated with a unique ordered triple $(x, y, z)$, which represents the vector $\\underline{u}=\\overrightarrow{O P}=[x, y, z]$.\n\n### 14.1.3 Fundamental Mathematical Operations for Vectors in Space\n\nWe define addition and scalar multiplication in $R^{3}$ by:\n(i) Addition of Vectors: For any two vectors $\\underline{u}=[x, y, z]$ and $\\underline{y}=\\left[x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right]$ we have $\\underline{u}+\\underline{v}=[x, y, z]+\\left[x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right]=\\left[x+x^{\\prime}, y+y^{\\prime}, z+z^{\\prime}\\right]$\n(ii) Scalar Multiplication of a Vector: For $\\underline{u}=[x, y, z]$ and $a \\in R$, we have $a \\underline{u}=a[x, y, z]=[a x, a y, a z]$\nThe set of all ordered triples $[x, y, z]$ of real numbers, together with the rules of addition and scalar multiplication is called the set of vectors in $R^{3}$. For the vector $\\underline{u}=[x, y, z], x, y$ and $z$ are called the components of $\\underline{u}$. The definition of vectors in $R^{3}$ states that vector addition and scalar multiplication are to be carried out also for vectors in space just as for vectors in the plane. Similarly, we define in $R^{3}$ :\n(a) The negative of the vector $\\underline{u}=[x, y, z]$ as $-\\underline{u}=(-1) \\underline{u}=[-x,-y,-z]$\n(b) The difference of two vectors $\\underline{y}=\\left[x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right]$ and $\\underline{w}=\\left[x^{\\prime \\prime}, y^{\\prime \\prime}, z^{\\prime \\prime}\\right]$ as\n\n$$\n\\underline{v}-\\underline{w}=\\underline{v}+(-\\underline{w})=\\left[x^{\\prime}-x^{\\prime \\prime}, y^{\\prime}-y^{\\prime \\prime}, z^{\\prime}-z^{\\prime \\prime}\\right]\n$$\n\n(c) The zero vector as $O=[0,0,0]$\n(d) Equality of two vectors: Two vectors $\\underline{y}=\\left[x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right]$ and $\\underline{w}=\\left[x^{\\prime \\prime}, y^{\\prime \\prime}, z^{\\prime \\prime}\\right]$ are equal that is $\\underline{v}=\\underline{w}$ if and only if $x^{\\prime}=x^{\\prime \\prime}, y^{\\prime}=y^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $z^{\\prime}=z^{\\prime \\prime}$.\n(e) Position Vector\n\nFor any point $P(x, y, z)$ in $R^{3}$, a vector $\\underline{u}=[x, y, z]$ is represented by a directed line segment $\\overrightarrow{O P}$, whose initial point is at origin. Such vectors are called position vectors in $R^{3}$.\n\n# 14.1.4 Magnitude of a Vector in Space\n\nWe define the magnitude, norm, or length of a vector $\\underline{u}=[x, y, z]$ in space by the distance of the point $P(x, y, z)$ from the origin $O$.\n\n$$\n\\therefore \\quad \\overrightarrow{O P}=|u|=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}\n$$\n\nExample 1 For the vectors, $\\underline{u}=[1,-2,3], \\underline{y}=[2,1,3]$ and $\\underline{w}=[-1,4,0]$, find the following:\n(i) $\\underline{y}+\\underline{w}$\n(ii) $2 \\underline{w}$\n(iii) $|u|$\n(iv) $|\\underline{v}-2 \\underline{w}|$\n(v) $|2 \\underline{u}-\\underline{y}+3 \\underline{w}|$\n\nSolution (i) $\\underline{y}+\\underline{w}=[2-1,1+4,3+0]=[1,5,3]$\n(ii) $2 \\underline{w}=2[-1,4,0]=[-2,8,0]$\n(iii) $|u|=[1,-2,3]=\\sqrt{(1)^{2}+(-2)^{2}+(3)^{2}}=\\sqrt{1+4+9}=\\sqrt{14}$\n(iv) $|\\underline{v}-2 \\underline{w}|=|[2+2,1-8,3-0]|=|[4,-7,3]|$\n\n$$\n=\\sqrt{(4)^{2}+(-7)^{2}+(3)^{2}}=\\sqrt{16+49+9}=\\sqrt{74}\n$$\n\n(v) $|2 \\underline{u}-\\underline{y}+3 \\underline{w}|=|2[1,-2,3]-[2,1,3]+3[-1,4,0]|=|[2,-4,6]-[2,1,3]+[-3,12,0]|$\n\n$$\n=[-3,7,3]=\\sqrt{(-3)^{2}+(7)^{2}+(3)^{2}}=\\sqrt{9+49+9}=\\sqrt{67}\n$$\n\n### 14.1.5 Components of a Vector\n\nAs in plane, we introduce three special vectors $i=[1,0,0]$, $j=[0,1,0]$ and $k=[0,0,1]$ in $R^{3}$\n\nAs magnitude of $i=\\sqrt{1^{2}+0^{2}+0^{2}}=1$\nmagnitude of $j=\\sqrt{0^{2}+1^{2}+0^{2}}=1$ and\nmagnitude of $k=\\sqrt{0^{2}+0^{2}+1^{2}}=1$. So, $i, j$\nand $k$ are called unit vectors along $x$-axis, $y$-axis and $z$-axis respectively. Using the definition of addition and scalar multiplication, the vector $[x, y, z]$ can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\underline{u}=[x, y, z] & =[x, 0,0]+[0, y, 0]+[0,0, z] \\\\\n& =x[1,0,0]+y[0,1,0]+z[0,0,1]=x i+y j+z k\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, each vector $[x, y, z]$ in $R^{3}$ can be uniquely represented by $x i+y i+z k$.\n\n## Unit Vector\n\nA unit vector is defined as a vector whose magnitude is unity. In three-dimensional space the unit vector of the vector $\\underline{u}=x i+y j+z k$ is written as $\\hat{u}$ (read as $u$ hat) and\n\nis defined by\n\n$$\n\\hat{u}=\\frac{u}{|u|}=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}} i+\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}} j+\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}} k\n$$\n\nIn terms of unit vector $i, j$, and $k$, the sum $u+y$ of two vectors.\n$\\underline{u}=\\left[x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}\\right]$ and $y=\\left[x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}\\right]$ is written as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\underline{u}+\\underline{v} & =\\left[x_{1}+x_{2}, y_{1}+y_{2}, z_{1}+z_{2}\\right] \\\\\n& =\\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right) i+\\left(y_{1}+y_{2}\\right) j+\\left(z_{1}+z_{2}\\right) k\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 2 Find the unit vector of $\\underline{u}=2 i+5 j-k$.\nSolution Given vector $\\underline{u}=2 i+5 \\underline{j}-k$, to find the unit vector\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad|u|=\\sqrt{(2)^{2}+(5)^{2}+(-1)^{2}}=\\sqrt{30} \\\\\n& \\quad \\text { The unit vector is: } \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad \\hat{u}=\\frac{u}{|u|}=\\frac{2 i+5 j-k}{\\sqrt{30}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{30}}(2 i+5 j-k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, $\\hat{u}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{30}}(2 i+5 j-k)$ is the required unit vector.\nExample 3 If $\\underline{u}=2 i+3 j+k, \\underline{v}=4 i+6 j+2 k$ and $\\underline{w}=-6 i-9 j-3 k$, then show that $\\underline{u}, \\underline{v}$ and $\\underline{w}$ are parallel to each other.\nSolution $\\quad \\underline{v}=4 i+6 j+2 k=2(2 i+3 j+k)$\n\n$$\n\\therefore \\quad \\underline{v}=2 \\underline{u}\n$$\n\n$\\Rightarrow \\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$ are parallel vectors.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\underline{w}=-6 i-9 j-3 k \\\\\n& =-3(2 i+3 j+k) \\quad \\therefore \\quad \\underline{w}=-3 \\underline{u}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$\\Rightarrow \\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{w}$ are parallel vectors.\nHence $\\underline{u}, \\underline{v}$ and $\\underline{w}$ are parallel to each other.\n\n# 14.1.6 Properties of Vectors\n\nLet $\\underline{u}, \\underline{v}$ and $\\underline{w}$ be vectors in the plane or in space and let $a, b \\in R$, then they have the following properties:\n(i) $\\underline{u}+\\underline{v}=\\underline{v}+\\underline{u}$\n(Commutative property)\n(ii) $(\\underline{u}+\\underline{v})+\\underline{w}=\\underline{u}+(\\underline{v}+\\underline{w})$\n(Associative property)\n(iii) $\\underline{u}+\\underline{o}=\\underline{u}$\n(Additive Identity)\n(iv) $\\underline{u}+(-1) \\underline{u}=\\underline{u}-\\underline{u}=\\underline{o}$\n(Inverse for vector addition)\n(v) $a(\\underline{v}+\\underline{w})=a \\underline{v}+\\alpha \\underline{w}$\n(Distributive property)\n(vi) $a(b \\underline{u})=(a b) \\underline{u}$\n(Scalar multiplication)\n\nProof: (i) Since for any two real numbers $a, b \\in R, a+b=b+a$, it follows that for any two vectors $\\underline{u}=[x, y, z]$ and $\\underline{y}=\\left[x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right]$ in $R^{3}$, where components of $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{y}$ belong to $R$.\nWe have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\underline{u}+\\underline{y} & =[x, y, z]+\\left[x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right] \\\\\n& =\\left[x+x^{\\prime}, y+y^{\\prime}, z+z^{\\prime}\\right] \\\\\n& =\\left[x^{\\prime}+x, y^{\\prime}+y, z^{\\prime}+z\\right] \\quad \\because \\quad a+b=b+a \\\\\n& =\\left[x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right]+[x, y, z] \\\\\n& =\\underline{y}+\\underline{u}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo, addition of vectors in $R^{3}$ is commutative.\n(ii) Since for any three real numbers $a, b, c \\in R,(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$, it follows that for any three vectors, $\\underline{u}=[x, y, z], \\underline{y}=\\left[x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right]$ and $\\underline{w}=\\left[x^{\\prime \\prime}, y^{\\prime \\prime}, z^{\\prime \\prime}\\right]$ in $R^{3}$.

This algebraic operation plays a fundamental role for understanding various physical and mathematical real-life situation. Unlike the multiplication of numbers, product of vector can be performed in two distinct ways. The two primary types of vector multiplication are the dot product and the cross product. The dot product is a scalar number while cross product is a vector quantity.\n\n# 14.2 Dot or Scalar Product\n\n14.2.1 Dot or Scalax Product of Two Vectors and Its Geometrical Interpretation We shall now consider products of two vectors that originated in the study of physics and engineering. The concept of angle between two vectors is expressed in terms of a scalar product of two vectors.\n\nDefinition 1: Let two non-zero vectors $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$, in the plane or in space, have same initial point. The dot product of $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$, written as $\\underline{u} \\cdot \\underline{v}$, is defined by\n\n$$\n\\underline{u} \\cdot \\underline{v}=|\\underline{u}||\\underline{v}| \\cos 0\n$$\n\nWhere $\\theta$ in the angle between $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$ and $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$\n\n# Definition 2:\n\n(a) If $\\underline{u}=a_{1} \\underline{i}+\\underline{b}_{1} \\underline{j}$ and $\\underline{v}=a_{2} \\underline{i}+\\underline{b}_{2} \\underline{j}$ are two non-zero vectors in the plane.

The dot product $\\underline{u} \\cdot \\underline{v}$ is defined by\n\n$$\n\\underline{u} \\cdot \\underline{v}=a_{1} a_{2}+b_{1} b_{2}+c_{1} c_{2}\n$$\n\nNote The dot product is also referred as the scalar product or the inner product.\nExample 5 Prove the equivalence of above two definitions of dot product of two vectors:\n(i) If $\\underline{v}=\\left[x_{1}, y_{1}\\right]$ and $\\underline{w}=\\left[x_{2}, y_{2}\\right]$ are two vectors in the plane, then $\\underline{v} \\underline{w}=x_{1} x_{2}+y_{1} y_{2}$\n(ii) If $\\underline{v}$ and $\\underline{w}$ are two non-zero vectors in the plane, then $\\underline{v} \\cdot \\underline{w}=|\\underline{v}||\\underline{w}| \\cos \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\underline{v}$ and $\\underline{w}$ and $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$.\nProof: Let $\\underline{v}$ and $\\underline{w}$ be the sides of a triangle then the third side opposite to the angle $\\theta$, has length $|\\underline{v}-\\underline{w}|$ By law of cosines,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n|\\underline{v}-\\underline{w}|^{2} & =|\\underline{v}|^{2}+|\\underline{w}|^{2}-2|\\underline{v}||\\underline{w}| \\cos \\theta \\\\\n\\text { if } \\quad \\underline{v} & =\\left[x_{1}, y_{1}\\right] \\text { and } \\underline{w}=\\left[x_{2}, y_{2}\\right] \\text {, then } \\\\\n\\underline{v}-\\underline{w} & =\\left[x_{1}-x_{2}, y_{1}-y_{2}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe law of cosine: $a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c \\cos a$\n\nSo, equation (1) becomes:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(y_{1}-y_{2}\\right)^{2}=x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}-2|\\underline{v}||\\underline{w}| \\cos \\theta \\\\\n& -2 x_{1} x_{2}-2 y_{1} y_{2}=-2|\\underline{v}||\\underline{w}| \\cos \\theta \\\\\n& x_{1} x_{2}+y_{1} y_{2}=|\\underline{v}||\\underline{w}| \\cos \\theta=\\underline{v} \\cdot \\underline{w}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# 14.2.2 Deduction of the Important Results\n\nBy applying the definition of dot product to unit vectors $i, j$ and $k$, we have\n(a) $i . i=|i| i \\mid \\cos 0^{\\circ}=1$\n$j . j=|j||j \\cos 0^{\\circ}=1$\n$k . k=|k||k \\cos 0^{\\circ}=1$\n(b) $i . j=|i||j \\cos 90^{\\circ}=0$\n$j . k=|j||k \\cos 90^{\\circ}=0$\n$k . i=|k||i \\cos 90^{\\circ}=0$\n\n### 14.2.3 Projection of a Vector along Another Vector\n\nIn many physical applications, it is required to know \"how much\" of a vector is applied along a given direction. For this purpose, we find the projection of one vector along the other vector.\nLet $\\overrightarrow{O A}=\\underline{u}$ and $\\overrightarrow{O B}=\\underline{v}$\nLet $\\theta$ be the angle between them, such that $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$.\nDraw $\\overrightarrow{B M} \\perp \\overrightarrow{O A}$. Then $\\overrightarrow{O M}$ is called the projection of $\\underline{v}$ along $\\underline{u}$.\nFrom the figure: $\\frac{\\overrightarrow{O M}}{\\overrightarrow{O B}}=\\cos \\theta$, that is,\n\n$$\n\\overrightarrow{O M}=|\\overrightarrow{O B}| \\cos \\theta=|\\underline{v}| \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\nNow, $u \\cdot \\underline{v}=|\\underline{u}||\\underline{v}| \\cos \\theta=|\\underline{u}|(|\\underline{v}| \\cos \\theta)=|\\underline{u}|(\\overrightarrow{O M})$\n$=$ (magnitude of $\\underline{u}$ ). (projection of $\\underline{v}$ along $\\underline{u}$ )\nThus, geometrically, the dot product of two vectors represents the product of the magnitude of one vector and the projection of the other vector onto it. In other words, the dot product of two vectors shows how much one vector extends in the direction of another.\n\nNow, by definition, $\\quad \\cos \\theta=\\frac{u \\cdot

components\n\nLet $\\underline{u}=a_{1} \\underline{i}+b_{1} \\underline{j}+c_{1} \\underline{k}$ and $\\underline{v}=a_{2} \\underline{i}+b_{2} \\underline{j}+c_{2} \\underline{k}$ be two non-zero vectors.\nFrom distributive law we can write:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\therefore \\quad \\underline{u} \\cdot \\underline{v}= & \\left(a_{1} i+b_{1} \\underline{j}+c_{1} \\underline{k}\\right)

\\underline{i}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence the dot product of two vectors is the sum of the product of their corresponding components.\nExample 6 Show that the components of a vector are the projections of that vector along $i, j$ and $k$ respectively.\nProof: Let $\\underline{v}=a \\underline{i}+b \\underline{j}+c \\underline{k}$, then\nProjection of $\\underline{v}$ along

Find the work done.\n\n# 14.3 Cross Product or Vector Product\n\n### 14.3.1 The Cross Product or Vector Product of Two Vectors and its Geometrical Interpretation\n\nOne of the key multiplication operations involving vectors in space is the cross product. Unlike the dot product, which results is a scalar, the cross product of two vectors yields a vector quantity. The vector product of two vectors is widely used in Physics, particularly in fields of mechanics and electricity. It is only defined for vectors in space. Let $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$ be two non-zero vectors. The cross or vector product of $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$ gives a\n\nvector that is perpendicular to both the vectors $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$, written as $\\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v}$, is defined by\n\n$$\n\\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v}=(\\|\\underline{u}\\| \\mid \\underline{v} \\mid \\sin \\theta) \\underline{n}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the vectors, such that $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$ and $\\underline{n}$ is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$ with direction given by the right-hand rule.\nFigure (a)\nRight hand\nRight hand rule\nFigure (b)\n(i) If the fingers of the right hand point along the vector $\\underline{u}$ and then curl towards the vector $\\underline{v}$, then the thumb will give the direction of $\\underline{n}$ which is $\\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v}$. It is shown in the figure (a).\n(ii) In figure (b), the right hand rule shows the direction of $\\underline{v} \\times \\underline{u}$.\n\n# 14.3.2 Parallel Vectors\n\nIf $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$ are parallel vectors, then $(\\theta=0 \\Rightarrow \\sin 0=0)$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v}=\\|\\underline{u}\\| \\mid \\underline{v}\\| \\sin \\theta \\underline{n} \\\\\n& \\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v}=0 \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\mid \\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAnd if $\\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v}=0$, then either $\\sin \\theta=0 \\quad$ or $\\quad\\|\\underline{u}\\|=0 \\quad$ or $\\quad\\|\\underline{v}\\|=0$\n(i) If $\\sin \\theta=0 \\Rightarrow \\theta=0^{\\circ}$ or $180^{\\circ}$. Which shows that the vectors $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$ are parallel.\n(ii) If $\\underline{u}=\\underline{0}$ or $\\underline{v}=\\underline{0}$, then since the zero vector has no specific direction, we adopt the convention that the zero vector is parallel to every vector.\n\n## Note: Zero vector is both parallel and perpendicular to every vector. This apparent contradiction will cause no trouble, since the angle between two vectors is never applied when one of them is zero vector.\n\n### 14.3.3 Derivation of Useful Results of Cross Products\n\nBy applying the definition of cross product to unit vectors $i, j$ and $k$, we have:\n(a) $\\underline{i} \\times \\underline{i}=\\|\\underline{i}\\| \\mid i\\left\\|\\sin 0^{\\circ}

following properties:\n(i) $\\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v}=\\underline{0}$ if $\\underline{u}=\\underline{0}$ or $\\underline{v}=\\underline{0}$\n(ii) $\\underline{u} \\times

In three-dimensional space, it provides a significant role in calculating the volume of geometric shapes such as parallelepipeds and tetrahedrons, defined by three vectors, which we will learn later in this chapter. Additionally, it plays as a vital tool for determining the coplanarity of vectors, providing a condition to verify whether three vectors lie within the same plane.\nThere are two types of triple product of vectors:\n(a) Scalar Triple Product: $\\underline{u} \\cdot(\\underline{v} \\times \\underline{w})$\n(b) Vector Triple Product: $\\underline{u} \\times(\\underline{v} \\times \\underline{w})$\n\nIn this section we shall study the scalar triple product only.\nLet $\\underline{u}, \\underline{v}$ and $\\underline{w}$ be three non-zero vectors\nThe scalar triple product of

$\\underline{w}$ as its conterminous edges.\nAs it is seen from the formula that:\n\nHence, (i) $\\backslash[\\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v}]:=\\operatorname{area}$ of the parallelogram with two adjacent sides $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}$.\n(ii) $|\\underline{w}| \\cos \\theta=$ height of the parallelepiped\n$(\\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v}) \\cdot \\underline{w}=|\\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v}||\\underline{w}| \\cos \\theta=$ (Area of Parallelogram) (height)\n$=$ Volume of the parallelepiped\nSimilarly, be taking the base plane formed by $\\underline{v}$ and $\\underline{w}$, we have\nThe volume of the parallelepiped $=(\\underline{v} \\times \\underline{w}) \\cdot \\underline{u}$\nAnd by taking the base plane formed by $\\underline{w}$ and $\\underline{u}$, we have\nThe volume of the parallelepiped $=(\\underline{w} \\times \\underline{u}) \\cdot \\underline{v}$\nSo, we have: $(\\underline{u} \\times \\underline{v})

\\underline{w}$ as edges)\n## Nota\n\nAs volume is always positive so ignore negative sign if $(u \\times v) \\cdot w$ is negative.\n\nThus, volume of tetrahedron $=\\frac{1}{6}(\\underline{u} \\times

for Coplanarity of Three Vectors\n\nVectors are coplanar if they lie in the same plane or can be combined in the same plane.\nConsider the three coplanar vectors $u, v$ and $w$ in a plane as shown in a figure.\nThe cross product $v \\times w$ gives a vector that is perpendicular to both the vectors yand $w$, As $u, v$ and $w$ are coplanar, so\n$y \\times w$ is also perpendicular to $u$\nThus, the dot product of $u$ and $v \\times w$ is zero. i.e.,\n\n$$\nu \\cdot(v \\times w)=0 \\quad \\because \\text { If vectors } a \\text { and } b \\text { are perpndicular then } a \\cdot b=0\n$$\n\nThus, we conclude that if the three vectors $u, v$ and $w$ are coplanar then their scalar triple product is zero.\n\n## Properties of Scalar Triple Product\n\n1. If $u, v$ and $w$ are coplanar, then the volume of the parallelepiped so formed is zero that is $(u \\times v) \\cdot w=0$ and hence the vectors $u, v, w$ are coplanar $\\Leftrightarrow(u \\times v) \\cdot w=0$\n2. If any two vectors of scalar triple product are equal, then its value is zero i.e., $[u u w]=[u v v]=[u w w]=0$\nExample 27 Prove that four points\n$A(-3,5,-4), B(-1,1,1), C(-1,2,2)$ and $D(-3,4,-5)$ are coplanar.\nProof: $\\quad \\overrightarrow{A B}=\\overrightarrow{O B}-\\overrightarrow{O A}=(-1+3) \\underline{i}+(1-5) \\underline{j}+(1+4) \\underline{k}=2 \\underline{i}-4 \\underline{j}+5 \\underline{k}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\overrightarrow{A C}=\\overrightarrow{O C}-\\overrightarrow{O A}=(-1+3) \\underline{i}+(2-5) \\underline{j}+(2+4) \\underline{k}=2 \\underline{i}-3 \\underline{j}+6 \\underline{k} \\\\\n& \\overrightarrow{A D}=\\overrightarrow{O D}-\\overrightarrow{O A}=(-3+3) i+(4-5) j+(-5+4) k=0 i-j-k=-j-k\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nVolume of the parallelepiped formed $\\overrightarrow{A B}, \\overrightarrow{A C}$ and $\\overrightarrow{A D}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\overrightarrow{[A B A C A D]}=\\left|\\begin{array}{rrr}\n2 & -4 & 5 \\\\\n2 & -3 & 6 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -1\n\\end{array}\\right|=2(3+6)+4(-2-0)+5(-2-0) \\\\\n& =18-8-10 \\\\\n& =0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs the volume is zero, so the points $A, B, C$ and $D$ are coplaner.\nExample 28 Find the value of $\\alpha$, so that $\\alpha i+j, i+j+3 k$ and $2 i+j-2 k$ are coplanar.\nSolution Let $\\underline{u}=\\alpha i+j+0 k, \\underline{v}=i+j+3 k$ and $\\underline{w}=2 i+j-2 k$ be three given vectors. Scalar triple product of given vectors is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& {[\\underline{u} \\underline{v} \\underline{w}]=\\left|\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\alpha & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 1 & -2\n\\end{array}\\right|} \\\\\n& =\\alpha(-2-3)-1(-2-6)+0(1-2) \\\\\n& =-5 \\alpha+8\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe vectors will be coplanar if $-5 \\alpha+8-0 \\Rightarrow \\alpha=\\frac{8}{5}$\n\n# 14.4.5 Applications of Vectors in Real World\n\nExample 29 A plumber exerts a force of 30 pounds along the negative $y$-axis on a lever connected to a machine. The pivot point of the lever is at the origin $(0,0,0)$, and the force is applied at the point ( $1.2 \\mathrm{ft}, 0.5 \\mathrm{ft}, 0 \\mathrm{ft}$ ). Determine the torque produced by this force about the pivot point.\nSolution The position vector $r$ from the origin to the point $(1.2,0.5,0)$ is given by $r=1.2 i+0.5 j+0 k$\n\nThe force $\\vec{F}$ is exerted downward along negative $y$-axis with a magnitude of 30 pounds is\n\n$$\n\\underline{F}=0 i-30 j+0 k\n$$\n\nTorque $\\tau$ produced by the force $=r \\times \\underline{F}$\nUsing determinant formula of cross product\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\underline{\\tau} & =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}\ni & j & k \\\\\n1.2 & 0.5 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -30 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right| \\\\\n& =0 i-0 j-36 k \\\\\n\\underline{\\tau} & =-36 k \\text { pound-feet }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the torque is 36 feet-pounds in the negative $z$-direction\nExample 30 During a building construction, a crane exerts a force to pull a concrete block, represented by the vector $\\underline{F}=[4500,3300,2140]$ Newton. Each component corresponds to the force exerted along the $x, y$, and $z$ axes, respectively. What is the magnitude of this force?\nSolution Using the formula for the magnitude of a vector in three-dimensional space\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n|\\underline{F}| & =\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}} \\\\\n& =\\sqrt{4500^{2}+3300^{2}+2140^{2}} \\\\\n& =\\sqrt{20250000+10890000+4579600} \\\\\n& =\\sqrt{35719600} \\\\\n& =5976.59\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the force exerted by the crane is approximately 5976.59 Newton.\nExample 11 The components of $\\underline{u}=300 \\underline{i}+250 \\underline{j}+180 \\underline{k}$ represent the respective number of jackets, shoes, and handbags sold at a store. The components of $\\underline{y}=3500 \\underline{i}+4200 \\underline{j}+6840 \\underline{k}$ represent the respective prices (in rupees) per unit for each product. Find $\\underline{u} \\cdot \\underline{v}$ and explain what the result tells us in real life.\nSolution The dot product of $\\underline{u}$ and $\\underline{v}=\\underline{u} \\cdot \\underline{v}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =(300 \\underline{i}+250 \\underline{j}+180 \\underline{k}) \\cdot(3500 \\underline{i}+4200 \\underline{j}+6840 \\underline{k}) \\\\\n& =1,050,000+1,050,000+1,231,200 \\\\\n& =3,331,200\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe result $\\underline{u} \\cdot \\underline{v}=3,331,200$ tells us that total revenue generated from selling all the three product is Rs. 3,331,200.\n\n# EXERCISE 14.4\n\n1.

          "title": "FUNCTIONS AND LIMITS\n\n# 1.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nFunctions are important tools by which we describe the real world in mathematical terms. They are used to explain the relationship between variable quantities and hence play a central role in the study of calculus.\n\n## 1.1.1 Concept of Function\n\nThe term function was recognized by a German Mathematician Leibniz (1646 - 1716) to describe the dependence of one quantity on another. The following examples illustrate how this term is used:\n\n- (i) The area \"A\" of a square depends on one of its sides \"x\" by the formula $$A = x^2$$, so we say that $$A$$ is a function of $$x$$.\n- (ii) The volume \"V\" of a sphere depends on its radius \"r\" by the formula $$V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$$, so we say that $$V$$ is a function of $$r$$.\n\nA function is a rule or correspondence, relating two sets in such a way that each element in the first set corresponds to one and only one element in the second set. Thus in, (i) above, a square of a given side has only one area. And in, (ii) above, a sphere of a given radius has only one volume. Now we have a formal definition:\n\n## 1.1.2 Definition (Function - Domain - Range)\n\nA Function $$f$$ from a set $$X$$ to a set $$Y$$ is a rule or a correspondence that assigns to each element $$x$$ in $$X$$ a unique element $$y$$ in $$Y$$. The set $$X$$ is called the domain of $$f$$.\n\nThe set of corresponding elements $$y$$ in $$Y$$ is called the range of $$f$$.\n\nUnless stated to the contrary, we shall assume hereafter that the set $$X$$ and $$Y$$ consist of real numbers.\n\n## 1.1.3 Notation and Value of a Function\n\nIf a variable $$y$$ depends on a variable $$x$$ in such a way that each value of $$x$$ determines exactly one value of $$y$$, then we say that $$y$$ is a function of $$x$$.\n\nSwiss mathematician Euler (1707-1783) invented a symbolic way to write the statement $$y$$ is a function of $$x$$ as $$y = f(x)$$, which is read as $$y$$ is equal to $$f$$ of $$x$$.\n\n**Note:** Functions are often denoted by the letters such as $$f, g, h, x, o, u$$ and so on.\n\nA function can be thought as a computing machine $$f$$ that takes an input $$x$$, operates on it in some way, and produces exactly one output $$f(x)$$. This output $$f(x)$$ is called the value of $$f$$ at $$x$$ or image of $$x$$ under $$f$$. The output $$f(x)$$ is denoted by a single letter, say $$y$$, and we write $$y = f(x)$$.\n\nThe variable $$x$$ is called the independent variable of $$f$$, and the variable $$y$$ is called the dependent variable of $$f$$. For now onward we shall only consider the function in which the variables are real numbers and we say that $$f$$ is a real valued function of real numbers.\n\n**Example 1:** Given $$f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x - 1$$, find\n\n- (i) $$f(0)$$\n- (ii) $$f(1)$$\n- (iii) $$f(-2)$$\n- (iv) $$f(1 + x)$$\n- (v) $$f(1/x), x \\neq 0$$\n\n**Solution:** $$f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x - 1$$\n\n- (i) $$f(0) = 0 - 0 + 0 - 1 = -1$$\n- (ii) $$f(1) = (1)^3 - 2(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = 1 - 2 + 4 - 1 = 2$$\n- (iii) $$f(-2) = (-2)^2 - 2(-2)^2 + 4(-2) - 1 = -8 - 8 - 8 - 1 = -2.5$$\n- (iv) $$f(1 + x) = (1 + x)^3 - 2(1 + x)^2 + 4(1 + x) - 1 = 1 + 3x + 3x^2 + x^3 - 2 - 4x - 2x^2 + 4 + 4x - 1 = x^3 + x^2 + 3x + 2$$\n\n- (iv) *f*(1/*x*) = (1/*x*)² - 2(1/*x*)² + 4(1/*x*) - 1 = $$\\frac{1}{x^2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{x^2} + \\frac{4}{x} \\cdot 1, x \\neq 0$$\n\n**Example 2:** Let *f*(*x*) = *x*². Find the domain and range of *f*.\n\n**Solution:** *f*(*x*) is defined for every real number *x*. Further for every real number *x*, *f*(*x*) = *x*² is a non-negative real number. So\n\n> Domain *f* = Set of all real numbers. Range *f* = Set of all non-negative real numbers.\n\n**Example 3:** Let *f*(*x*) = $$\\frac{x}{x^2 - 4}$$. Find the domain and range of *f*.\n\n**Solution:** At *x* = 2 and *x* = -2, *f*(*x*) = $$\\frac{x}{x^2 - 4}$$ is not defined. So\n\nDomain *f* = Set of all real numbers except -2 and 2. Range *f* = Set of all real numbers.\n\n**Example 4:** Let *f*(*x*) = $$\\sqrt{x^2 - 9}$$. Find the domain and range of *f*.\n\n**Solution:** We see that if *x* is in the interval -3 < *x* < 3, a square root of a negative number is obtained. Hence no real number *y* = $$\\sqrt{x^2 - 9}$$ exists. So\n\n> Domain *f* = (*x* ∈ *R* : |*x*| ≥ 3) = (-∞, -3] ∪ [3, + ∞) Range *f* = set of all positive real numbers = (0, + ∞)\n\n### 1.1.4 Graphs of Algebraic functions\n\nIf *f* is a real-valued function of real numbers, then the graph of *f* in the *xy*-plane is defined to be the graph of the equation *y* = *f*(*x*).\n\nThe graph of a function *f* is the set of points {(*x*, *y*) | *y* = *f*(*x*)}, *x* is in the domain of *f* in the Cartesian plane for which (*x*, *y*) is an ordered pair of *f*. The graph provides a visual technique for determining whether the set of points represents a function or not. If a vertical line intersects a graph in more than one point, it is not the graph of a function.\n\nExplanation is given in the figure.\n\n### **Method to draw the graph:**\n\nTo draw the graph of *y* = *f*(*x*), we give arbitrary values of our choice to *x* and find the corresponding values of *y*. In this way we get ordered pairs (*x*, *y*, *y*₁), (*x*, *y*₂), (*x*, *y*₃), etc. These ordered pairs represent points of the graph in the Cartesian plane. We add these points and join them together to get the graph of the function.\n\n**Example 5:** Find the domain and range of the function *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1 and draw its graph.\n\n**Solution:** Here *y* = *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1\n\nWe see that *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1 is defined for every real number. Further, for every real number *x*, *y* = *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1 is a non-negative real number.\n\n> Hence Domain *f* = set of all real numbers\n\nand Range *f* = set of all non-negative real numbers except the points 0 ≤ *y* < 1.\n\nFor graph of *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1, we assign some values to *x* from its domain and find the corresponding values in the range *f* as shown in the table:\n\n|  *x* | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  *y* = *f*(*x*) | 10 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 10  |\n\nPlotting the points (*x*, *y*) and joining them with a smooth curve, we get the graph of the function *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 1, which is shown in the figure.\n\n### **1.1.5 Graph of Functions Defined Piece-wise.**\n\nWhen the function *f* is defined by two rules, we draw the graphs of two functions as explained in the following example:\n\n**Example 7:** Find the domain and range of the function defined by:\n\n$$f(x) = \\begin{cases} x & \\text{when } 0 \\leq x \\leq 1 \\ x - 1 & \\text{when } 1 < x \\leq 2 \\end{cases} \\quad \\text{also draw its graph.}$$\n\n**Solution:** Here domain *f* = [0, 1] ∪ [1, 2] = [0, 2]. This function is composed of the following two functions:\n\n(i) *f(x)* = *x* when 0 ≤ *x* ≤ 1\n\n(ii) *f(x)* = *x* − 1, when 1 < *x* ≤ 2\n\nTo find the table of values of *x* and *y* = *f(x)* in each case, we take suitable values to *x* in the domain *f*. Thus\n\n|  Table for *y* = *f(x)* = *x* |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  *x* | 0 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  *y* = *f(x)* | 0 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |\n\nPlotting the points (*x*, *y*) and joining them we get two straight lines as shown in the figure. This is the graph of the given function.\n\n# **1.2 TYPES OF FUNCTIONS**\n\nSome important types of functions are given below:\n\n### **1.2.1 Algebraic Functions**\n\nAlgebraic functions are those functions which are defined by algebraic expressions. We classify algebraic functions as follows:\n\n*version: 1.1*\n\n### **(i) Polynomial Function**\n\nA function *P* of the form *P(x)* = *a_{n} x^{n}* + *a_{n-1} x^{n-1}* + *a_{n-2} x^{n-2}* + .... + *a_{2} x^{2}* + *a_{1} x + a_{0}* for all *x*, where the coefficient *a_{n}*, *a_{n-1}*, *a_{n-2}*, .... , *a_{2}*, *a_{1}*, *a_{0}* are real numbers and the exponents are non-negative integers, is called a **polynomial function**.\n\nThe domain and range of *P(x)* are, in general, subsets of real numbers.\n\nIf *a_{n}* ≠ 0, then *P(x)* is called a polynomial function of degree *n* and *a_{n}* is the leading coefficient of *P(x)*.\n\nFor example, *P(x)* = 2*x^{4}* − 3*x^{3}* + 2*x* − 1 is a **polynomial function** of degree 4 with leading coefficient 2.\n\n### **(ii) Linear Function**\n\nIf the degree of a polynomial function is 1, then it is called a **linear function**. A linear function is of the form: *f(x)* = *ax* + *b* (*a* ≠ 0), *a*, *b* are real numbers.\n\nFor example *f(x)* = 3*x* + 4 or *y* = 3*x* + 4 is a **linear function**. Its domain and range are the set of real numbers.\n\n### **(iii) Identity Function**\n\nFor any set *X*, a function *I* : *X* → *X* of the form *I(x)* = *x* ∀ *x* ∈ *X*, is called an **identity function**. Its domain and range is the set *X* itself. In particular, if *X* = *R*, then *I(x)* = *x*, for all *x* ∈ *R*, is the identity function.\n\n### **(iv) Constant Function**\n\nLet *X* and *Y* be sets of real numbers. A function *C* : *X* → *Y* defined by *C(x)* = *a*, ∀ *x* ∈ *X*, *a* ∈ *Y* and fixed, is called a **constant function**.\n\nFor example, *C* : *R* → *R* defined by *C(x)* = 2, ∀ *x* ∈ *R* is a constant function.\n\n### **(v) Rational Function**\n\nA function *R(x)* of the form *Q(x) = 0*, where both *P(x)* and *Q(x)* are polynomial functions and *Q(x)* ≠ 0, is called a **rational function**.\n\nThe domain of a rational function *R(x)* is the set of all real numbers *x* for which *Q(x)* ≠ 0.\n\n### **1.2.2 Trigonometric Functions**\n\nWe denote and define *trigonometric functions* as follows:\n\n(i) $y=\\sin x$, Domain $=R$, Range $-1 \\leq y \\leq 1$.\n(ii) $y=\\cos x$, Domain $=R$, Range $-1 \\leq y \\leq 1$.\n(iii) $y=\\tan x$, Domain $=(x: x \\in R$ and $x=(2 n+1) \\frac{\\pi}{2}, n$ an integer), Range $=R$\n(iv) $y=\\cot x$, Domain $=(x: x \\in R$ and $x \\neq n \\pi, n$ an integer), Range $=R$\n(v) $y=\\sec x$, Domain $=(x: x \\in R$ and $x \\neq(2 n+1) \\frac{\\pi}{2}, n$ an integer), Range $=R$\n(vi) $y=\\csc x$, Domain $=(x: x \\in R$ and $x \\neq n \\pi, n$ an integer), Range $=y \\geq 1, y \\leq-1$\n\n### 1.2.3 Inverse Trigonometric Functions\n\nWe denote and define inverse trigonometric functions as follows:\n(i) $y=\\sin ^{-1} x \\Leftrightarrow x=\\sin y$, where $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\leq y \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2},-1 \\leq x \\leq 1$\n(ii) $y=\\cos ^{-1} x \\Leftrightarrow x=\\cos y$, where $0 \\leq y \\leq \\pi,-1 \\leq x \\leq 1$\n(iii) $y=\\tan ^{-1} x \\Leftrightarrow x=\\tan y$, where $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<y<\\frac{\\pi}{2},-\\infty<x<\\infty$\n\n### 1.2.4 Exponential Function\n\nA function, in which the variable appears as exponent (power), is called an exponential function. The functions, $y=e^{a x}, y=e^{x}, y=2^{x}=$ $e^{a \\cdot x-2}$, etc are exponential functions of $x$.\n\n### 1.2.5 Logarithmic Function\n\nIf $x=a^{x}$, then $y=\\log _{a} x$, where $a>0, a \\neq 1$ is called Logarithmic Function of $x$.\n(i) If $a=10$, then we have $\\log _{10} x$ (written as $\\lg x$ ) which is known as the common logarithm of $x$.\n(ii) If $a=e$, then we have $\\log _{e} x$ (written as $\\ln x$ ) which is known as the natural logarithm of $x$.\n\n### 1.2.6 Hyperbolic Functions\n\n(i) $\\sinh x=\\frac{1}{a}\\left(e^{a}-e^{-a}\\right)$ is called hyperbolic sine function. Its domain and range are the set of all real numbers.\n(ii) $\\cosh x=\\frac{1}{a}\\left(e^{a}+e^{-a}\\right)$ is called hyperbolic cosine function. Its domain is the set of all real numbers and the range is the set of all numbers in the interval $[1,+\\infty)$\n(iii) The remaining four hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the hyperbolic sine and the hyperbolic cosine function as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\tanh x=\\frac{\\sinh x}{\\cosh x}=\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{e^{x}+e^{-x}} \\quad \\operatorname{sech} x=\\frac{1}{\\cosh x} \\quad \\frac{2}{e^{x}+e^{-x}} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{coth} x=\\frac{\\cosh x}{\\sinh x}=\\frac{e^{x}+e^{-x}}{e^{x}-e^{-x}} \\quad \\operatorname{csch} x=\\frac{1}{\\sinh x} \\quad \\frac{2}{e^{x}-e^{-x}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe hyperbolic functions have same properties that resemble to those of trigonometric functions.\n\n### 1.2.7 Inverse Hyperbolic Functions\n\nThe inverse hyperbolic functions are expressed in terms of natural logarithms and we shall study them in higher classes.\n(i) $\\quad \\sinh ^{-1} x=\\ln \\left(x+\\sqrt{x^{2}+1}\\right)$, for all $x \\quad$ (iv) $\\operatorname{coth}^{-1} x=\\frac{1}{x} \\ln \\left(\\frac{x+1}{x-1}\\right),|x|<1$\n(ii) $\\cosh ^{-1} x=\\ln \\left(x+\\sqrt{x^{2}-1}\\right) x \\geq 1 \\quad$ (v) $\\operatorname{sech}^{-1} x=\\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{x}\\right), 0<x \\leq 1$\n(iii) $\\tanh ^{-1} x=\\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right),|x|<1 \\quad$ (vi) $\\operatorname{csch}^{-1} x=\\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{\\sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{|x|}\\right), x \\neq 0$\n\n### 1.2.8 Explicit Function\n\nIf $y$ is easily expressed in terms of the independent variable $x$, then $y$ is called an explicit function of $x$. For example\n(i) $y=x^{2}+2 x-1 \\quad$ (ii) $y=\\sqrt{x-1}$ are explicit functions of $x$.\n\nSymbolically it can be written as $y=f(x)$.\n\n### 1.2.9 Implicit Function\n\nIf $x$ and $y$ are so mixed up and $y$ cannot be expressed in terms of the independent variable $x$, then $y$ is called an implicit function of $x$. For example,\n(i) $x^{2}+x y+y^{2}=2$\n(ii) $\\frac{x y^{2}-y+9}{x y}=1$ are implicit functions of $x$ and $y$.\n\nSymbolically it is written as $f(x, y)=0$.\n\n## (ix) Parametric Functions\n\nSome times a curve is described by expressing both $x$ and $y$ as function of a third variable \" $t$ \" or \" $\\theta$ \" which is called a parameter. The equations of the type $x=f(t)$ and $y=g(t)$ are called the parametric equations of the curve.\n\nThe functions of the form:\n(i) $\\begin{aligned} x=a t^{2} & x=a \\cos t \\\\ y=a t & y=a \\sin t\\end{aligned}$\n(ii) $\\begin{aligned} x=a \\cos \\theta & x=a \\sec \\theta \\\\ y=b \\sin \\theta & y=a \\tan \\theta\\end{aligned}$ (iv) $\\quad y=a \\tan \\theta$ are called parametric functions. Here the variable $t$ or $\\theta$ is called parameter.\n\n### 1.2.10 Even Function\n\nA function $f$ is said to be even if $f(-x)=f(x)$, for every number $x$ in the domain of $f$.

The composition of *f* and *g* is a function, denoted by *gof*, from *X* to *Z* and is defined by\n\n(*gof*(*x*) = *g*(*f*(*x*)) = *gf*(*x*), for all *x* ∈ *X*).\n\n### **1.3.1 Composition of Functions**\n\n#### **Explanation**\n\nConsider two real valued functions *f* and *g* defined by\n\n*f*(*x*) = 2*x* + 3 and *g*(*x*) = *x*^2\n\nthen *gof*(*x*) = *g*(*f*(*x*)) = *g*(2*x* + 3) = (2*x* + 3)^2\n\nThe arrow diagram of two successive mappings, *f*, *g*, is denoted by *gf* and is shown in the figure.\n\nThus a single composite function *gf*(*x*) is equivalent to two successive functions *f* followed by *g*.\n\n**Example 1:** Let the real valued functions *f* and *g* be defined by\n\n*f*(*x*) = 2*x* + 1 and *g*(*x*) = *x*^2 − 1\n\nObtain the expressions for (i) *fg* (*x*) (ii) *gf*(*x*) (iii) *f*^2 (*x*) (iv) *g*^2 (*x*)\n\n#### **Solution:**\n\n- (i) *fg*(*x*) = *f*(*g*(*x*)) = *f*(*x*^2 − 1) = 2(*x*^2 − 1) + 1 = 2*x*^2 − 1\n- (ii) *gf*(*x*) = *g*(*f*(*x*)) = *g*(2*x* + 1) = (2*x* + 1)^2 − 1 = 4*x*^2 + 4*x*\n- (iii) *f*^2(*x*) = *f*(*f*(*x*)) = *f*(2*x* + 1) = 2(2*x* + 1) + 1 = 4*x* + 3\n- (iv) *g*^2(*x*) = *g*(*g**x*) = *g*(*x*^2 − 1) = (*x*^2 − 1)^2 − 1 = *x*^4 − 2*x*^2\n\nWe observe from (i) and (ii) that *fg*(*x*) ≠ *gf*(*x*).\n\n#### **Note:**\n\n- It is important to note that, in general, *gf*(*x*) ≠ *fg*(*x*), because *gf*(*x*) means that *f* is applied first then followed by *g*, whereas *fg*(*x*) means that *g* is applied first then followed by *f*.\n- We usually write *ff* as *f*^2 and *fff* as *f*^3 and so on.\n\n### **1.3.2 Inverse of a Function**\n\nLet *f* be a one-one function from *X* onto *Y*. The **inverse function** of *f* denoted by *f*⁻¹, is a function from *Y* onto *X* and is defined by:\n\n*x* = *f*⁻¹(*y*), ∀ *y* ∈ *Y* if and only if *y* = *f*(*x*), ∀ *x* ∈ *X*.\n\n#### **Illustration by arrow diagram**\n\nThe inverse function reverses the correspondence of the original function, so that\n\n*f*⁻¹(*y*) = *x*, when *f*(*x*) = *y*\n\nand *f*(*x*) = *y*, when *f*⁻¹(*y*) = *x*.\n\nWe can find the composition of the functions *f* and *f*⁻¹ as follows:\n\nand (*fof*⁻¹)(*y*) = *f*(*f*⁻¹(*y*)) = *f*(*x*) = *y*.\n\nWe note that *f*⁻¹ *of* and *fof*⁻¹ are identity mappings on the domain and range of *f* and *f*⁻¹ respectively.\n\n### **1.3.3 Algebraic Method to find the Inverse Function**\n\nThe inverse function can be found by using the algebraic method as explained in the following example:\n\nExample 2: Let $f: R \\rightarrow R$ be the function defined by\n\n$$\nf(x)=2 x+1 \\text {. Find } f^{-1}(x)\n$$\n\n## Remember that:\n\nThe change of name of variable in the definition of function does not change that function where the domain and range coincide.\n\nSolution: We find the inverse of $f$ as follows:\nWrite $f(x)=2 x+1=y$\nSo that $y$ is the image of $x$ under $f$.\nNow solve this equation for $x$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y=2 x+1 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad 2 x=y-1 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad x=\\frac{y-1}{2} \\\\\n& \\therefore \\quad f^{-1}(y)=\\frac{1}{2}(y-1) \\quad \\text {; } \\quad x=f^{-1}(y)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo find $f^{-1}(x)$, replace $y$ by $x$.\n\n$$\n\\therefore \\quad f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}(x-1)\n$$\n\n## Verification:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nf\\left(f^{-1}(x)\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x-1)\\right)=2\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(x-1)\\right]+1=x \\\\\n\\text { and } \\quad f^{-1}(f(x))=f^{-1}(2 x+1)=\\frac{1}{2}(2 x+1-1)=x\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nExample 3: Without finding the inverse, state the domain and range of $f^{-1}$, where\n\n$$\nf(x)=2+\\sqrt{x-1}\n$$\n\nSolution: We see that $f$ is not defined when $x<1$.\n$\\therefore \\quad$ Domain $f=[1,+\\infty)$\nAs a varies over the interval $[1,+\\infty)$, the value of $\\sqrt{x-1}$ varies over the interval $[0,+\\infty)$.\n\nSo the value of $f(x)=2+\\sqrt{x-1}$ varies over the interval $[2,+\\infty)$. Therefore range $f=[2,+\\infty)$\nBy definition of inverse function $f^{-1}$, we have\ndomain $f^{-1}=$ range $f=[2,+\\infty)$\nand range $f^{-1}=$ domain $f=[1,+\\infty)$\n\n## EXERCISE 1.2\n\n1.

Before the definition of the limit of a function, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the meaning of the following phrases:\n\n### **1.4.1 Meaning of the Phrase \"x approaches zero\"**\n\nSuppose a variable *x* assumes in succession a series of values as\n\n$$\n1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{16}, \\ldots\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\n1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2^2}, \\frac{1}{2^3}, \\frac{1}{2^4}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{2^n}\n$$\n\nWe notice that *x* is becoming smaller and smaller as *n* increases and can be made as small as we please by taking *n* sufficiently large. This unending decrease of *x* is symbolically written as *x* → 0 and is read as \"*x* approaches zero\" or \"*x* tends to zero\".\n\n**Note:** The symbol *x* → 0 is quite different from *x* = 0\n\n- (i) *x* → 0 means that *x* is very close to zero but not actually zero.\n- (ii) *x* ≈ 0 means that *x* is actually zero.\n\n### **1.4.2 Meaning of the Phrase \"x approaches infinity\"**\n\nSuppose a variable *x* assumes in succession a series of values as\n\n$$\n1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, \\ldots\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n1, 10, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6, 10^7, 10^8, 10^9, 10^10\n$$\n\nIt is clear that *x* is becoming larger and larger as *n* increases and can be made as large as we please by taking *n* sufficiently large. This unending increase of *x* is symbolically written as \"*x* → ∞\" and is read as \"*x* approaches infinity\" or \"*x* tends to infinity\".\n\n### **1.4.3 Meaning of the Phrase \"x approaches α\"**\n\nSymbolically it is written as \"*x* → *α*\" which means that *x* is sufficiently close to but different from the number *α*, from both the left and right sides of *α* i.e., *x* − *α* becomes smaller and smaller as we please but *x* − *α* ≠ 0.\n\n### **1.4.4 Concept of Limit of a Function**\n\n#### **(i) By finding the area of circumscribing regular polygon**\n\nConsider a circle of unit radius which circumscribes a square (4-sided regular polygon) as shown in figure (1).\n\nThe side of square is √2 and its area is 2 square unit. It is clear that the area of inscribed 4-sided polygon is less than the area of the circum-circle.\n\nBisecting the arcs between the vertices of the square, we get an inscribed 8-sided polygon as shown in figure 2. Its area is 2√2 square unit which is closer to the area of circum-circle. A further similar bisection of the arcs gives an inscribed 16-sided polygon as shown in figure (3) with area 3.061 square unit which is more closer to the area of circum-circle.\n\nIt follows that as '*n*' , the number of sides of the inscribed polygon increases, the area of polygon increases and becoming nearer to 3.142 which is the area of circle of unit radius i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\pi^2 = \\pi(1)^2 = \\pi \\approx 3.142.\n$$\n\nWe express this situation by saying that the limiting value of the area of the inscribed polygon is the area of the circle as *n* approaches infinity, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\text{Area of inscribed polygon} \\rightarrow \\text{Area of circle} \\tag{18}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{as } n \\rightarrow \\infty\n$$\n\nThus area of circle of unit radius = π = 3.142 (approx.)\n\n#### **(ii) Numerical Approach**\n\nConsider the function *f*(*x*) = *x*^2\n\nThe domain of *f*(*x*) is the set of all real numbers.\n\nLet us find the limit of *f*(*x*) = *x*^2 as *x* approaches 2.\n\nThe table of values of $f(x)$ for different values of $x$ as $x$ approaches 2 from left and right is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\text { from left of } 2 \\longrightarrow 2 \\longleftarrow \\text { from right of } 2\n$$\n\n| $x$ | 1 | 1.5 | 1.8 | 1.9 | 1.99 | 1.999 | 1.9999 | 2.0001 | 2.001 | 2.01 | 2.1 | 2.2 | 2.5 | 3 |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| $f(x)=a^{2}$ | 1 | 3.375 | 5.832 | 6.859 | 7.8806 | 7.988 | 7.9988 | 8.0012 | 8.012 | 8.1206 | 9.261 | 10.648 | 15.625 | 27 |\n\nThe table shows that, as $x$ gets closer and closer to 2 (sufficiently close to 2 ), from both sides, $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to 8 .\n\nWe say that 8 is the limit of $f(x)$ when $x$ approaches 2 and is written as:\n\n$$\nf(x) \\rightarrow 8 \\text { as } x \\rightarrow 2 \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 2}\\left(x^{2}\\right)=8\n$$\n\n### 1.4.5 Limit of a Function\n\nLet a function $f(x)$ be defined in an open interval near the number \" $a$ \" (need not be at $a$ ).\n\nIf, as $x$ approaches \" $a$ \" from both left and right side of \" $a$ \", $f(x)$ approaches a specific number \" $L$ \" then \" $L$ \", is called the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$.\nSymbolically it is written as:\n\n$$\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow a^{-}} f(x)=\\mathrm{L} \\text { read as \"limit of } f(x) \\text {, as } x \\rightarrow a \\text {, is } L \\text { \". }\n$$\n\nIt is neither desirable nor practicable to find the limit of a function by numerical approach. We must be able to evaluate a limit in some mechanical way. The theorems on limits will serve this purpose.

However, in some cases it is necessary to investigate one-sided limits i.e., the left hand limit and the right hand limit.\n\n## (i) The Left Hand Limit\n\n$\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)=L$ is read as the limit of $f(x)$ is equal to $L$ as $x$ approaches $c$ from the left i.e., for all $x$ sufficiently close to $c$, but less than $c$, the value of $f(x)$ can be made as close as we please to $L$.\n\n## (ii) The Right Hand Limit\n\n$\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)=M$ is read as the limit of $f(x)$ is equal to $M$ as $x$ approaches $c$ from the right i.e., for all $x$ sufficiently close to $c$, but greater than $c$, the value of $f(x)$ can be made as close as we please to $M$.\n\nNote: The rules for calculating the left-hand and the right-hand limits are the same as we studied to calculate limits in the preceding section.\n\n### 1.6.2 Criterion for Existence of Limit of a Function\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x)=L \\quad \\text { if and only if } \\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) \\quad \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) \\quad L\n$$\n\nExample 1: Determine whether $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)$ and $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)$ exist, when\n\n$$\nf(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{lll}\n2 x+1 & \\text { if } & 0 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\\\\n7-x & \\text { if } & 2 \\leq x \\leq 4 \\\\\nx & \\text { if } & 4 \\leq x \\leq 6\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\n## Solution:\n\n(i) $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0}(2 x+1)=4+1=5$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0}(7-x)=7-2=5 \\\\\n& \\text { Since } \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)=5 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x) \\text { exists and is equal to } 5 \\text {. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(ii) $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}(7-x)=7-4=3$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0}(x)=4\n$$\n\nSince $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x) \\neq \\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)$\nTherefore $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)$ does not exist.\nWe have seen that sometimes $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x) \\neq f(c)$ and sometimes it does not and also sometimes $f(c)$ is not even defined whereas $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x)$ exists.\n\n### 1.6.3 Continuity of a function at a number\n\n## (a) Continuous Function\n\nA function $f$ is said to be continuous at a number \" $c$ \" if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:\n(i) $f(c)$ is defined.\n(ii) $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x)$ exists,\n(iii) $\\operatorname{Lim}_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) \\neq f(c)$\n\n## (b) Discontinuous Function\n\nIf one or more of these three conditions fail to hold at \" $c$ \", then the function $f$ is said to be discontinuous at \" $c$ \".\n\nExample 2: Consider the function $f(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}$\nSolution: $\\quad$ Here $f(1)$ is not defined\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad f(x)$ is discontinuous at 1 .\nFurther $\\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 1} f(x)=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 1} \\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 1}(x+1)=2$ (finite)\nTherefore $f(x)$ is continuous at any other number $x \\neq 1$\nExample 3: $\\quad$ For $f(x)=3 x^{2}-5 x+4$, discuss continuity of $f$ at $x=1$\n\nSolution: $\\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 2} f(x)=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 2}\\left(3 x^{2}-5 x+4\\right)=3 \\quad=5+4 \\quad 2$.\nand $f(1)=3-5+4=2$\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 2} f(x)=f(1)$\n$\\therefore \\quad f(x)$ is continuous at $x=1$\nExample 4: $\\quad$ Discuss the continuity of the function $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ at $x=3$.\n(a) $f(x)= \\begin{cases}\\frac{x^{2}-9}{x-3} & \\text { if } x \\neq 3 \\\\ 6 & \\text { if } x=3\\end{cases}$\n(b) $g(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-9}{x-3}$ if $x \\neq 3$\n\nSolution: (a) Given $f(3)=6$\n$\\therefore$ the function $f$ is defined at $x=3$.\nNow $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3^{-}} f(x)=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3} \\frac{x^{2}-9}{x-3}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3} \\frac{(x+3)(x-3)}{x-3} \\\\\n& =\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3}(x+3)=6\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs $\\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3^{-}} f(x)=6=f(3)$\n$\\therefore f(x)$ is continuous at $x=3$\n\nIt is noted that there is no break in the graph. (See figure (i))\n(b) $g(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-9}{x-3}$ if $x \\neq 3$\n\nAs $g(x)$ is not defined at $x=3$\n$\\Rightarrow g(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=3 \\quad$ (See figure (ii)). It is noted that there is a break in the graph at $x=3$\n\nExample 5: $\\quad$ Discuss continuity of $f$ at 3 ,\nFig (ii)\nwhen $f(x)= \\begin{cases}x-1, & \\text { if } \\quad x<3 \\\\ 2 x+1, & \\text { if } \\quad 3 \\leq x\\end{cases}$\nSolution: $\\quad$ A sketch of the graph of $f$ is shown in the figure (iii). We see that there is a break in the graph at the point when $x=3$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Now } f(3)=2(3)+1=7 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & \\text { Condition (i) is satisfied. } \\\\\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3^{-}} f(x)=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3^{-}} f(x-1)=3-1=2 \\\\\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3^{-}} f(x)=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3^{-}} f(2 x+1)=6+1=7 \\\\\n\\therefore \\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3^{-}} f(x) \\neq \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3^{-}} f(x) \\\\\n& \\text { i.e. condition (ii) is not satisfied } \\\\\n\\therefore \\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 3^{-}} f(x) \\text { does not exist }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence $f(x)$ is not continuous at $x=3$\nFig (iii)\n\n# EXERCISE 1.4\n\n1.

This can also be seen algebraically by solving (1) for y in terms of x.\n\n$$y = \\pm \\sqrt{4 - x^2}$$\n\nThe equation does not define y as a function of x.\n\nFor example, if x = 1, then y = ±√3.\n\nHence ((1, √3)) and ((1, −√3)) are two points on the circle and vertical line passes through these two points.\n\nWe can regard the circle as the union of two semi-circles.\n\n$$y = \\sqrt{4 - x^2} \\text{ and } y = -\\sqrt{4 - x^2}$$\n\nEach of which defines y as a function of x.\n\nWe observe that if we replace (x, y) in turn by (-x, y), (x, −y) and (-x, −y), there is no change in the given equation. Hence the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, x-axis and the origin.\n\n$$x = 0 \\text{ implies } y^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow y = \\pm 2$$\n\n$$x = 1 \\text{ implies } y^2 = 3 \\Rightarrow y = \\pm \\sqrt{3}$$\n\n$$x = 2 \\text{ implies } y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$$\n\nBy assigning values of x, we find the values of y. So we prepare a table for some values of x and y satisfying equation (1).\n\n|  x | 0 | 1 | $$\\sqrt{3}$$ | 2 | -1 | -$$\\sqrt{3}$$ | -2  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  y | ±2 | $$\\pm$$\\sqrt{3}$$ | ±1 | 0 | $$\\pm$$\\sqrt{3}$$ | ±1 | 0  |\n\nPlotting the points (x, y) and connecting them with a smooth curve as shown in the figure, we get the graph of a circle.\n\n**(b) The graph of ellipse of the form $$\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$**\n\n**Example 2:** Graph $$\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$ i.e., 9x² + 4y² = 36\n\n**Solution:** We observe that if we replace (x, y) in turn by (-x, y), (x, -y) and (-x, -y), there is no change in the given equation. Hence the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, x-axis and the origin.\n\n$$y = 0 \\text{ implies } \\quad x^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\pm 2$$\n\n$$x = 0 \\text{ implies } \\quad y^2 = 9 \\Rightarrow \\quad y = \\pm 3$$\n\nTherefore x-intercepts are 2 and -2 and y-intercepts are 3 and -3. By assigning values of x, we find the values of y.

For 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, the graph of the function is that of y = x and for 1 < x ≤ 2, the graph of the function is that of y = x - 1.\n\nWe prepare the table for some values of x and y in 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 satisfying the equations y = x and y = x - 1.\n\n|  x | 0 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 1 | 1.5 | 1.8 | 2  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  y | 0 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 1 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 1  |\n\nPlot the points (*x*, *y*). Connecting these points we get two straight lines, which is the graph of a discontinuous function.\n\n**Example 2:** Graph the function defined by $$y = \\frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}, \\quad x \\neq 3$$\n\n**Solution:** The domain of the function consists of all real numbers except 3.\n\nWhen *x* = 3, both the numerator and denominator are zero, and $$\\frac{0}{0}$$ is undefined.\n\nSimplifying we get $$y = \\frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3} = \\frac{(x - 3)(x + 3)}{x - 3} = x + 3$$ provided *x* ≠ 3.\n\nWe prepare a table for different values of *x* and *y* satisfy the equation $$y = x + 3$$ and *x* ≠ 3.\n\n|  *x* | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2.9 | 3 | 3.1 | 4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  *Y* | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 5.9 | 6 | 6.1 | 7  |\n\nPlot the points (*x*, *y*) and joining these points we get the graph of the function which is a straight line except the point (3, 6).\n\nThe graph is shown in the figure. This is a broken straight line with a break at the point (3, 6).\n\n### 1.7.7 Graphical Solution of the Equations\n\n(i) $$\\cos x = x$$ (ii) $$\\sin x = x$$ (iii) $$\\tan x = x$$\n\nWe solve the equation $$\\cos x = x$$ and leave the other two equations as an exercise for the students.\n\n**Solution:** To find the solution of the equation $$\\cos x = x$$, we draw the graphs of the two functions $$y = x$$ and $$y = \\cos x$$: $$-\\pi \\leq x \\leq \\pi$$\n\n*version: 1.1*\n\n### Scale for graphs\n\n- Along *x*-axis, length of side of small square = $$\\frac{\\pi}{6}$$ radian\n- Along *y*-axis, length of side of small square = 0.1 unit\n- Two points (0, 0) and (π/3, 1) lie on the line *y* = *x*\n\nWe prepare a table for some values of *x* and *y* in the interval $$-\\pi \\leq x \\leq \\pi$$ it satisfies the equation $$y = \\cos x$$.\n\n|  *x* | $-\\pi$ | -5π/6 | -2π/3 | $-\\pi/2$ | $-\\pi/3$ | $-\\pi/6$ | 0 | $\\pi/6$ | $\\pi/3$ | $\\pi/2$ | 2π/3 | 5π/6 | $\\pi$  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  $y = \\cos x$ | -1 | -.87 | -.5 | 0 | -.5 | .87 | 1 | .87 | .5 | 0 | -.5 | -.87 | -1  |\n\nThe graph shows that the equations $$y = x$$ and $$y = \\cos x$$ intersect at only where $$x = \\frac{43}{180} \\pi$$ radian = 0.73\n\n**Check:** $$\\cos \\left(\\frac{43}{180} \\pi\\right) = \\cos 43^\\circ = 0.73$$\n\n# Note: Since the scales along the two axes are different so the line $y=x$ is not equally inclined to both the axes.\n\n## EXERCISE 1.5\n\n1. Draw the graphs of the following equations\n(i) $x^{2}+y^{2}=9$\n(ii) $\\frac{x^{2}}{16}+\\frac{y^{2}}{4}=1$\n(iii) $y=e^{2 x}$\n(iv) $y=3^{x}$\n2. Graph the curves that has the parametric equations given below\n(i) $x=t, y=t^{2},-3 \\leq t \\leq 3$\nwhere \" $t$ \" is a parameter\n(ii) $x=t-1, y=2 t-1,-1<t<5$\nwhere \" $t$ \" is a parameter\n(iii) $x=\\sec \\theta, y=\\tan \\theta$\nwhere \" $\\theta$ \" is a parameter\n3.

          "title": "DIFFERENTIATION\n\n### 2.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe ancient Greeks knew the concepts of area, volume and centroids etc. which are related to integral calculus. Later on, in the seventeenth century, Sir Isaac Newton, an English mathematician (1642-1727) and Gottfried Whilhelm Leibniz, a German mathematician, (1646-1716) considered the problem of instantaneous rates of change. They reached independently to the invention of differential calculus. After the development of calculus, mathematics became a powerful tool for dealing with rates of change and describing the physical universe.\n\n## Dependent and Independent Variables\n\nIn differential calculus, we mainly deal with the rate of change of a dependent variable with respect to one or more independent variables. Now, we first explain the terms dependent and independent variables.\n\nWe usually write $y=\\sigma^{f}(x)$ where $f(x)$ is the value of $f$ at $x \\quad D_{y}$ (the domain of the function $f$ ). Let us consider the functional relation $v=f(x)=x^{2}+1$ (A)\n\nFor different values of $x \\in D_{y}, f(x)$ or the expression $x^{2}+1$ assumes different values. For example; if $x=1,1.5,2$ etc., then\n\n$$ \\begin{aligned} & f(1)=(1)^{2}+1=2, f(1.5)=(1.5)^{2}+1=2.25+1=3.25 \\ & f(2)=(2)^{2}+1=4+1=5 \\end{aligned} $$\n\nWe see that for the change $1.5-1=0.5$ in the value of $x$, the corresponding change in the value of $y$ or $f(x)$ is given by $f(1.5)-f(1)=3.25-2=1.25$ It is obvious that the change in the value of the expression $x^{2}+1$ (or $f(x)$ ) depends upon the change in the value of the variable $x$. As $x$ behaves independently, so we call it the independent variable. But the behaviour of $y$ or $f(x)$ depends on the variable $x$, so we call it the dependent variable.\n\nThe change in the value of $x$ (positive or negative) is called the increment of $x$ and is denoted by the symbol $\\delta x$ (read as delta $x$ ). The corresponding change in the dependent variable $y$ or $f(x)$ for the change $\\delta x$ in the value of $x$ is denoted by $\\delta y$ or $\\delta f=f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)$. version: 1.1\n\nUsually the small changes in the values of the variables are taken as increments of variables. Note: In this Chapter we shall discuss functions of the form $y=f(x)$ where $x=D_{y}$ and is called an independent variable while $x$ is called the dependent variable.\n\n### 2.1.1 AVERAGE RATE OF CHANGE\n\nSuppose a particle (or an object) is moving in a straight line and its positions (from some fixed point) after times $t$ and $t_{1}$ are given by $s(t)$ and $s\\left(t_{1}\\right)$, then the distance traveled in the time interval $t_{1}-t$ where $t_{1}>t$ is $s\\left(t_{1}\\right)-s(t)$ and the difference quotient $\\frac{s\\left(t_{1}\\right)-s(t)}{t_{1}-t}$ (i) represents the average rate of change of distance over the time interval $t_{1}-t$. If $t_{1}-t$ is not small, then the average rate of change does not represent an accurate rate of change near $t$. We can elaborate this idea by a moving particle in a straight line whose position in metres after $t$ seconds is given by\n\n$$ s(t)=t^{2}+t $$\n\nWe construct a table for different values of $t$ as under:\n\n|  Interval | Average rate of change (i.e. average speed)  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  $t=3$ secs to $t=5$ secs | $\\frac{s(5)-s(3)}{5-3}=\\frac{(25+5)-(9+3)}{2}=\\frac{30-12}{2}=9$  |\n|  $t=3$ secs to $t=4$ secs | $\\frac{s(4)-s(3)}{4-3}=\\frac{(16+4)-12}{1}=\\frac{20-12}{1}=8$  |\n|  $t=3$ secs to $t=3.5$ secs | $\\frac{s(3.5)-s(3)}{3.5-3}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{49}{4}+\\frac{7}{2}\\right)-12}{0.5}=\\frac{\\frac{15}{4}}{0.5}=7.5$  |\n\nWe see that none of average rates of change approximates to the actual speed of the particle after 3 seconds.\n\nNow we construct a table by taking small intervals.\n\n|  Interval | Average rate of change  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  $t=3$ secs to $t=3.1 \\mathrm{secs}$ | $\\frac{((3.1)^{2}+3.1)-12}{3.1-3}=\\frac{12.71-12}{0.1}=\\frac{0.71}{0.1}=7.1$  |\n|  $t=3$ secs to $t=3.01 \\mathrm{secs}$ | $\\frac{((3.01)^{2}+3.01)-12}{3.01-3}=\\frac{12.0701-12}{0.01}=\\frac{0.0701}{0.01}=7.01$  |\n|  $t=3$ secs to $t=3.001 \\mathrm{secs}$ | $\\frac{((3.001)^{2}+3.001)-12}{3.001-3}=\\frac{12.007001-12}{0.001}=\\frac{0.007001}{0.001}=7.001$  |\n\nThe above table shows that the average rate of change after 3 seconds approximates to 7 metre/sec. as the length of the interval becomes very very small. In other words, we can say that the speed of the particle is 7 metre/sec. after 3 seconds.\n\nIf $t_{i}=t+\\delta t$ then the difference quoteint (i) becomes\n\n$$\n\\frac{s(t+\\delta t)-s(t)}{\\delta t}\n$$\n\nwhich represents the average rate of change of distance over the interval $\\delta t$ and\n\n$$\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{s(t+\\delta t)-s(t)}{\\delta t}, \\text { provided this limit exists, is called the instantaneous rate of change }\n$$\n\nof distance 's' at time $t$.\n\n### 2.1.2 Derivative of a Function\n\nLet $f$ be a real valued function continuous in the interval $\\left(x, x_{i}\\right) \\subseteq D_{f}$ (the domain of $f$ ), then\n\n$$ \\text { difference quotient } \\frac{f\\left(x_{i}\\right)-f(x)}{x_{i}-x} $$\n\nrepresents the average rate of change in the value of $f$ with respect to the change $x_{i}-x$ in the value of independent variable $x$. If $x_{i}$, approaches to $x$, then\n\n$$\n\\lim _{x_{i} \\rightarrow x} \\frac{f\\left(x_{i}\\right)-f(x)}{x_{i}-x}\n$$\n\nprovided this limit exists, is called the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ with respect to $x$ at $x$ and is written as $f^{\\prime}(x)$. If $x_{i}=x+\\delta x$ i.e., $x_{i}-x=\\delta x$, then the expression (i) can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}\n$$\n\nprovided the limit exists, is defined to be the derivative of $f$ (or differential coefficient of $f$ ) with respect to $x$ at $x$ and is denoted by $f^{\\prime}(x)$ (read as \"f-prime of $x$ \"). The domain of $f^{\\prime}$ consists of all $x$ for which the limit exists. If $x \\in D_{f}$ and $f^{\\prime}(x)$ exists, then $f$ is said to be differentiable at $x$. The process of finding $f^{\\prime}$ is called differentiation.\n\n## Notation for Derivative\n\nSeveral notations are used for derivatives. We have used the functional symbol $f^{\\prime}(x)$, for the derivative of $f$ at $x$. For the function $y=f(x)$.\n\n$$ y+\\delta y=f(x+\\delta x) $$\n\nwhere $\\delta y$ is the increment of $y$ (change in the value of $y$ ) corresponding to $\\delta x$, the change in the value of $x$, then\n\n$$ \\delta y=f(x+\\delta x)-f(x) $$\n\nDividing both the sides of (iv) by $\\delta x$, we get\n\n$$ \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}=\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x} $$\n\nTaking limit of both the sides of (v) as $\\delta x \\rightarrow 0$, we have\n\n$$ \\begin{aligned} & \\lim *{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x} \\ & \\text { (vi) } \\ & \\frac{\\lim }{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x} \\text { is denoted by } \\frac{d y}{d x}, \\text { so (vi) is written as } \\frac{d y}{d x}=f^{\\prime}(x) \\end{aligned} $$\n\nNote: The symbol $\\frac{d y}{d x}$ is used for the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ and here it is not a quotient of $d y$ and $d x . \\frac{d y}{d x}$ is also denoted by $y^{\\prime}$.\n\nNow we write, in a table the notations for the derivative of $y=f(x)$ used by different mathematicians:\n\n|  Name of\nMathematician | Leibniz | Newton | Lagrange | Cauchy  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Notation used for derivative | $\\frac{d y}{d x} \\quad \\frac{d f}{d x}$ | $f(x)$ | $f^{\\prime}(x)$ | $D f(x)$  |\n\nIf we replace $x+\\delta x$ by $x$ and $x$ by a, then the expression $f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)$ becomes $f(x)-f(a)$, and the change $\\delta x$ in the independent variable, in this case, is $x-a$.\n\nSo the expression $\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}$ is written as $\\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} \\quad$ (vii) Taking the limit of the expressiom(vii) when $x \\rightarrow a$, gives\n\n$$ \\lim _{x \\rightarrow a} \\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=f^{\\prime}(a) \\text {. Here } f^{\\prime}(a) $$\n\nis called the derivative of $f$ at $x=a$.\n\n### 2.2 FINDING $\\mathbf{f}^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{x})$ FROM DEFINITION OF DERIVATIVE\n\nGiven a function $f, f^{\\prime}(x)$ if it exists, can be found by the following four steps Step I Find $f(x+\\delta x)$ Step II Simplify $f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)$ Step III Divide $f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)$ by $\\delta x$ to get $\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}$ and simplify it Step IV Find $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}$ The method of finding derivatives by this process is called differentiation by definition or by ab-initio or from first principle.\n\nExample 1: Find the derivative of the following functions by definition (a) $f(x)=\\infty$ (b) $f(x) \\quad x^{2}$\n\nSolution: (a) For $f(x)=c$ (i) $f(x+\\delta x)=c$ (ii) $f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)=c-c=0$ (iii) $\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}=\\frac{0}{\\delta x}=0$ (iv) $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0}(0)=0$\n\nThus $\\quad f^{\\prime}(x)=0$, that is, $\\frac{d}{d x}(c)=0$ (b) For $f(x)=x^{2}$ (i) $f(x+\\delta x)=(x+\\delta x)^{2}$ (ii) $f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)=(x+\\delta x)^{2}-x^{2}=x^{2}+2 x \\delta x+(\\delta x)^{2}-x^{2}$ ${ }^{\\infty} 2 x \\delta x+(\\delta x)^{2}=(2 x+\\delta x) \\delta x$ version: 1.1\n\n(ii) $\\frac{f(x+\\delta

If we denote $f^{\\prime}$ as the first derivative of $f$, then $\\left(f^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\prime}$ is the derivative of $f^{\\prime}$ and is called the second derivative of $f$. For convenience we write it as $f^{\\prime \\prime}$.\n\nSimilarly $\\left(f^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\prime}$, the derivative of $f^{\\prime \\prime}$, is called the third derivative of $f$ and is written as $f^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}$. In general, for $n \\geq 4$, the $n$th derivative of $f$ is written as $f^{(n)}$.

(See the figure 2.21.1)\n\nDrawing the ordinates $P M, Q N$ and perpendicular $P R$ to $N Q$, we have\n$R Q=N Q-N R=N Q-M P=f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)$\nFIGURE 2.21.1\nand $P R=M N=O N-O M=x+\\delta x-x=\\delta x$\nThus $\\tan m \\angle X S Q=\\tan m \\angle R P Q$\n$-\\frac{R Q}{P R}=\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}$\nRevolving the secant line $P Q$ about $P$ towards $P$, some of its successive positions $P Q_{i}, P Q_{j}, P Q_{k}, \\ldots$ are shown in the figure 2.21.2. Points $Q_{i}(i=1,2,3, \\ldots)$ are getting closer and closer to the point $P$ and $P R$, i.e; $\\delta x_{i}(i=1,2,3, \\ldots)$ are approaching to zero.\n\nIn other words we can say that the revolving secant line approaches the tangent line $P T$ as its limiting position at $P$ while $\\delta x$ approaches zero, that is,\n$\\tan m \\angle X S Q \\rightarrow \\tan m \\angle X T P$ when $\\delta \\mathrm{x} \\rightarrow 0$\nor $\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x} \\rightarrow \\tan m \\angle X T P$ as $\\delta x \\rightarrow 0$\nso $\\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}=\\tan m \\angle X T P$\n$$\n\\text { or } \\quad f^{\\prime}(x)=\\tan m \\angle X T P\n$$\n\nThus the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $(x, f(x))$ is $f^{\\prime}(x)$.\nExample 1: $\\quad$ Discuss the tangent line to the graph of the function $|x|$ at $x=0$.\n\nSolution: Let $\\quad f(x)=|x|$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f(0)=|0|=0 \\quad \\text { and } \\\\\n& f(0+\\delta x)=|0+\\delta x|=|\\delta x| \\\\\n& \\text { so } \\quad f(0+\\delta x)-f(0)=|\\delta x|-0 \\\\\n& \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{f(0+\\delta x)-f(0)}{\\delta x}=\\frac{|\\delta x|}{\\delta x} \\\\\n& \\text { Thus } f^{\\prime}(0)=\\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{|\\delta x|}{\\delta x} \\\\\n& \\text { Because }|\\delta x|=\\delta x \\quad \\text { when } \\delta x>0 \\\\\n& \\text { and } \\quad|\\delta x|=-\\delta x \\quad \\text { when } \\delta x<0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nso we consider one-sided limits\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0^{+}} \\frac{|\\delta x|}{\\delta x}=\\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0^{-}} \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta x}=1 \\\\\n& \\text { and } \\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0^{-}} \\frac{|\\delta x|}{\\delta x}=\\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0^{-}} \\frac{-\\delta x}{\\delta x}-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe right hand and left hand limits are not equal, therefore, the $\\lim _{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0^{-}} \\frac{|\\delta x|}{\\delta x}$ does not exist.\n\nThis means that $f^{\\prime}(0)$, the derivative of $f$ at $x=0$ does not exist and there is no tangent line to the graph of $f$ and $x=0$\n(see the figure 2.21.3).\n\nExample 2: Find the equations of the tangents to the curve $x^{2}-y^{2}-6 y=0$ at the point whose abscissa is 4 .\n\nSolution. Given that $x^{2}-y^{2}-6 y=0$\nWe first find the $y$-coordinates of the points at which the equations of the tangents are to be found. Putting $x=4$ is (i) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 16-y^{2}-6 y=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow y^{2}+6 y-16=0 \\\\\n& \\text { or } y=\\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36+64}}{2}=\\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2}=\\frac{-6 \\pm 10}{2}, \\text { that is, } \\\\\n& y=\\frac{-6+10}{2}=\\frac{4}{2}=2 \\quad \\text { or } \\quad y=\\frac{-6-10}{2}=\\frac{-16}{2}=-8\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus the points are $(4,2)$ and $(4,-8)$.\nDifferentiating (i) w.r.t.

Then\n(i) $f$ is increasing on the interval $(a, b)$ if $f\\left(x_{2}\\right)>f\\left(x_{1}\\right)$ whenever $x_{2}>x_{1}$\n(ii) $f$ is decreasing on the interval $(a, b)$ if $f\\left(x_{2}\\right)<f\\left(x_{1}\\right)$ whenever $x_{2}>x_{1}$\nWe see that a differentiable function $f$ is increasing on $(a, b)$ if tangent lines to its graph at all points $(x, f(x))$ where $x \\in(a, b)$ have positive slopes, that is,\n$f^{\\prime}(x)>0$ for all $x$ such that $a<x<b$\nand $f$ is decreasing on $(a, b)$ if tangent lines to its graph at all points $(x, f(x))$ where $x \\in(a, b)$, have negative slopes, that is, $f^{\\prime}(x)<0$ for all $x$ such that $a<x<b$\n\nNow we state the above observation in the following theorem.\n\n## Theorem:\n\nLet $f$ be a differentiable function on the open interval (a,b). Then\n(i) $f$ is increasing on $(a, b)$ if $f^{\\prime}(x)>0$ for each $x \\in(a, b)$\n(ii) $f$ is decreasing on $(a, b)$ if $f^{\\prime}(x)<0$ for each $x \\in(a, b)$\n\nLet $f(x)=x^{2}$, then\n\n$$\nf\\left(x_{2}\\right)-f\\left(x_{1}\\right)=x_{2}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}=\\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\\right)\\left(x_{2}+x_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nIf $\\quad x_{1}, x_{2} \\in(-\\infty, 0)$ and $x_{2}>x_{1}$, then\nversion: 1.1\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f\\left(x_{2}\\right)-f\\left(x_{1}\\right)<0 \\quad\\left(\\because x_{2}-x_{1}>0 \\text { and } x_{2}+x_{1}<0\\right) \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow f\\left(x_{2}\\right)<f\\left(x_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow f \\text { is decreasing on the interval }(-\\infty, 0) \\\\\n& \\text { If } x_{1}, x_{2} \\in(0, \\infty) \\text { and } x_{2}>x_{1} \\text {, then } \\\\\n& f\\left(x_{2}\\right)-f\\left(x_{1}\\right)>0 \\quad\\left(\\because x_{2}-x_{1}>0 \\text { and } x_{2}+x_{1}>0\\right) \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow f\\left(x_{2}\\right)>f\\left(x_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow f \\text { is increasing on the interval }(0, \\infty)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $f^{\\prime}(x)=2 x$ and $f^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{x})-\\mathbf{0}$ for all $x \\quad(\\quad, 0)$, therefore,\n$f$ is decreasing on the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$\nAlso $f^{\\prime}(x)>0$ for all $x \\in(0, \\infty)$, so $f$ is increasing on the interval $(0, \\infty)$.\nFrom the above theorem we can conclude that\n\n1. $f^{\\prime}\\left(x_{1}\\right)<0 \\Rightarrow f$ is decreasing at $x_{1}$\n2. $f^{\\prime}\\left(x_{1}\\right)=0 \\Rightarrow f$ is neither increasing nor decreasing at $x_{1}$\n3. $f^{\\prime}\\left(x_{1}\\right)>0 \\Rightarrow f$ is increasing at $x_{1}$\n\nNow we illustrate the ideas discussed so far considering the function $f$ defined as\n$f(x)=4 x-x^{2}$\nTo draw the graph of $f$, we form a table of some ordered pairs which belongs to $f$\n\n| $x$ | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $y=f(x)$ | -5 | 0 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 0 | -5 |\n\nFrom the graph of *f*, it is obvious that *y* rises from 0 to 4 as *x* increases from 0 to 2 and *y* falls from 4 to 0 as *x* increases from 2 to 4.\n\nIn other words, we can say that the function *f* defined as in (I) is increasing in the interval 0 < *x* < 2 and is decreasing in the interval 2 < *x* < 4.\n\nThe slope of the tangent to the graph of *f* at any point in the interval 0 < *x* < 2, in which the function *f* is increasing is positive because it makes an acute angle with the positive direction of *x*-axis. (See the tangent line to the graph of *f* at (1, 3)).\n\nBut the slope of the tangent line to the graph of *f* at any point in the interval 2 < *x* < 4 in which the function *f* is decreasing is negative as it makes an obtuse angle with the positive direction of *x*-axis. (See the tangent line to the graph of *f* at (3, 3)).\n\nAs we know that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of *f* at (*x*, *f*(*x*)) is *f* (*x*), so the derivative of the function *f* i.e., *f* (*x*), is positive in the interval in which *f* is increasing and *f* (*x*), is negative in the interval in which *f* is decreasing.\n\nThe function *f* under consideration is actually increasing at each *x* for which *f* (*x*) > 0.\n\n$$\n\\text{i.e. } 4 - 2x > 0 \\qquad \\Rightarrow -2x > -4 \\qquad \\Rightarrow x < 2\n$$\n\nThus it is increasing in the interval (-∞, 2). Similarly we can show that it is decreasing, in the interval (2, ∞).\n\nNow we give an analytical approach to the above discussion.\n\nLet *f* be an increasing function in some interval in which it is differentiable. Let *x* and *x* + *δx* be two, points in that interval such that *x* + *δx* > *x*.\n\nAs the function *f* is increasing in the interval, it conveys the fact that *f*(*x* + *δx*) > *f*(*x*).\n\nConsequently we have, *f*(*x* + *δx*) - *f*(*x*) > 0 and (*x* + *δx*) - *x* > 0, that is,\n\n$$\nf(x + \\deltax) - f(x) > 0 \\text{ and } \\deltax > 0\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\frac{f(x + \\deltax) - f(x)}{\\delta x} > 0\n$$\n\nThe above difference quotient becomes one-sided limit\n\n$$\n\\lim_{\\deltax \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + \\deltax) - f(x)}{\\delta x}\n$$\n\nAs *f* is differentiable, so *f* (*x*) exists and one sided limit must equal to *f* (*x*). Thus *f* (*x*) > 0.\n\n### Example 1: Determine the values of *x* for which *f* defined as *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 2*x* − 3 is\n\n(i) increasing (ii) decreasing.\n\n(iii) find the point where the function is neither increasing nor decreasing.\n\n**Solution:** The table of some ordered pairs satisfying *f*(*x*) = *x*² + 2*x* − 3 is given below:\n\n|  *x* | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  *y* = *f*(*x*) | 5 | 0 | -3 | -4 | -3 | 0 | 5  |\n\nThe graph of $f$ is shown in the figure2.22.2.\n\n$$\nf^{\\prime}(x)=2 x+2\n$$\n\n(i) The condition $f^{\\prime}(x)>0 \\quad \\Rightarrow 2 x+2>0$\n\n$$\n\\Rightarrow 2 x \\quad>-2\n$$\n\nwhich gives $x>-1$, so the function $f$ defined as $f(x)=x^{2}+2 x-3$ is increasing in the interval $(-1, \\infty)$.\n(ii) And the condition $f^{\\prime}(x)<0 \\Rightarrow 2 x+2<0$\n\n$$\n\\Rightarrow 2 x<-2\n$$\n\nwhich gives $x<-1$, so the function $f$ under consideration in the example I is decreasing in the interval $(-\\infty,-1)$.\n(iii) The function is neither increasing nor decreasing where $f^{\\prime}(x)=0$, that is,\n\n$$\n2 x+2=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow x=-1\n$$\n\nIf $x=-1$ then $f(-1)=(-1)^{2}+2(-1)-3=-4$. Thus $f$ is neither increasing nor deceasing at the point $(-1,-4)$.\nNote: Any point where $f$ is neither increasing nor decreasing is called a stationary point, provided that $f^{\\prime}(x)=0$ at that point.\n\nExample 2: Determine the intervals in which $f$ is increasing or it is decreasing if\n\n$$\nf(x)=x^{2}-6 x^{2}+9 x\n$$\n\nSolution. $f^{\\prime}(x)=3 x^{2}-12 x+9$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =3\\left(x^{2}-4 x+3\\right) \\\\\n& =3(x-1)(x-3) \\\\\n& f^{\\prime}(x)>0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & x^{2}-4 x+3>0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & (x-1)(x-3)>0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$(x-1)(x-3)>0^{\\prime}$ in the intervals $(-\\infty, 1)$ and $(3, \\infty)$\n$f^{\\prime}(x)<0 \\quad \\Rightarrow(x-1)(x-3)<0$\n$(x-1)(x-3)<0$ if $x>1$ and $x<3$ that is $1<x<3$\n\n### 2.20 RELATIVE EXTREMA\n\nLet $(c-\\delta x, c+\\delta x) \\subseteq D_{c^{-}},($domain of a function $f)$, where $\\delta x$ is small positive number.\n\nIf $f(c) \\geq f(x)$ for all $x \\in(c-\\delta x, c+\\delta x)$ then the function $f$ is said to have a relative maxima at $x=c$.\n\nSimilarly if $f(c) \\leq f(x)$ for all $x \\in(c-\\delta x, c+\\delta x)$, then the function $f$ has relative minima at $x=c$.\n\nBoth relative maximum and relative minimum are called in general relative extrema.\n\nThe graph of a function is shown in the adjoining figure. It has relative maxima at $x=b$ and $x=d$. But at $x=a$ and $x=c$, it has relative minima.\n\nNote that the relative maxima at $x=d$ is not the highest point of the graph.\n\n### 2.21 CRITICAL VALUES AND CRITICAL POINTS\n\nIf $c \\in D f$ and $f^{\\prime}(c)=0$ or $f^{\\prime}(c)$ does not exist, then the number $c$ is called a critical value for $f$ while the point $(c, f(c))$ on the graph of $f$ is named as a critical point.\n\nNote: There are functions which have extrema (maxima or minima) at the points where their derivatives do not exist. For example, the derivatives of the function $f$ and $\\phi$ defined as.\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nf(x)=|x| \\\\\n\\text { and } \\phi(x)=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n2-x \\quad x>0 \\\\\n2+x \\quad x \\leq 0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\ndo not exist at $(0,0)$ and $(0,2)$ respectively.\nBut $f$ has minima at $(0,0)$ and $\\phi$ has maxima at $(0,2)$. See the adjoining figures.\n\nThose critical points on the graph of $f$ at which $f^{\\prime}(x)=0$ are called stationary points of $f$.\n\nNow we discuss relative maxima and relative minima of the differentiable function $f$ defined as:\n\n$$\ny=f(x)=x^{3}-3 x^{2}+4 \\ldots(1)\n$$\n\nGraph of $f$ is drawn with the help of some ordered pairs tabulated as below:\n\n| $X$ | $-3 / 2$ | -1 | $-1 / 2$ | 0 | $1 / 2$ | 1 | $3 / 2$ | 2 | $5 / 2$ | 3 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $Y$ | $-49 / 8$ | 0 | $25 / 8$ | 4 | $27 / 8$ | 2 | $5 / 8$ | 0 | $7 / 8$ | 4 |\n\nNow differentiating (i) w.r.t. ' $x$ ' we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f^{\\prime}(x)=3 x^{2}-6 x=3 x(x-2) \\\\\n& f^{\\prime}(x)=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow 3 x(x-2)=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow x=0 \\text { or } x=2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow we consider an interval $(-\\delta x, \\delta x)$ in the neighbourhood of $x=0$. Let $0-\\varepsilon$ is a point in the interval $(-\\delta x, 0)$ We see that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f^{\\prime}(0-\\varepsilon)=3(-\\varepsilon)(-\\varepsilon-2) \\\\\n& =3 \\varepsilon(\\varepsilon+2)>0 \\quad(\\because \\varepsilon>0, \\varepsilon+2>0) \\\\\n& \\text { That is } f^{\\prime}(x) \\text { is positive for all } x \\in(-\\delta x, 0) \\text {. } \\\\\n& \\text { Let } 0+\\varepsilon_{i} \\text { is a point in the interval }(0, \\delta x) \\text {, then we have } \\\\\n& f^{\\prime}\\left(0+\\varepsilon_{i}\\right)=3\\left(\\varepsilon_{i}\\right)\\left(\\varepsilon_{i}-2\\right) \\\\\n& =3 \\varepsilon_{i}\\left(2 \\varepsilon_{i}\\right) 0\\left(\\because 2-\\varepsilon_{i}>0, \\varepsilon_{i}>0\\right), \\text { that is, } \\\\\n& f^{\\prime}(x) \\text { is negative for all } x \\in(0, \\delta x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe note that $f^{\\prime}(x)>0$ before $x=0, f^{\\prime}(x)=0$ at $x \\ll 0$ and $f^{\\prime}(x) \\quad 0$ after $x=0$.\nThe graph of $f$ shows that it has relative maxima at $x=0$.\nThus we conclude that a function has relative maxima at $x=c$ if $f^{\\prime}(x)>0$, before $x=c f^{\\prime}(c)=0$ and $f^{\\prime}(x)<0$ after $x=c$.\n\nConsidering an interval $(2-\\delta x, 2+\\delta x)$ in the neighbourhood of $x=2$ we find the values of $f^{\\prime}(2-\\varepsilon)$ and $f^{\\prime}(2+\\varepsilon)$ when $2-\\varepsilon \\in(2-\\delta x, 2)$ and $2+\\varepsilon \\in(2,2+\\delta x)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf^{\\prime}(2-\\varepsilon) & =3(2-\\varepsilon)(2-\\varepsilon-2) & {\\left[\\because f^{\\prime}(x)=3 x(x-2)\\right]} \\\\\n& =3(2-\\varepsilon)(-\\varepsilon) & \\\\\n& =-3 \\varepsilon(2-\\varepsilon)<0 & (\\because \\varepsilon>0,2-\\varepsilon>0) \\\\\n\\text { and } f^{\\prime}(2+\\varepsilon) & =3(2+\\varepsilon)(2+\\varepsilon-2) & \\\\\n& =3 \\varepsilon(2+\\varepsilon)>0 & (\\because \\varepsilon>0,2+\\varepsilon>0)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe see that $f^{\\prime}(x)<0$ before $x=2, f^{\\prime}(x)=0$ at $x=2$ and $f^{\\prime}(x)>0$ after $x=2$.\nIt is obvious from the graph that it has relative minima at $x=2$.\nThus we conclude that a function has relative minima at $x=c$ if $f^{\\prime}(x)<0$ before $x=c, f^{\\prime}(x)=0$ at $x=c$ and $f^{\\prime}(x)>0$ after $x=c$.\n\n## First Derivative Rule:\n\nLet $f$ be differentiable in neighbourhood of $c$ where $f^{\\prime}(c)=0$.\n\n1. If $f^{\\prime}(x)$ changes sign from positive to negative as $x$ increases through $c$, then $f(c)$ the relative maxima of $f$.\n2. If $f^{\\prime}(x)$ changes sign from negative to positive as $x$ increases through $c$, then $f(c)$ is the relative minima of $f$.\n\nNote: 1. A stationary point is called a turning point if it is either a maximum point or a minimum point.\n2. If $f^{\\prime}(x)>0$ before the point $x=a, f^{\\prime}(x)=0$ at $x=0$ and $f^{\\prime}(x)>0$ after $x=0$, then $f$ does not has a relative maxima.\nSee the graph of $f(x)=x^{3}$. In this case, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f^{\\prime}(x)=3 x^{2}, \\text { that is, } \\\\\n& f^{\\prime}(0-\\varepsilon)=3(-\\varepsilon)^{2}=3 \\varepsilon^{2}>0 \\\\\n& \\text { and } f^{\\prime}(0+\\varepsilon)=3(\\varepsilon)^{2}=3 \\varepsilon^{2}>0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe function $f$ is increasing before $x=0$ and also it is increasing after $x=0$.\nSuch a point of the function is called the point of inflexion.\n## Second Derivative Test:\n\nWe have noticed that the first derivative $f^{\\prime}(x)$ of a function changes its sign from positive to negative at the point where $f$ has relative maxima, that is, $f^{\\prime}$ is a decreasing function in the neighbouring interval containing the point where $f$ has relative maxima.\n\nThus $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)$ is negative at the point where $f$ has a relative maxima.\nBut $f^{\\prime}(x)$ of a function $f$ changes its sign from negative to positive at the point where $f$ has relative minima, that is, $f^{\\prime}$ is an increasing function in the neighbouring interval containing the point where $f$ has relative minima.\n\nThus $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)$ is positive at the point where $f$ has relative minima.\n\n## Second Derivative Rule\n\nLet $f$ be differential function in a neighbourhood of $c$ where $f^{\\prime}(c)=0$. Then\n\n1. $f$ has relative maxima at $c$ if $f^{\\prime \\prime}(c)<0$.\n2. $f$ has relative minima at $c$ if $f^{\\prime \\prime}(c)>0$.\n\nExample 1: $\\quad$ Examine the function defined as\n\n$$\nf(x)=x^{3}-6 x^{2}+9 x \\text { for extreme values. }\n$$\n\nSolution: $f^{\\prime}(x)=3 x^{2}-12 x+9$\n\n$$\n=3\\left(x^{2}-4 x+3\\right)=3(x-1)(x-3)\n$$\n\n## First Method\n\nIf $x=1-\\varepsilon$ where $\\varepsilon$ is very very small positive number, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (x-1)(x-3)=(1-\\varepsilon-1)(1-\\varepsilon-3)=(-\\varepsilon)(-\\varepsilon-2)=\\varepsilon(2+\\varepsilon)>0 \\text { that is } \\\\\n& f^{\\prime}(x)>0 \\text { before } x=1 . \\text { For } x=1 \\quad \\varepsilon \\text {, we have } \\\\\n& (x-1)(x-3)=(1+\\varepsilon-1)(1+\\varepsilon-3)=( \\varepsilon)(-2+\\varepsilon)=-\\varepsilon(2-\\varepsilon)<0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThat is, $f^{\\prime}(x)<0$ after $x=1$\nAs $f^{\\prime}(x)>0$ before $x=1, f^{\\prime}(x)=0$ at $x \\quad 1$ and $f^{\\prime}(x)<0$ after $x \\quad 1$\nThus $f$ has relative maxima at $x=1$ and $f(1)=-1-6+9=4$.\nLet $x=3-\\varepsilon$, then\n\n$$\n(x-1)(x-3)=(3-\\varepsilon-1)(3-\\varepsilon-3)=(2-\\varepsilon)(-\\varepsilon)=-\\varepsilon(2-\\varepsilon)<0\n$$\n\nThat is $f^{\\prime}(x)<0$ before $x=3$.\nFor $x=3+\\varepsilon$\n\n$$\n(x-1)(x-3)=(3+\\varepsilon-1)(3+\\varepsilon-3)=(2+\\varepsilon)(\\varepsilon)>0\n$$\n\nThat is, $f^{\\prime}(x)>0$ after $x=3$.\nAs $f^{\\prime}(x)<0$ before $x=3, f^{\\prime}(x)$ at $x=3$ and $f^{\\prime}(x)>0$ after $x=3$,\nThus $f$ has relative minima at $x=3$. and $f(3)=3(3)^{2}-12(3)+9=0$\nSecond Method: $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)=3(2 x-4)=6(x-2)$\n\n$$\nf^{\\prime \\prime}(1)=6(1-2)=-6<0 \\text {, therefore, }\n$$\n\n$f$ has relative maxima at $x=1$ and $f(1)=(1)^{2}-6(1)^{2}+9(1)$\n\n$$\n=1-6+9=4\n$$\n\n$f^{\\prime \\prime}(3)=6(3-2)=6>0$, therefore $f$ has relative minima at $x=3$ and $f(3)=27-54+27=0$\n\nExample 2: Examine the function defined as $f(x)=1+x^{3}$ for extreme values\nSolution: Given that $f(x)=1+x^{3}$\nDifferentiating w.r.t.

Show that $y=x^{e}$ has a minimum value at $x=\\frac{1}{e}$.\n\n## Application of Maxima and Minima\n\nNow we apply the concept of maxima and minima to the practical problems. We first form the functional relation of the form $y=f(x)$ from the given information and find the maximum or minimum value of $f$ as required. Here we solve some examples relating to maxima and minima problems.\n\nExample 1: Find two positive integers whose sum is 9 and the product of one with the square of the other will be maximum.\n\nSolution: Let $x$ and $9-x$ be the two required positive integers such that\n\n$$\nx(9-x)^{2} \\text { will be maximum. }\n$$\n\nLet $f(x)=x(9-x)^{2}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf^{\\prime}(x) & =1 \\cdot(9-x)^{2}+x \\cdot 2(9-x) \\times(-1) \\\\\n& =(9-x)[9-x-2 x]=(9-x)(9-3 x)=3(9-x)(3-x) \\\\\nf^{\\prime}(x) & =0 \\Rightarrow 3(9-x)(3-x)=0 \\Rightarrow x=9 \\text { or } x=3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn this case $x=9$ is not possible because\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 9-x=9-9=0 \\text { which is not positive integer. } \\\\\n& f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)=3 \\frac{1}{(}-1)(3-x)+(9-x) \\times(-1) \\frac{1}{}=3 \\frac{1}{}-3+x-9+x \\frac{1}{}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n=3 \\frac{1}{2 x}-12 \\frac{1}{}=6(x-6)\n$$\n\nAs $f^{\\prime \\prime}(3)=6(3-6)=6(-3)=-18$ which is negative.\nThus $f(x)$ gives the maximum value if $x=3$, so the other positive integer is 6 because $9-3=6$.\n\nExample 2: What are the dimensions of a box of a square base having largest volume if the sum of one side of the base and its height is 12 cm .\n\nSolution: Let the length of one side of the base (in cm ) be $x$ and the height of the box (in cm ) be h , then $\\mathrm{V}=x^{2} h$\n\nIt is given that $x+h=12 \\quad \\Rightarrow h=12-x$\nThus $\\mathrm{V}=x^{2}(12-x)$ and\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{d V}{d x}= & 2 x(12-x)+x^{2}(-1)=24 x-3 x^{2}=3 x(8-x) \\\\\n& \\frac{d V}{d x}=0 \\Rightarrow 3 x(8-x)=0 . \\text { In this case } \\mathrm{x} \\text { cannot be zero, } \\\\\n\\text { so } \\quad & 8-x=0 \\Rightarrow x=8 . \\\\\n& \\frac{d^{2} V}{d x^{2}}=24-6 x \\text { which is negative for } x=8\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $V$ is maximum if $x=8(c m)$ and $h=12-8=4(c m)$\nExample 3: The perimeter of a triangle is 20 centimetres. If one side is of length 8 centimetres, what are lengths of the other two sides for maximum area of the triangle?\n\nSolution: Let the length of one unknown side (in cm ) be $x$, then the length of the other unknown side (in cm ) will be $20-x-8=12-x$.\n\nLet $y$ denote the square of the area of the triangle, then we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y=10(10-8)(10-x)(10-12+x) \\quad\\left(1 / x-\\frac{20}{2}-10 \\text { and area of the triangle } \\sqrt{x(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)}\\right) \\\\\n& =10.2(10-x)(x-2)=20\\left(-x^{2}+12 x-20\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{d y}{d x}=20(-2 x+12)=-40(x-6) \\\\\n& \\frac{d y}{d x}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow x=6\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs $\\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}$ is $-\\mathrm{ve}, \\mathrm{so} x=6$ gives the maximum area of the triangle.\nThe length of other unknown side $=12-6=6(\\mathrm{~cm})$\nThus the lengths of the other two sides are 6 cm and 6 cm .\nExample 4: An open box of rectangular base is to be made from 24 cm by 45 cm cardboard by cutting out square sheets of equal size from each corner and bending the sides. Find the dimensions of corner squares to obtain a box having largest possible volume.\n\nSolution: Let $x$ (in cm ) be the length of a side of each square sheet to be cut off from each comer of the cardboard. Then the length and breadth of the resulting box (in cm ) will be $45-2 x$ and $24-2 x$ respectively. Obviously the height of the box (in cm ) will be $x$. Thus the volume $V$ of the box (in cubic cm ) will be given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV & =x(24-2 x)(45-2 x)=2 x(12-x)(45-2 x) \\\\\n& =2 x\\left(540-69 x+2 x^{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand $\\quad \\frac{d V}{d x}=2\\left[1 .\\left(2 x^{2}-69 x+540\\right)+x(4 x-69)\\right]$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =2\\left(6 x^{2}-138 x+540\\right) \\\\\n= & 12\\left(x^{2}-23 x+90\\right)=12(x-5)(x-18) \\\\\n& \\frac{d V}{d x}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow 12(x-5)(x-18)=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow x=5 \\text { or } x=18 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow x=5[\\because \\text { if } x=18, \\text { then } 12-x=12-18=-6, \\text { that is, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$V$ is negative which is not possible]\n$\\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}=12(2 x-23)$\n$\\frac{d^{2} V}{d x^{2}}$ is negative for $x=5$ because $12(2 \\times 5-23)=12(-13)$\nThus V will be maximum if the length of a side of the corner square to be cut off is 5 cm .\nExample 5: Find the point on the graph of the curve $y=4-x^{2}$ which is closest to the point $(3,4)$.\n\nSolution: Let $l$ be distance between a point $(x, y)$ on the curve $y=4-x^{2}$ and the point $(3$, 4). Then $l=\\sqrt{(x-3)^{2}+(y-4)^{2}}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\sqrt{(x-3)^{2}+\\left(4-x^{2}-4\\right)^{2}} \\quad\\left(\\because(x, y) \\text { is on the curve } y=4-x^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sqrt{(x-3)^{2}+x^{4}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow we find $x$ for which $l$ is minimum.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{d l}{d x} & =\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{(x-3)^{2}+x^{4}}} \\cdot\\left[\\left(\\begin{array}{lll}\n2(x & 3 & 4 x^{2}\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2 l} \\cdot 2\\left(2 x^{2}+x-3\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\frac{1}{l}\\left(2 x^{2}+x-3\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{l}(x-1)\\left(2 x^{2}+x-3\\right) \\\\\n& \\frac{d l}{d x}=0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{l}(x-1)\\left(2 x^{2}+2 x+3\\right)=0 \\Rightarrow x-1=0 \\text { or } 2 x^{2}+2 x+3=0 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow x=1 \\quad\\left(\\because 2 x^{2}+2 x+3=0\\right) \\\\\n& l \\text { is positive for } 1-\\varepsilon \\text { and } 1+\\varepsilon \\text { where } \\varepsilon \\text { is very very small positive real number. } \\\\\n& \\text { Also } 2 x^{2}+2 x+3=2\\left(x^{2}+x+\\frac{1}{4}\\right)+\\frac{5}{2}=2\\left(x+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{5}{2} \\text { is positive, for } x=1-\\varepsilon \\\\\n& \\text { and } x=1+\\varepsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe sign of $\\frac{d l}{d x}$ depends on the factor $x-1$.\n$x-1$ is negative for $x=1-\\varepsilon$ because $x-1=1-\\varepsilon-1=-\\varepsilon \\quad \\ldots . .($ ii)\n$x-1$ is positive for $x=1+\\varepsilon$ because $x-1=1+\\varepsilon-1=\\varepsilon \\quad \\ldots .$. (ii)\nFrom (i) and (ii), we conclude that $\\frac{d l}{d x}$ changes sign from -ve to +ve at $x=1$.\nThus $l$ has a minimum value at $x=1$.\nPutting $x=1$ in $y=4-x^{2}$, we get the $y$-coordinate of the required point which is $4-(1)^{2}=3$\nHence the required point on the curve is $(1,3)$.\n\n## EXERCISE 2.10\n\n1.

The technique or method to find such a function whose derivative is given involves the inverse process of differentiation, called **anti-derivation** or **integration**. We use differentials of variables while applying method of substitution in integrating process. Before the further study of anti-derivation, we first discuss the differentials of variables.\n\n### 3.1.1 Differentials of Variables\n\nLet *f* be a differentiable function in the interval *a* < *x* < *b*, defined as *y* = *f*(*x*), then\n\n$$\n\\delta y = f(x + \\delta x) - f(x)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\lim_{d \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\delta y}{dx} = \\lim_{d \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x + \\delta x) - f(x)}{\\delta x} \\quad f'(x), \\text{ that is}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)\n$$\n\nWe know that before the limit is reached, $\\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}$ differs from *f*'(x) by a very small real number $\\varepsilon$.\n\nLet\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x} = f'(x) + \\varepsilon \\qquad \\text{where } \\varepsilon is very small\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\delta y = f'(x)\\delta x + \\varepsilon \\quad \\delta x \\qquad \\text{(i)}\n$$\n\nThe term $f'(x)\\delta x$ being more important than the term $\\varepsilon \\delta x$, is called the differential of the dependent variable *y* and is denoted by *dy* (or *df*)\n\nThus *dy* = $f'(x)\\delta x$ (ii)\n\nAs\n\n$$\ndx = (x)'\\delta x = (1)\\delta x, \\text{ so}\n$$\n\nthe differential of *x* is denoted by *dx* and is defined by the relation *dx* = $\\delta x$.\n\nThe equation (ii) becomes\n\n$$\ndy = f'(x) \\, dx \\qquad \\text{(iii)}\n$$\n\n**Note:** Instead of *dy*, we can write *df*, that is, *df* = *f*'(x) *dx* where *f*'(x) being coefficient of differential is called differential coefficient.\n\n### 3.1.2 Distinguishing Between *dy* and $\\delta y$\n\nThe tangent line is drawn to the graph of *y* = *f*(*x*) at *P*(*x*, *f*(*x*) and *MP* is the ordinate of *P*, that is, *MP* = *f*(*x*). (see Fig. 3.1)\n\nLet $\\delta x$ be small number, then the point *N* is located at *x* + $\\delta x$ on the *x*-axis. Let the vertical line through *N* cut the tangent line at *T* and the graph of *f* at *Q*. Then the point *Q* is (*x* + $\\delta x$, *f*(*x* + $\\delta x*)), so\n\n$$\nd x = \\delta x = PR\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\delta y = RQ = RT + TQ\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\tan \\varphi \\delta x + TQ \\qquad \\left( \\because \\tan \\varphi = \\frac{RT}{PR} \\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi$ is the angle which the tangent *PT* makes with the positive direction of the *x*-axis.\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\delta y = f'(x) dx + TQ \\qquad \\left( \\therefore \\tan \\varphi \\delta x = f'(x) \\right)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Rightarrow \\quad \\delta y = dy + TQ\n$$\n\nWe see that $\\delta y$ is the rise of *f* for a change $\\delta x$ in *x* at *x* where as *dy* is the rise of the tangent line at *P* corresponding to the same change $\\delta x$ in *x*.\n\nThe importance of the differential is obvious from the figure 3.1. As $\\delta x$ approaches 0, the value of *dy* gets closer and closer to that of $\\delta y$, so for small values of $\\delta x$,\n\n$$\ndy = \\delta y\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\ndy = f'(x) dx \\quad [\\because dy = f'(x) dx] \\qquad \\text{(iv)}\n$$\n\nWe know that\n\n$$\n\\delta y = f(x + \\delta x) - f(x) \\qquad \\text{ for } f(x + \\delta x) = f(x) + \\delta y\n$$\n\nBut\n\n$$\n\\delta y \\approx dy, \\text{ so}\n$$\n\n$$\nf(x + \\delta x) \\approx f(x) + dy \\qquad \\text{(v)}\n$$\n\n$$\nf(x + \\delta x) \\approx f(x) + f'(x) dx \\qquad \\text{(vi)}\n$$\n\nExample: Find $\\delta y$ and $d y$ of the function defined as $f(x)=x^{2}, \\quad$ when $x=2$ and $d x=0.01$\n\nSolution: As $f(x)=x^{2}$, so $f^{\\prime}(x)=2 x$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\delta y=f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)=(x+\\delta x)^{2}-x^{2} \\\\\n& =2 x \\delta x+(\\delta x)^{2}=2 x d x+(d x)^{2} \\quad(\\because \\delta x=d x) \\\\\n& \\text { Thus } f(2+0.01)-f(2)=2(2)(0.01)+(0.01)^{2} \\\\\n& =0.04+0.0001=0.0401 \\text {, that is } \\\\\n& \\delta y=0.0401 \\text { when } x=2 \\text { and } \\delta x=d x=0.01 \\\\\n& \\text { Also } d y=f^{\\prime}(x) d x \\\\\n& =2(2) \\times(0.01)=0.04 \\quad\\left(\\because f^{\\prime}(x)=2 x, x=2 \\text { and } d x=0.01\\right) \\\\\n& \\text { Thus } \\delta y-d y=0.0401-0.04=0.0001 \\text {. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### 3.1.3 Finding $\\frac{d y}{d x}$ by using differentials\n\nWe explain the process in the following example.\nExample: Using differentials find $\\frac{d y}{d x}$ when $\\frac{y}{x}-\\ln x=\\ln c$\nSolution: Finding differentials of both sides of the given equation, we get\n\n$$\nd\\left[\\frac{y}{x}-\\ln x\\right]=d[\\ln c]=0\n$$\n\nusing $d(f \\pm g)=d f \\pm d g$, we have\n\n$$\nd\\left[\\frac{y}{x}\\right]-d(\\ln x) \\gg 0 \\quad \\frac{d}{d x}\\left[y \\frac{1}{x}\\right] \\quad \\frac{1}{x} d x \\quad 0\n$$\n\nUsing $d(f g)=f d g+g d f$, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y d\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)+\\frac{1}{x} d y-\\frac{1}{x} d x=0 \\\\\n& y \\times\\left(\\frac{1}{x^{2}} d x\\right)+\\frac{1}{x} d y-\\frac{1}{x} d x=0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{x} d y=\\frac{1}{x} d x+\\frac{y}{x^{2}} d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { or } \\quad \\frac{1}{x} d y=\\left(\\frac{1}{x} \\quad \\frac{y}{x^{2}}\\right) d x \\quad\\left(\\frac{x+y}{x^{2}}\\right) d x \\quad \\frac{1}{x}\\left(\\frac{x+y}{x}\\right) d x \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow d y=\\left(\\frac{x+y}{x}\\right) d x \\\\\n& \\text { Thus } \\quad \\frac{d y}{d x}=\\frac{x+y}{x} \\quad\\left[\\because d y=f^{\\prime}(x) d x\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### 3.1.4 Simple application of differentials\n\nUse of differentials for approximation is explained in the following examples.\nExample 1: Use differentials to approximate the value of $\\sqrt{17}$.\nSolution: Let $f(x)=\\sqrt{x}$\nThen $f(x+\\delta x)=\\sqrt{x+\\delta x}$\nAs the nearest perfect square root to 17 is 16 , so we take $x=16$\nand $\\delta x=d x=1$\nThen $y=f(16)=\\sqrt{16}=4$\nUsing $f(x+\\delta x) \\approx f(x)+d y$\n\n$$\n\\approx f(x)+f^{\\prime}(x) d x \\text {. we have }\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(16+1) & \\approx f(16)+\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{16}} \\times(1) \\quad\\left(\\because f^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{x}}\\right) \\\\\n& \\approx 4+\\frac{1}{2 \\times 4}=4+\\frac{1}{8}=4.125\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence $\\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.125$\nExample 2: Use differentials to approximate the value of $\\sqrt[3]{8.6}$\nSolution: Let $f(x)=\\sqrt[3]{x} \\quad$ then\n\n$$\ny+\\delta y=f(x+\\delta x)=\\sqrt[3]{x+\\delta x}=\\sqrt[3]{x+d x} \\quad(\\because \\delta x=d x) \\text { and } f^{\\prime}(x) \\frac{1}{3 x^{3}}\n$$\n\nAs the nearest perfect cube root to 8.6 is 8 , so we take $x=8$ and $d x=0.6$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f(8)=\\sqrt[3]{8}=2 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f^{\\prime}(8)=\\frac{1}{3(8)^{2}} \\quad \\frac{1}{3 \\times 4} \\quad \\frac{1}{12} \\\\\n& \\text { so } \\quad d y=f^{\\prime}(x) d x=\\frac{1}{12} \\times(0.6)=0.05 \\\\\n& \\text { Using } f(x+\\delta x)=f(x)+d y \\text {, we have } \\\\\n& f(8+0.6)=f(8)+0.05 \\\\\n& \\quad \\neq 2 \\quad 0.05 \\quad 2.05\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBut using calculator, we find that $\\sqrt[3]{8.6}$ is approximately equal to 2.0488 .\n\n## Example 3: Using differentials, find the approximate value of $\\sin 46^{\\circ}$\n\nSolution: Let $y=\\sin x$, then\n\n$$\ny+\\delta y=\\sin (x+\\delta x)=\\sin (x+d x) \\quad(\\delta x=d x)\n$$\n\nWe take $x=45^{\\circ}=\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\quad$ and $d x=1^{\\circ} \\quad=0.01745$\n\n$$\n\\text { Hence } d y=\\cos x d x \\quad\\left(-\\frac{d}{d x}(\\sin x)=\\cos x\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\approx\\left(\\cos 45^{\\circ}\\right)(0.01745)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(0.01745) \\\\\n& \\approx 0.7071(0.01745) \\\\\n& \\approx 0.01234 \\\\\n& \\text { Using } f(x+\\delta x) \\approx f(x)+d y \\text { we have } \\\\\n& \\sin \\left(46^{\\circ}\\right) \\approx \\sin 45^{\\circ}+d y \\approx 0.7071+0.01234=0.71944 \\\\\n& \\approx 0.7194\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing calculator, we find $\\sin 46^{\\circ}$ is approximately equal to 0.71934 .\nExample 4: The side of a cube is measured to be 20 cm with a maximum error of 12 cm in its measurement. Find the maximum error in the calculated volume of the cube.\n\nSolution: Let $x$ be the side and $V$ be the volume of the cube, then\n\n$$\nV=x^{3} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad d V=\\left(3 x^{2}\\right) d x\n$$\n\nTaking $x=20(\\mathrm{~cm})$ and $d x=0.12(\\mathrm{~cm})$, we get\n\n$$\nd V=[3(20)^{2}](0.12)=1200 x(0.12)=144(\\text { cubic } \\mathrm{cm})\n$$\n\nThe error 144 cubic cm in volume calculation of a cube is either positive or negative.\n\n## EXERCISE 3.1\n\n1.

Now we consider the reverse (or inverse) process i.e. we find a function when its derivative is known. In other words we can say that if $\\phi^{\\prime}(x)=f(x)$, then $\\phi(x)$ is called an anti-derivative or an integral of $f(x)$. For example, an anti-derivative of $f(x)=3 x^{2}$ is $\\phi(x)=x^{3}$ because $\\phi^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(x^{3}\\right)=3 x^{2}=f(x)$.\n\nThe inverse process of differentiation i.e. the process of finding such a function whose derivative is given is called anti-differentiation or integration.\n\nWhile finding the derivatives of the expressions such as $x^{2}+x, x^{2}+x+5, x^{2}+x-3$ etc., we see that the derivative of each of them is $2 x+1$, that is,\n$\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(x^{2}+x\\right)=\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(x^{2}+x+5\\right)=\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(x^{2}+x-3\\right)=2 x+1$\nNow if $f(x)=2 x+1$\nThen $\\phi(x)=x^{2}+x$\nis not only anti-derivative of (i). But all anti-derivatives of $f(x)=2 x+1$ are included in $x^{2}+x+c$ where $c$ is the arbitrary constant which can be found if further information is given. As $c$ is not definite, so $\\phi(x)+c$ is called the indefinite integral of $f(x)$, that is,\n$\\int f(x) d x=\\Phi(x)+c$\nIn (ii), $f(x)$ is called integrand and $c$ is named as the constant of integration.\nThe symbol $\\int \\ldots d x$ indicates that integrand is to be integrated w.r.t. $x$.\nNote that $\\frac{d}{d x}$ and $\\int \\ldots d x$ are inverse operations of each other.\n\n### 3.2.1 Some Standard Formulae for Anti-Derivatives\n\nWe give below a list of standard formulae for anti-derivatives which can be obtained from the corresponding formulae for derivatives:\n\n## General

have already discussed in section 3.2 about the indefinite integral that is, if $\\phi^{\\prime}(x)=$ $f(x)$, then\n\n$$\n\\int f(x) d x=\\phi(x)+c \\text {, where } c \\text { is an arbitrary constant }\n$$\n\nIf $\\int f(x) d x=\\phi(x)+c$, then the integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$ is denoted by $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x$ (read as\nintergral from $a$ to $b$ of $f$ of $x, d x$ ) and is evaluated as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x & =\\int_{a}^{b} \\phi^{\\prime}(x) d x \\quad \\text { (if } f(x)=\\phi^{\\prime}(x)) \\\\\n& =\\left|\\phi(x)+c\\right|_{a}^{b}=[\\phi(b)+c]-[\\phi(a)+c]=\\phi(b)-\\phi(a)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x$ has a definite value $\\phi(b)-\\phi(a)$, so it is called the definite integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$. $\\phi(b)-\\phi(a)$ is denoted as $[\\phi(x)]_{a}^{b}$ or $\\phi(x)]_{a}^{b}$ (read $\\phi(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ )\n\nThe interval $[a, b]$ is called the range of integration while $a$ and $b$ are known as the lower and upper limits respectively.\n\nAs $\\phi(b)-\\phi(a)$ is a definite value, so the variable of integration $x$ in $\\int f(x) d x$ can be replaced by any other letter.\ni.e. $\\int f(x) d x=\\int f(t) d t=\\phi(b)-\\phi(a)$\n\nNote: If the lower limit is a constant and the upper limit is a variable, then the integral is a function of the upper limit, that is, $\\int f(t) d t=|\\phi(t)|_{a}^{b}=\\phi(x)-\\phi(a)$\n\nFor Example, $\\int \\frac{1}{2} 3 t^{2} d t=\\left[t^{2}\\right]_{a}^{b}=x^{3}-a^{3}$\nThe relation $\\phi^{\\prime}(x)=f(x)$ shows that $f(x)$ gives the rate of change of $\\phi(x)$, so the total change in $\\phi(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ as $\\phi(b)-\\phi(a)$ shows the connection between anti-derivatives and definite integral $\\int f(x) d x$.\n\n### 3.6.1 The Area Under The Curve\n\nAbout 300 B.C. and around this, mathematicians succeeded to find area of plane region like triangle, rectangle, trapezium and regular polygons etc. but the area of the complicated region bounded by the curves and the $x$-axis from $x=a$ to $x=b$ was a challenge for mathematicians before the invention of integral calculus.\n\nNow we give attention to the use of integration for evaluating areas. Suppose that a function $f$ is continuous on interval $a \\leq x \\leq b$ and $f(x)>0$. To determine the area under the graph of $f$ and above the $x$-axis from $x=a$ to $x=b$, we follow the idea of Archimedes (287-212 B.C.) for approximating the function by horizontal functions and the area under $f$ by the sum of small rectangles.\n\nTo explain the idea mentioned above, we first draw the graph of $f$ defined as: $f(x)=\\frac{1}{2} x^{2}$\n\nThe graph of $f$ is shown in the figure. We divide the interval $[1,3]$ into four sub-intervals of equal length $=\\frac{3-1}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nAs the subintervals are\n$\\left[x_{0}, x_{1}\\right],\\left[x_{1}, x_{2}\\right],\\left[x_{2}, x_{3}\\right],\\left[x_{3}, x_{4}\\right]$, so\n$x_{0}=1, x_{1}=1.5, x_{2}=2, x_{3}=2.5, x_{4}=3$\nIn the figure $M A=f\\left(x_{0}\\right), N B=f\\left(x_{1}\\right)$ and $M N=\\delta x$, so it\nis obvious that the area of the rectangle $A M N C<$ the area of the shaded region $A M N B<$ area of the rectangle $D M N B$, that is,\n$f\\left(x_{0}\\right) \\delta x<$ area of the shaded region $A M N B<f\\left(x_{1}\\right) \\delta x$\nLet $\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{1}, \\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{2}, \\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{3}, \\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{4}$ be the mid point of four subintervals mentioned above.\n\nThen the value of $f$ at $\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{1}$, is $f\\left(\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{1}\\right)$, so the area of the rectangle $F M N E=f\\left(\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{1}\\right) \\delta x$\n(See the rectangle $F M N E$ shown in the figure)\nWe observe that the area of the rectangle $F M N E$ is approximately equal to the area of the region $A M N B$ under the graph of $f$ from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$.\nNow we calculate the sum of areas of the rectangles shown in the figure, that is, $f\\left(\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{1}\\right) \\delta x+f\\left(\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{2}\\right) \\delta x+f\\left(\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{3}\\right) \\delta x+f\\left(\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{4}\\right) \\delta x$\n\n$$\n=\\left[f\\left(\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{1}\\right)+f\\left(\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{3}\\right)+f\\left(\\stackrel{\\circ}{x}_{4}\\right)\\right] \\delta x\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x_{0}+x_{1}}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x_{2}+x_{3}}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x_{3}+x_{4}}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\left(\\frac{1+1.5}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1.5+2}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{2+2.5}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{2.5+3}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\left(1.25\\right)^{2}+\\left(1.75\\right)^{2}+\\left(2.25\\right)^{2}+\\left(2.75\\right)^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{4}\\left(1.5625+3.0625+5.0625+7.5625\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{4}(17.25)=4.3125\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBut $\\int \\frac{1}{2} x^{2} d x=\\left[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x^{2}}{3}\\right]_{1}^{3}=\\frac{1}{6}(27-1)=\\frac{26}{6}=4.3$\nIf we go on increasing the number of intervals, then the sum of areas of small rectangles approaches closer to the number 4.3.\n\nIf we divide the interval $[1,3]$ into $n$ intervals and take $x_{i}$ the coordinate of any point of the $i$ th interval and $\\delta x_{i}=x_{i}-x_{i-1}, i=1,2,3, \\ldots, n$, then the sum of areas of $n$ rectangles is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f\\left(x_{i}\\right) \\delta x$ which tends to the number 4.3 when $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ and each $\\delta x_{i} \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nThus $\\lim _{\\substack{x \\rightarrow \\infty \\\\ x_{i} \\rightarrow 0}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f\\left(x_{i}\\right) \\delta x_{i}=4.3$ and we conclude that\n\n$$\n\\lim _{\\substack{x \\rightarrow \\infty \\\\ x_{i} \\rightarrow 0}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f\\left(x_{i}\\right) \\delta_{i} x=\\int_{1}^{3} \\frac{1}{2} x^{2} d x\n$$\n\nThus the area above the $x$-axis and under the curve $y=f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is the definite integral $\\int f(x) d x$.\n\nConsider a function $f$ which is continuous on the interval $a \\leq x \\leq b$ and $f(x)>0$. The graph of $f$ is shown in the figure.\nWe define the function $A(x)$ as the area above the $x$-axis and under the curve $y=f(x)$ from $a$ to $x$. Let $\\delta x$ be a small positive number and $x+\\delta x$ be any number in the interval $[a, b]$ such that $a<x<x+\\delta x$.\n\nLet $P\\left(x, f(x)\\right)$ and $Q(x+\\delta x, f(x+b x))$ be two points on the graph of $f$. The ordinates $P M$ and $Q N$ are drawn and two rectangles $P M N R, S M N Q$ are completed.\n\nAccording to above definition, the area above the $x$-axis and under the curve $y=f(x)$ from $a$ to $x+\\delta x$\nis $A(x+\\delta x)$, so the change in area is\n$A(x+\\delta x)-A(x)$ which is shaded in the figure\nNote that the function $f$ is increasing in the interval $\\left[x, x+\\delta x\\right]$.\nFrom the figure, it is obvious that area of the rectangle $P M N R<A(x+\\delta x)-A(x)<$ area of the rectangle $S M N Q$, i.e.,\n\n$$\nf(x) \\delta x<A(x+\\delta x)-A(x)<f(x+\\delta x) \\delta x\n$$\n\nDividing the inequality by $\\delta x$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f(x)<\\frac{A(x+\\delta x)-A(x)}{d x}<f(x+\\delta x) \\\\\n& \\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} f(x)=f(x) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} f(x+\\delta x)=f(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince the limits of the extremes in (I) are equal, so\n\n$$\n\\frac{A(x+\\delta x)-A(x)}{\\delta x} \\longrightarrow f(x) \\quad \\text { when } \\delta x \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nThus $\\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{A(x+\\delta x)-A(x)}{\\delta x}=f(x)$.\nor\n\n$$\nA^{+}(x)=f(x)\n$$\n\nthat is, $A(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f$, so $\\int f(x) d x=A(x)+c$\nand $\\int f(x) d x=[A(x)]_{a}^{c}=A(x)-A(a)$\n\nSince $A(x)$ is defined as the area under the curve $y=f(x)$ from $a$ to $x$, so $A(a)=0$\nThus\n\n$$\nA(x)=\\int f(x) d x\n$$\n\nPutting $x=b$ in the equation (I), gives\n\n$$\nA(b)=\\int f(x) d x\n$$\n\nwhich shows that the area $A$ of the region, above the $x$-axis and under the curve $y=f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is given by\n$\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x$, that is, $A=\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x$\nIf the graph of $f$ is entirely below the $x$-axis, then the value of each $f\\left(x_{i}\\right)$ is negative and each product $f\\left(x_{i}\\right) d x_{i}$, is also negative, so in such a case, the definite integral is negative.\n\nThus the area, bounded in this case by the curve $y=f(x)$, the $x$-axis and the lines $x=a, x=b$ is $-\\int f(x) d x$.\n\nFor example, $\\sin x$ is negative for $-\\pi<x<0$ and is positive for $0<x<\\pi$.\n\nTherefore the area bounded by the $x$-axis and graph of $\\sin$ function from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n-\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\sin x & d x+\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin x d x=\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin x d x+\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin x d x\\left[\\cup \\int_{\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) d x=\\int_{0}^{\\pi} f(x) d x\\right] \\\\\n& =[-\\cos x]_{0}^{-\\pi}+[-\\cos x]_{0}^{\\pi}=-\\left[\\cos (-\\pi)-\\cos 0\\right]+[-(\\cos \\pi-\\cos 0)] \\\\\n& =-[(-1)-1]-[(-1)-1]=2+2=4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## Note:\n\n$\\int \\sin x d x=\\int \\cos x]_{0}^{-\\pi}-\\int \\cos \\pi-\\cos (\\pi)-\\int(-1) \\geq 0$\n\n### 3.6.2 Fundamental Theorem and Properties of Definite Integrals\n\nThe Definite integral $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x$\ngives the area under the curve $y=f(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$ and the $x$-axis (proof is given in the article 3.6.1)\n\n## (b) Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n\nIf $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $\\phi^{\\prime}(x)=f(x)$, that is,\n$\\phi(x)$ is any anti-derivative of $f$ on $[a, b]$, then\n\n$$\n\\int f(x) d x=\\phi(b)-\\phi(a)\n$$\n\nNote that the difference $\\phi(b)-\\phi(a)$ is independent of the choice of anti-derivative of the function $f$.\n(c) $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x=-\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x$\n(d) $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x=\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x+\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x, \\quad a \\quad c \\quad b$\n\n## Proof of (c) and (d):\n\n(c) If $\\phi^{\\prime}(x)=f(x)$, that is, if $\\phi$ is an anti-derivative of $f$, then using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we get\n\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x=\\phi(b)-\\phi(a)=-[\\phi(a)-\\phi(b)]=-\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x\n$$\n\n(d) If $\\phi^{\\prime}(x)=f(x)$, that is, if $\\phi(x)$ is an anti-derivative of $f(x)$, then applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have\n\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x=\\phi(c) \\quad \\phi(a) \\text { and } \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x \\quad \\phi(b) \\quad \\phi(c)\n$$\n\nThus $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x+\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x=\\phi(c)-\\phi(a)+\\phi(b)-\\phi(c)$\n\n$$\n=\\phi(b)-\\phi(c)=\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x\n$$\n\nOther properties of definite integrals can easily be proved by applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\nNow we evaluate some definite integrals in the following examples.\nExample 1: $\\quad$ Evaluate (i) $\\quad \\int_{a}^{b}\\left(x^{3}+3 x^{4}\\right) d x \\quad$ (ii) $\\quad \\frac{1}{2}

$x$-axis.\nExample 1. Find the area bounded by the curve $y=4-x^{2}$ and the $x$-axis.\n\nSolution: We first find the points where the curve cuts the $x$-axis. Putting $y=0$, we have\n$4-x^{2}=0 \\Rightarrow x= \\pm 2$.\nSo the curve cuts the $x$-axis at $(-2,0)$ and $(2,0)$\nThe area above the $x$-axis and under the curve $y=4-x^{2}$ is\nshown in the figure as shaded region..\n\nThus the required area $=\\int(4-x) d x=[4 x--]$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\left(4(2)-\\frac{(2)^{2}}{3}\\right)-\\left(4(-2)-\\frac{(-2)^{2}}{3}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(8-\\frac{8}{3}\\right)-\\left(-8+\\frac{8}{3}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{16}{3}\\left(\\frac{-16}{3}\\right) \\quad \\frac{32}{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 2. Find the area bounded by the curve $y=x^{3}+3 x^{2}$ and the $x$-axis.\nSolution: Putting $y=0$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^{3}+3 x^{2} & =0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^{2}(x+3) & =0 \\Rightarrow x=0, x=-3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe curve cuts the $x$-axis at $(-3,0)$ and $(0,0)$ (see the figure).\n\nThus the required area $=\\int_{-3}^{0}\\left(x^{3}+3 x^{2}\\right) d x$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\left[\\frac{x^{4}}{4}+x^{2}\\right]_{-3}^{0} \\\\\n& =\\left(\\frac{0}{4}+0\\right)-\\left(\\frac{(-3)^{4}}{4}+(-3)^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& =0-\\left(\\frac{81}{4}-27\\right)=-\\left(\\frac{81-108}{4}\\right)=-\\left(-\\frac{27}{4}\\right)=\\frac{27}{4}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 3. Find the area bounded by $y=x\\left(x^{3}-4\\right)$ and the $x$-axis.\nSolution: Putting $y=0$, we have\n\n$$\nx\\left(x^{3}-4\\right) \\Rightarrow x=0, x= \\pm 2\n$$\n\nThe curve cuts the $x$-axis at $(-2,0),(0,0)$ and $(2,0)$. The graph of $f$ is shown in the figure and we have to calculate the area of the shaded region.\n\n$$\nf(x)=x\\left(x^{2}-4\\right)\n$$\n\n$f(x) \\geq 0$ for $-2 \\leq x \\leq 0$, that is, the area in the interval $[-2,0]$ is above the $x$-axis and is equal to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{0}^{x} x\\left(x^{2}-4\\right) d x \\\\\n& =\\int_{-2}^{0}\\left(x^{3} \\quad 4 x\\right) d x=\\left|\\frac{x^{4}}{4} \\quad 4\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{2}\\right)\\right|_{-2}^{0}=-\\left[\\frac{x^{4}}{4} \\quad 2 x^{2}\\right]_{-2}^{0} \\\\\n& =0-\\left(\\frac{(-2)^{4}}{4}-2(-2)^{2}\\right)=0-\\left(\\frac{16}{4}-8\\right)=-(4-8)=4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$f(x) \\leq 0$ for $0 \\leq x \\leq 2$, that is, the area in the interval $[0,2]$ is below the $x$-axis and is equal to $-\\int_{0}^{x}\\left(x^{2}-4\\right) d x \\ll\\left[\\frac{x^{4}}{4} \\quad 2 x^{2}\\right]_{0}^{2}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\left[\\left(\\frac{16}{4} \\quad 2(4)\\right) \\quad 0\\right] \\\\\n& =-[-4-8]=-(-4)=4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus the area of the shaded region $=4+4=8$\nExample 4: Find the area bounded by the curve $f(x)=x^{3}-2 x^{2}+1$ and the $x$-axis in the 1st quadrant.\n\nSolution: As $f(1)=1-2+1=0$, so $x-1$ is factor of $x^{3}-2 x^{2}+1$. By long division, we find that $x^{2}-x-1$ is also a factor of $x^{3}-2 x^{2}+1$.\n\nSolving $x^{2}-x-1=0$, we get\n\n$$\nx=\\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+4}}{2}=\\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n$$\n\nThus the curve cuts the $x$-axis at $x=1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\n\nThe graph of the curve is shown in the adjoining figure and the required area is shaded.\nThe required area $A$ will be\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA & =\\int_{0}^{A}\\left(x^{2}-2 x^{2}+1\\right) d x \\\\\n& =\\left|\\frac{x^{4}}{4}-2 \\frac{x^{2}}{3}+x\\right|_{0} \\\\\n& =\\left(\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{2}{3}+1\\right)-0=\\frac{3-8+12}{12}=\\frac{7}{12}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 5: Find the area between the $x$-axis and the curve $y^{2}=4-x$ in the first quadrant from $x=0$ to $x=3$.\n\nSolution: The branch of the curve above the $x$-axis is\n\n$$\ny=\\sqrt{4-x}\n$$\n\nThe area to be determined is shaded in the adjoining figure.\nThus the required area $=\\int_{0}^{1} \\sqrt{4-x} d x$\nLet $4-x=t$ (i), then $-d x=d t \\Rightarrow d x=-d t$\nPutting $x=0$ and $x=3$ (i), we get $t=4$ and $t=1$\nNow the required area $=\\int_{t}^{1} t^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\times(-d t)=-\\int_{t}^{1} t^{\\frac{1}{2}} d t$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\int_{t}^{4} t^{\\frac{1}{2}} d t=\\left|\\frac{t^{0.5}}{3 / 2}\\right|_{0}^{4} \\\\\n& =\\frac{2}{3}\\left|t^{0.5}\\right|_{0}^{4}=\\frac{2}{3}\\left[(4)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\quad(1)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right] \\quad \\frac{2}{3}[8 \\quad 4] \\quad \\frac{14}{3} \\text { (square units) }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## EXERCISE 3.7\n\n1.

A differential equation containing only derivative of first order can be written in terms of differentials. So we can write the equation (i) as $y d y+2 x d x=0$ but the equation (ii) cannot be written in terms of differentials.\n\nOrder: The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative in the equation. As the order of the equation (i) is one so it is called a first order differential equation. But equation (ii) contains the second order derivative and is called a second order differential equation.\n\n### 3.8.1 Solution of a Differential Equation of first order:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Consider the equation } \\\\\n& y=A x^{2}+4 \\\\\n& \\text { where } A \\text { is a real constant } \\\\\n& \\text { Differentiating (iii) with respect to } x \\text { gives } \\\\\n& \\qquad \\frac{d y}{d x}=2 A x \\\\\n& \\text { (iv) }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom (iii) $A=\\frac{y-4}{x^{2}}$, so putting the value of $A$ in (iv), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{d y}{d x}=2\\left(\\frac{y-4}{x^{2}}\\right) x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad & x \\frac{d y}{d x}=2 y-8 \\text { which is free of constant } A \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad & 2 y-x \\frac{d y}{d x}=8\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the value of $y$ and its derivative in (v), we see that it is satisfied, that is.\n$2\\left(A x^{2}+4\\right)-x(2 A x)=2 A x^{2}+8-2 A x^{2}=8$\nwhich shows that (iii) is asolution of (v)\nGiving a particular value to $A$. say $A=-1$. we get\n\n$$\ny=-x^{2}+4\n$$\n\nWe see that (v) is satisfied if we put $y=-x^{2}+4$ and $\\frac{d y}{d x}=-2 x$, so $y=-x^{2}+4$ is also a solution of (v).\n\nFor different values of $A$, (iii) represents different parabolas with vertex at $(0,4)$ and the axis along the $y$-axis. We have drawn two members of the family of parabolas.\n\n$$\ny=A x^{2}+4 \\quad \\text { for } \\quad A=-1,1\n$$\n\nAll solutions obtained from (iii) by putting different values of $A$, are called particular solutions of (v) while the solution (iii) itself is called the general solution of (v).\n\nA solution of differential equation is a relation between the variables (not involving derivatives) which satisfies the differential equation.\n\nHere we shall solve differential equations of first order with variables separable in the forms\n\n$$\n\\frac{d y}{d x}=\\frac{f(x)}{g(y)} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\frac{d y}{d x}=\\frac{g(y)}{f(x)}\n$$\n\nExample 1: Solve the differential equation $(x-1) d x+y d y=0$\nSolution: Variables in the given equation are in separable form, so integrating either terms, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\int(x-1) d x+\\int y d y=c_{1}, \\quad \\text { where } c_{1} \\text { is a constant } \\\\\n\\text { or }\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{2}-x\\right)+\\frac{y^{2}}{2}=c_{1}, \\quad \\text { which gives }\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThus the required general solution is $x^{2}+y^{2}-2 x=c, \\quad$ where $c=2 c_{1}$\nExample 2: Solve differential equation\n\n$$\nx^{2}(2 y+1) \\frac{d y}{d x}-1=0\n$$\n\nSolution: The given differential equation can be written as\n\n$$\nx^{2}(2 y+1) \\frac{d y}{d x}=1\n$$\n\nDividing by $x^{2}$, we have $(2 y+1) \\frac{d y}{d x}=\\frac{1}{x^{2}}, \\quad(x \\neq 0)$\nMultiplying both sides of (i) by $d x$, we get\n\n$$\n(2 y+1)\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x} d x\\right)=\\frac{1}{x^{2}} d x\n$$\n\nor $\\quad(2 y+1) d y=\\frac{1}{x^{2}} d x \\quad\\left(\\because \\frac{d y}{d x} d x=d y\\right)$\nIntegrating either side gives\n\n$$\n\\int(2 y+1) d y=\\int \\frac{1}{x^{2}} d x\n$$\n\nor $\\quad y^{2}+y=-\\frac{1}{x}+c \\quad\\left(\\because \\int x^{-2} d x=\\frac{x^{-1}}{-1}+c\\right)$\nThus $y^{2}+y=c-\\frac{1}{x}$ is the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n## Example 3: Solve the differential equation\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x} \\frac{d y}{d x}-2 y=0 \\quad x \\neq 0, y>0\n$$\n\nSolution: Multiplying the both sides of the given equation by $\\frac{x}{y} d x$, gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{y}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x} d x\\right)-2 x d x=0 \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\frac{1}{y} d y \\quad 2 x d x \\quad\\left(\\because \\frac{d y}{d x} d x \\quad d y\\right)\n$$\n\nNow integrating either side gives $\\ln y=x^{2}+c_{1} \\quad$ where $c_{1}$ is a constant\nor $y=\\mathrm{e}^{x^{2}+c_{1}}=\\mathrm{e}^{x^{2}} \\cdot e^{x_{1}}$\nThus

social sciences.\n\nThe arbitrary constants involving the solution of different equations can be determined by the given conditions. Such conditions are called **initial value conditions**.\n\nThe general solution of differential equations in variable separable form contains only one variable. Here we shall consider those differential equations which have only one initial value condition.\n\nNote that the general solution of differential equations of order *n* contains *n* arbitrary constants which can be determined by *n* initial value conditions.\n\n**Example 1:** The slope of the tangent at any point of the curve is given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x - 2, \\text{ find the equation of the curve if } y = 0 \\text{ when } x = -1.\n$$\n\n**Solution:** Given that\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x - 2\n$$\n\n(i)\n\nEquation (i) can be written as\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = (2x - 2) \\, dx\n$$\n\n(ii)\n\nIntegrating either side of (ii) gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{(2x - 2)}{dx}\n$$\n\n(iii)\n\nApplying the given condition, we have\n\n$$\n0 = (-1)^2 - 2(-1) + c \\Rightarrow c = -3\n$$\n\nThus (iii) becomes\n\n$$\ny = x^2 - 2x - 3\n$$\n\nwhich represents a parabola as shown in the adjoining figure.\n\nFor *c* = 0, (iii) becomes\n\n$$\ny = x^2 - 2x\n$$\n\nThe graph of\n\n$$\ny = x^2 - 2x\n$$\n\nis also shown in the figure.\n\n**Note:** The general solution represents a system of parabolas which are vertically above or below each other.\n\n**Example 2:** Solve\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3}{4}x^4 + x - 3, \\text{ if } y = 0 \\text{ when } x = 2\n$$\n\n**Solution:** Given that\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3}{4}x^2 + x - 3\n$$\n\n(i)\n\nSeparating variables, we have\n\n$$\ndy = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}x^2 + x - 3\\right) dx\n$$\n\n(ii)\n\nIntegrating either side of (ii) gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3}{4}x^2 + x - 3\n$$\n\n(iii)\n\nWe have\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3}{4}x^2 + x - 3\n$$\n\nWe apply the initial value condition, we have\n\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{4}(8) + \\frac{1}{2}(4) - 3(2) + c\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = 6 - 2 - 2 = 2\n$$\n\nThus (iii) becomes\n\n$$\ny = \\frac{1}{4}x^3 + \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 3x + 2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = 4y = x^2 + 2x^2 - 12x + 8\n$$\n\n**Example 3:** A particle is moving in a straight line and its acceleration is given by\n\n$$\na = 2t - 7\n$$\n\n(i) Find *v* (velocity) in terms of *t* if *v* = 10 m/sec, when *t* = 0\n(ii) Find *s* (distance) in terms of *t* if *s* = 0, when *t* = 0.\n\nSolution: Given that $a=2 t-7$, that is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{d v}{d t}=2 t \\quad 7=\\left(\\because a \\quad \\frac{d v}{d t}\\right) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & d v=(2 t-7) d t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIntegrating, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int d v=\\int(2 t-7) d t \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & v=t^{2}-7 t+c_{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nApplying the first initial value condition, we get\n\n$$\n10=0-0+c_{1} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c_{1}=10\n$$\n\nThe equation (1) becomes\n\n$$\nv=t^{2}-7 t+10 \\quad \\text { which is the solution of (i) }\n$$\n\nNow $\\frac{d s}{d t}=t^{3}-7 t+10 \\quad\\left(\\because v=\\frac{d s}{d t}\\right)$\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad d s=\\left(t^{2}-7 t+10\\right) d t$\nIntegrating both sides of (2), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int d s=\\int\\left(t^{3}-7 t+10\\right) d t \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & s=\\frac{t^{3}}{3}-7 \\frac{t^{2}}{2}+10 t+c_{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nApplying the second initial value condition, gives\n\n$$\n0=0-0+0+c_{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow c_{2}=0\n$$\n\nThus is $\\quad s=\\frac{1}{3} t^{3}-\\frac{7}{2} t^{2}+10 t \\quad$ the solution of (ii)\nExample 4: In a culture, bacteria increases at the rate proportional to the number of bacteria present.

          "title": "Introduction to Analytic Geometry\n\n## 4.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nGeometry is one of the most ancient branches of mathematics. The Greeks systematically studied it about four centuries B.C. Most of the geometry taught in schools is due to Euclid who expounded thirteen books on the subject ( 300 B.C.). A French philosopher and $m$ athematician Rene Descartes (1596-1650 A.D.) introduced algebraic methods in geometry which gave birth to analytical geometry (or coordinate geometry). Our aim is to present fundamentals of the subject in this book.\n\n## Coordinate System\n\nDraw in a plane two mutually perpendicular number lines $x^{\\prime} x$ and $y^{\\prime} y$, one horizontal and the other vertical. Let their point of intersection be $O$, to which we call the origin and the real number 0 of both the lines is represented by $O$. The two lines are called the coordinate axes. The horizontal line $x^{\\prime} O x$ is called the $\\boldsymbol{x}$-axis and the vertical line $y^{\\prime} O y$ is called the $\\boldsymbol{y}$-axis.\n\nAs in the case of number line, we follow the convention that all points on the $y$-axis above $x^{\\prime} O x$ are associated with positive real numbers, those below $x^{\\prime} O x$ with negative real numbers. Similarly, all points on the $x$-axis and lying on the right of $O$ will be positive and those on the left of $O$ and lying on the $x$-axis will be negative.\n\nSuppose $P$ is any point in the plane. Then $\\boldsymbol{P}$ can be located by using an ordered pair of real numbers. Through $P$ draw lines parallel to the coordinates axes meeting $x$-axis at $R$ and $y$-axis at $S$.\nLet the directed distance $\\overline{O R}=x$ and the directed distance $\\overline{O S}=y$.\nThe ordered pair $(x, y)$ gives us enough information to locate the point $P$. Thus, with every point $P$ in the plane, we can associate an ordered pair of real numbers $(x, y)$ and we say\nversion: 1.1\nthat $P$ has coordinates $(x, y)$. It may be noted that $x$ and $y$ are the directed distances of $P$ from the $y$-axis and the $x$-axis respectively. The reverse of this technique also provides method for associating exactly one point in the plane with any ordered pair $(x, y)$ of real numbers. This method of pairing off in a one-to-one fashion the points in a plane with ordered pairs of real numbers is called the two dimensional rectangular (or Cartesian) coordinate system.\n\nIf $(x, y)$ are the coordinates of a point $P$, then the first member (component) of the ordered pair is called the $\\boldsymbol{x}$-coordinate or abscissa of $P$ and the second member of the ordered pair is called the $\\boldsymbol{y}$-coordinate or ordinate of $P$. Note that abscissa is always first element and the ordinate is second element in an ordered pair.\nThe coordinate axes divide the plane into four equal parts called quadrants. They are defined as follows:\n\nQuadrant I: All points $(x, y)$ with $x>0, y>0$\nQuadrant II: All points $(x, y)$ with $x<0, y>0$\nQuadrant III: All points $(x, y)$ with $x<0, y<0$\nQuadrant IV: All points $(x, y)$ with $x>0, y<0$\nThe point $P$ in the plane that corresponds to an ordered pair $(x, y)$ is called the graph of $(x, y)$.\nThus given a set of ordered pairs of real numbers, the graph of the set is the aggregate of all points in the plane that correspond to ordered pairs of the set.\n\n## i- Write down the coordinates of the points if not mentioned.\nii- Locate $(0,-1),(2,2),(-4,7)$ and $(-3,-3)$.\n\n#### 4.1.1 The Distance Formula\n\nLet *A* (*x*<sub>1</sub>, *y*<sub>1</sub>) and *B* (*x*<sub>2</sub>, *y*<sub>2</sub>) be two points in the plane. We can find the distance *d* = |*AB*| from the right triangle *AQB* by using the Pythagorean theorem. We have\n\n$$\nd = AB = AQ + QB^2 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\n|*AQ*| = |*BS*| = |*BO* + *OS*|\n\n|*OR* | *OS*|\n\n|*SB*| = |*SB* - *SQ*|\n\n|*y*<sub>1</sub> | *y*<sub>1</sub> | | || || | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\nor\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{k_1 v_1 + k_2 v_2}{k_1 + k_2}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, by drawing perpendiculars from *A*, *B* and *P* to the *y*-axis and proceeding as before, we can show that\n\n$$\ny = \\frac{k_1 v_1 + k_2 v_2}{k_1 + k_2}\n$$\n\n#### **Note:**\n\n(i) If the directed distances *AP* and *PB* have the same sign, then their ratio is positive and *P* is said to divide *AB* internally.\n\n(ii) If the directed distances *AP* and *PB* have opposite signs i.e., *P* is beyond *AB*, then their ratio is negative and *P* is said to divide *AB* **externally**.\n\n$$\n\\frac{AP}{BP} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{AP}{PB} = \\frac{k_2}{k_2}\n$$\n\nProceeding as before, we can show in this case that\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{k_1 v_1 - k_2 v_2}{k_1 - k_2} \\quad \\text{y} \\quad \\frac{k_1 v_2 - k_2 v_2}{k_1 - k_2}\n$$\n\nThus *P* is said to divide the line segment *AB* in ratio *k₁*, *k₂*, **internally** or **externally** according as *P* lies between *AB* or beyond *AB*.\n\n(iii) If *k₁ = k₂ = 1:1*, then *P* becomes **midpoint** of *AB* and coordinates of *P* are\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\quad \\text{y} \\quad \\frac{y_1 - y_2}{2}\n$$\n\n(iv) The above theorem is valid in whichever quadrant *A* and *B* lie.\n\n**Example 1:** Find the coordinates of the point that divides the join of *A* (−6, 3) and *B* (5, −2) in the ratio 2 : 3.\n\n(i) internally\n\n(ii) externally\n\n**Solution:** (i) Here *k₁ = 2, k₂ = 3, x₁ = 6, x₂ = 5*.\n\nBy the formula, we have\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{2 \\times 5 + 3 \\times (-6)}{2 + 3} \\quad \\frac{-8}{5} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y \\quad \\frac{2(-2) + 3(3)}{2 + 3} \\quad 1\n$$\n\nCoordinates of the required point are (−8, 5, 1)\n\n(ii) In this case\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{2 \\times 5 - 3 \\times (-6)}{2 - 3} \\quad \\frac{28}{5} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = \\frac{2(-2) - 3(3)}{2 + 3} \\quad 13\n$$\n\nThus the required point has coordinates (−28, 13)\n\n#### **Theorem:**\n\nThe centroid of a *ΔABC* is a point that divides each median in the ratio 2 : 1. Using this show that medians of a triangle are concurrent.\n\n**Proof:** Let the vertices of a *ΔABC* have coordinates as shown in the figure.\n\nMidpoint of *BC* is *D* (x, y, z, x₀, y₁, z, z₀).\n\nLet *G* (x, y) be the centroid of the *Δ*. Then *G* divides *AD* in the ratio 2 : 1. Therefore\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} + 1 \\cdot x_1}{2 + 1} \\quad \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, y = x, y, z, x₀.\n\nIn the same way, we can show that coordinate of the point that divides *BE* and *CF* each in the ratio 2 : 1 are (x, y, z, x₀, y₁, z, z₀).\n\nThus (x, y) lies on each median and so the medians of the *ΔABC* are concurrent.\n\n**Theorem:** Bisectors of angles of a triangle are concurrent.\n\n**Proof:** Let the coordinates of the vertices of a triangle be as shown in the figure.\n\nSuppose |*BC*| = *a*, |*CA*| = *b* and |*AB*| = *c*.\n\nLet the bisector of *LA* meet *BC* at *D*. Then *D* divides *BC* in the ratio *c* : *b*. Therefore\n\ncoordinates of $D$ are $\\left(\\frac{c x_{1}+b x_{2}}{b+c} \\cdot \\frac{c y_{1}+b y_{2}}{b+c}\\right)$\nThe bisector of $\\angle B$ meets $A C$ at $I$ and $I$ divides $A D$ in the ratio $c:|B D|$\nNow $\\frac{|B D|}{|D C|}=\\frac{c}{b}$ or $\\frac{|D C|}{|B D|} \\cdot \\frac{b}{c}$\nor $\\frac{|D C|+|B D|}{|B D|}=\\frac{b+c}{c}$\nor $\\frac{a}{|B D|}=\\frac{b+c}{c}$ or $|B D| \\cdot \\frac{a c}{b+c}$\nThus $I$ divides $A D$ in the ratio $c: \\frac{a c}{b+c}$ or in the ratio $b+c: a$ Coordinates of $I$ are\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{(b+c) \\frac{b x_{2}+c x_{1}}{b+c}+a x_{1}}{a+b+c} \\cdot \\frac{(b+c) \\frac{b y_{2}+c y_{1}}{b+c}+a y_{1}}{a+b+c}\\right)\n$$\n\ni.e., $\\quad\\left(\\frac{a x_{1}+b x_{2}+c x_{1}}{a+b+c} \\cdot \\frac{a y_{1}+b y_{2}+c y_{2}}{a+b+c}\\right)$\n\nThe symmetry of these coordinates shows that the bisector of $\\angle C$ will also pass through this point.\n\nThus the angle bisectors of a triangle are concurrent.\n\n## EXERCISE 4.1\n\n1.

Through $O^{\\prime}$ draw two mutually perpendicular lines $O X, O Y$ such that $O X$ is parallel to $O x$. The new axes $O X$ and $O Y$ are called translations of the $O x$-and $O y$ - axes through the point $O^{\\prime}$. In translation of axes, origin is shifted to another point in the plane but the axes remain parallel to the old axes.\n\nLet $P$ be a point with coordinates $(x, y)$ referred to $x y$-coordinate system and the axes be translated through the point $O^{\\prime}(h, k)$ and $O X, O Y$ be the new axes. If $P$ has coordinates $(X, Y)$ referred to the new axes, then we need to find $X, Y$ in terms of $x, y$.\n\nDraw $P M$ and $O^{\\prime} N$ perpendiculars to $O x$.\nFrom the figure, we have\n$O M=x, M P=y, O N=h, N O^{\\prime}=k=M M^{\\prime}$\nNow $\\quad X=O^{\\prime} M^{\\prime}=N M=O M-O M-O N=x-h$\nSimilarly, $\\quad Y=M^{\\prime} P=M P-M M^{\\prime}=y \\quad k$\nThus the coordinates of $P$ referred to $X Y$-system are $(x-h, y-k)$\ni.e. $\\quad X=x-h$\n$Y=y-k$\nMoreover, $x=X+h,+y=Y \\quad k$.\nExample 1: The coordinates of a point $P$ are $(-6,9)$. The axes are translated through the point $O^{\\prime}(-3,2)$. Find the coordinates of $P$ referred to the new axes.\n\nSolution. Here $h=3 k k 2$\nCoordinates of $P$ referred to the new axes are $(X, Y)$ given by\n\n$$\nX=-6-(-3)=-3 \\text { and } Y=9-2=7\n$$\n\nThus $P(X, Y)=P(-3,7)$.\nExample 2: The $x y$-coordinate axes are translated through the point $O^{\\prime}(4,6)$. The coordinates of the point $P$ are $(2,-3)$ referred to the new axes. Find the coordinates of $P$ referred to the original axes.\n\nSolution: Here $X=2, Y=3, h=4, k \\quad 6$.\nWe have $\\quad x=X+h=4+2=6$\n$y=Y+k=-3+6=3$\nThus required coordinates are $P(6,3)$.\n\n## Rotation of Axes\n\nLet $x y$-coordinate system be given. We rotate $O x$ and $O y$ about the origin through an angle $\\theta\\left(0<\\theta<90^{\\circ}\\right)$ so that the new axes are $O X$ and $O Y$ as shown in the figure. Let a point $P$ have coordinates $(x, y)$ referred to the $x y$-system of\ncoordinates. Suppose $P$ has coordinates $(X, Y)$ referred to the $X Y$-coordinate system. We have to find $X, Y$ in terms of the given coordinates $x, y$. Let $\\alpha$ be measure of the angle that $O P$ makes with $O$.\n\nFrom $P$, draw $P M$ perpendicular to $O x$ and $P M^{\\prime}$ perpendicular to $O X$. Let $|O P|=r$. From the right triangle $O P M^{\\prime}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\left.\\begin{array}{l}\nO M^{\\prime}=X=r \\cos (\\alpha-\\theta) \\\\\nM^{\\prime} P=Y=r \\sin (\\alpha-\\theta)\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nAlso from the $\\triangle O P M$, we have\n\n$$\nx=r \\cos \\alpha, \\quad y=r \\sin \\alpha\n$$\n\nSystem of equations (1) may be re-written as:\n\n$$\n\\left.\\begin{array}{l}\nX=r \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\theta \\quad r \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\theta \\\\\nY=r \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\theta \\quad r \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\theta\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nSubstituting from (2) into the above equations, we have\n\n$$\n\\left.\\begin{array}{l}\nX=x \\cos \\theta+y \\sin \\theta \\\\\nY=y \\cos \\theta-x \\sin \\theta\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n$$\n\ni.e., $(X, Y)=(x \\cos \\theta \\quad y \\sin \\theta, \\min \\theta \\quad y \\cos \\theta)$\nare the coordinates of $P$ referred to the new axes $O X$ and $O Y$.\nExample 3: The $x y$-coordinate axes are rotated about the origin through an angle of $30^{\\circ}$. If the $x y$-coordinates of a point are $(5,7)$, find its $X Y$-coordinates, where $O X$ and $O Y$ are the axes obtained after rotation.\n\nSolution. Let $(X, Y)$ be the coordinates of $P$ referred to the $X Y$-axes. Here $\\theta=30^{\\circ}$.\nFrom equations (3) above, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& X=5 \\cos 30^{\\circ}+7 \\sin 30^{\\circ} \\text { and } \\quad \\forall=5 \\sin 30^{\\circ} 7 \\cos 30^{\\circ} \\\\\n\\text { or } & X=\\frac{5 \\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{7}{2}=\\text { and } \\quad Y=\\frac{-5}{2}, \\frac{7 \\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\ni.e., $(X, Y) \\quad\\left(\\frac{5 \\sqrt{3}+7}{2}, \\frac{-5+7 \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$\nare the required coordinates.\n\nExample 4: $\\quad$ The $x y$-axes are rotated about the origin through an angle of arctan $\\frac{4}{3}$ lying in the first quadrant. The coordinates of a point $P$ referred to the new axes $O X$ and $O Y$ are $P(-1,-7)$. Find the coordinates of $P$ referred to the $x y$-coordinate system.\n\nSolution. Let $P(x, y)$ be the coordinates of $P$ referred to the $x y$-coordinate system. Angle of rotation is given by arctan $\\theta=\\frac{4}{3}$. Therefore, $\\sin \\theta=\\frac{4}{5}, \\cos \\theta=\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nFrom equations (3) above, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& X=x \\cos \\theta+y \\sin \\theta \\text { and } \\quad \\forall=x \\sin \\theta \\quad y \\cos \\theta \\\\\n\\text { or } & -1=\\frac{3}{5} x+\\frac{4}{5} y \\text { and }-7=-\\frac{4}{5} x+\\frac{3}{5} y \\\\\n\\text { or } & 3 x+4 y+5=0 \\text { and }-4 x+3 y+35=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolving these equations, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{x}{125}=-\\frac{y}{-125}=\\frac{1}{25} \\quad \\Rightarrow x=5, y=-5\n$$\n\nThus coordinates of $P$ referred to the $x y$-system are $(5,-5)$.\n\n## EXERCISE 4.2\n\n1.

The measure of steepness (ratio of rise to the run) is termed as slope or gradient of the inclined path and is denoted by $m$.\n$$\nm=\\frac{r i s e}{r u n}=\\frac{y}{x}=\\tan \\alpha\n$$\n\nIn analytical geometry, slope or gradient $\\boldsymbol{m}$ of a non-vertical straight line with $\\alpha$ as its inclination is defined by: $m: \\tan \\alpha$\n\nIf $l$ is horizontal its slope is zero and if $l$ is vertical then its slope is undefined.\nIf $0<\\alpha<90^{\\circ}, \\mathrm{m}$ is positive and if $90^{\\circ}<\\alpha<180^{\\circ}$, then $m$ is negative\n\n### 4.3.1 Slope or Gradient of a Straight Line Joining Two Points\n\nIf a non-vertical line $l$ with inclination $\\alpha$ passes through two points $P\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ and $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ , then the slope or gradient $m$ of $l$ is given by $m=\\frac{y_{1}-y_{1}}{x_{1}-x_{1}}=\\tan \\alpha$\nProof: Let m be the slope of the line $l$.\nDraw perpendiculars $P M$ and $Q M^{\\prime}$ on $x$-axis and a perpendicular $P R$ on $Q M^{\\prime}$\nThen $\\angle R P Q=\\alpha, m \\overline{P R}=x_{1}-x_{1}$ and $m \\overline{Q R}=y_{1}-y_{1}$\nThe slope or gradient of $l$ is defined as: $m=\\tan \\alpha=\\frac{y_{1}-y_{1}}{x_{1}-x_{1}}$\n\n**Case (i).** When 0 < α < π/2\n\nIn the right triangle *PRQ*, we have\n\n$$\nm = \\tan \\alpha = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\n\n**Case (ii)** When π/2 < α < π\n\nIn the right triangle *PRQ*\n\n$$\n\\tan (\\pi - \\alpha) = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n-\\tan \\alpha = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\tan \\alpha = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\n\nThus if *P(x1, y1)* and *Q(x2, y2)* are two points on a line, then slope of *PQ* is given by:\n\n$$\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad m \\quad \\frac{y_2 - y_2}{x_2 - x_2}\n$$\n\n**Note:**\n\n- (i) $m \\neq \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ and $m \\neq \\frac{y_2 - y_2}{x_2 - x_1}$.\n- (ii) $f$ is horizontal, iff $m = 0$ (∀ α = 0).\n- (iii) $f$ is vertical, iff $m$ is not defined (∀ α = 90).\n- (iv) If slope of *AB* = slope of *BC*, then the points *A*, *B* and *C* are collinear.\n\n**Theorem:** The two lines *l1* and *l2* with respective slopes *m1* and *m2* are\n\n- (i) parallel iff *m1 = m2*.\n- (ii) perpendicular iff *m1 =* 1/*m2*\n\nor\n\n$$\nm_1 m_2 + l = 0\n$$\n\n**Example 1:** Show that the points *A*(–3, 6), *B*(3, 2) and *C*(6, 0) are collinear.\n\n**Solution:** We know that the points *A*, *B* and *C* are collinear if the line *AB* and *BC* have the same slopes. Here Slope of\n\n$$\nAB = \\frac{2 - 6}{3 - (-3)} = \\frac{-4}{3 + 3} = \\frac{-4}{6} = \\frac{-2}{3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{0 - 2}{6 - 3} = \\frac{-2}{3}\n$$\n\nSlope of *AB* = Slope of *BC*\n\nThus *A*, *B* and *C* are collinear.\n\n**Example 2:** Show that the triangle with vertices *A*(1, 1), *B*(4, 5) and *C*(12, –1) is a right triangle.\n\n**Solution:** Slope of *AB* = *m1* = 5/1 + 4/3\n\n$$\n\\text{and Slope of } BC = m_2 = \\frac{-1 - 5}{12 - 4} = \\frac{-6}{8} = \\frac{-3}{4}\n$$\n\nSince *m1m2* = (4/3) - 3/4 = 1, therefore, *AB* ⊥ *BC*\n\nSo Δ*ABC* is a right triangle.\n\n**4.

the points on the line *I* parallel to *x*-axis remain at a constant distance (say *a*) from *x*-axis. Therefore, each point on the line has its distance from *x*-axis equal to *a*, which is its *y*-coordinate (ordinate). So, all the points on this line satisfy the equation: *y* = *a*\n\n|  Note: | (i) | If *a* > 0, then the line *I* is above the *x*-axis.  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | (ii) | If *a* < 0, then the line *I* is below the *x*-axis.  |\n|   | (iii) | If *a* = 0, then the line *I* becomes the *x*-axis.  |\n|   |  | Thus the equation of *x*-axis is *y* = 0  |\n\n### 4.3.2 Equation of a Straight Line Parallel to the *x*-axis (or perpendicular to the *y*-axis)\n\n### 4.3.4 Derivation of Standard Forms of Equations of Straight Lines\n\n#### Intercepts:\n\n- If a line intersects *x*-axis at (*a*, 0), then *a* is called *x*-intercept of the line.\n- If a line intersects *y*-axis at (0, *b*), then *b* is called *y*-intercept of the line.\n\n#### 1. Slope-Intercept form of Equation of a Straight Line:\n\n**Theorem:** Equation of a non-vertical straight line with slope *m* and *y*-intercept *c* is given by:\n\n$$ y = mx + c $$\n\n**Proof:** Let *P*(*x*, *y*) be an arbitrary point of the straight line *I* with slope *m* and *y*-intercept *c*.

Draw a perpendicular from $P$ on $x$-axis meeting the line at $\\left\\langle x_{i} x_{i}, y^{\\prime}\\right\\rangle$.\n\nThus $a x_{i}+b y^{\\prime}+c=0$ so that\n\n$$\ny^{\\prime}=\\frac{a}{b} x_{i} \\quad \\frac{c}{b}\n$$\n\nThe point $P\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ is above the line if $y_{i}>y^{\\prime}$ that is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y_{i}-y^{\\prime}>0 \\\\\n\\text { i.e. } & y_{i}-\\left(-\\frac{a}{b} x_{i}-\\frac{c}{b}\\right)>0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad & a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c>0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly $P\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ is below the line if\n\n$$\ny_{i}-y^{\\prime}<0 \\quad \\text { i.e. } y_{i}-\\left(-\\frac{a}{b} x_{i}-\\frac{c}{b}\\right)\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\na x_{i}+b y_{i}+c<0\n$$\n\nThe point $P\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ is on the line if\n\n$$\na x_{i}+b y_{i}+c=\n$$\n\nCorollary 1. The point $P$ is above or below $I$ respectively if $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c$ and $b$ have the same sign or have opposite signs.\n\nProof. If $P$ is above $I$, then $y_{i}-y^{\\prime}>0$ i.e., $\\frac{a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c}{b}>0$\nThus $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c$ and $b$ have the same sign.\nSimilarly, $P$ is below $I$ if\n\n$$\ny_{i}-y^{\\prime}<0 \\quad \\text { i.e., } \\frac{a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c}{b}<0\n$$\n\nThus $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c$ and $b$ have opposite signs.\nCorollary 2.

(i) The point $P\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ and $O(0,0)$ are on the same side of $I$ if $a x_{i}+b y_{i}+c$ and $a .0+b .0+c$ have the same sign.\n(ii) Proof is left as an exercise\n\nExample 1: Check whether the point $(-2,4)$ lies above or below the line $4 x+5 y-3=0$\n\nSolution: Here $b=5$ is positive. Also\n$4(-2)+5(4)-3=-8+20-3=9>0$\nThe coefficient of $y$ in (1) and the expression (2) have the same sign and so the point $(-2,4)$ lies above (1).\n\nExample 2: $\\quad$ Check whether the origin and the point $P(5,-8)$ lie on the same side or on the opposite sides of the line:\n\n$$\n3 x+7 y+15=0\n$$\n\n## Solution:\n\nHere $\\quad c=15$\nFor $P(5,-8)$,\n$3(5)+7(-8)+15=-26<0$\nBut $\\quad c=15>0$\n$c$ and the expression (2) have opposite signs.

For different values of $h$, (3) represents different lines. Thus (3) is a family of lines.\n\nIf $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ is any point lying on both (1) and (2), then it is their point of intersection. Since $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ lies on both (1) and (2), we have\n\n$$\na_{1} x+b_{1} y+c_{1}=0+\\text { and }+a_{2} x \\quad b_{2} y \\quad c_{2} \\quad 0\n$$\n\nFrom the above two equations, we note that $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ also lies on (3).\nThus (3) is the required family of lines through the point of intersection of (1) and (2). Since $h$ can assume an infinite number of values, (3) represents an infinite number of lines.\n\nA particular line of the family (3) can be determined if one more condition is given.\nExample 2: Find the family of lines through the point of intersection of the lines\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 3 x-4 y-10=0 \\\\\n& x+2 y-10=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFind the member of the family which is\n(i) parallel to a line with slope $\\frac{-2}{3}$\n(ii) perpendicular to the line $l: 3 x-4 y+1=0$.\n\nSolution: (i) A family of lines through the point of intersection of equations (1) and (2) is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 3 x-4 y-10+k(x+2 y-10)=0 \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad(3+k) x+(-4+2 k) y+(-10-10 k)=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSlope $m$ of (3) is given by: $m=-\\frac{3+k}{-4+2 k}$\nThis is slope of any member of the family (3).\nIf (3) is parallel to the line with slope $-\\frac{2}{3}$ then\n$-\\frac{3+k}{-4+2 k}=\\frac{-2}{3}$ or $9+3 k=-8+4 k$ i.e., $k=17$\nSubstituting $k=17$ into (3), equation of the member of the family is\n$20 x+30 y-180=0$ i.e., $2 x+3 y-18=0$\n(ii) Slope of $3 x-4 y+1=0$\nis $\\frac{3}{4}$.

Conversely, the graph of any linear equation in $x$ and $y$ is a straight line.\n\nSuppose we have two straight lines represented by\n\n$$\na_{x} x+b_{y} y+c_{z}=0\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\na_{y} x+b_{z} y+c_{x}=0\n$$\n\nMultiplying equations (1) and (2), we have\n\n$$\n\\left(a_{x} x+b_{y} y+c_{z}\\right)\\left(a_{y} x+b_{z} y+c_{x}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nIt is a second degree equation in $x$ and $y$.\nEquation (3) is called joint equation of the pair of lines (1) and (2). On the other hand, given an equation of the second degree in $x$ and $y$, say\n\n$$\na x^{2}+2 h x y+b y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0\n$$\n\nwhere $a \\neq 0$, represents equations of a pair of lines if (4) can be resolved into two linear factors. In this section, we shall study special joint equations of pairs of lines which pass through the origin.\n\nLet $y=m_{1} x$ and $y=m_{2} x$ be two lines passing through the origin. Their joint equation is: $\\left(y-m_{1} x\\right)\\left(y-m_{2} x\\right)=0$\nor $\\quad y^{2}-\\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\\right) x y+m_{1} m_{2} x^{2}=0$\nEquation (5) is a special type of a second degree homogeneous equation.\n\n### 4.6.1 Homogeneous Equation\n\nLet $f(x, y)=0$\nbe any equation in the variables $x$ and $y$. Equation (1) is called a homogeneous equation of degree $n$ (a positive integer) if\n\n$$\nf(k x, k y)=k^{n} f(x, y)\n$$\n\nfor some real number $k$.\nFor example, in equation (5) above if we replace $x$ and $y$ by $k x$ and $k y$ respectively, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& k^{2} y^{2}-k^{2}\\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\\right) x y+k^{2} m_{1} m_{2} x^{2}=0 \\\\\n\\text { or } & k^{2}\\left[y^{2}-\\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\\right) x y+m_{1} m_{2} x^{2}\\right]=0 \\quad \\text { i.e., } \\quad k^{2} f(x, y) \\quad 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus (5) is a homogeneous equation of degree 2.\n\n$$\na x^{2}+2 h x y+b y^{2}=0\n$$\n\nA general second degree homogeneous equation can be written as:\n\n$$\na x^{2}+2 h x y+b y^{2}=0\n$$\n\nprovided $a, h$ and $b$ are not simultaneously zero.\n\nTheorem: Every homogenous second degree equation\n\n$$\na x^{2}+2 h x y+b y^{2}=0\n$$\n\nrepresents a pair of lines through the origin. The lines are\n(i) real and distinct, if $h^{2}>a b$\n(ii) real and coincident, if $h \\quad a b$\n(iii) imaginary, if $h^{2}<a b$\n\nProof: Multiplying (1) by b and re-arranging the terms, we have\n\n$$\nb^{2} y^{2}+2 b k x y+a b x^{2}=0\n$$\n\nor $\\quad b^{2} y^{2}+2 b k x y+h^{3} x^{2}-h^{3} x^{2}+a b x^{2}=0$\nor $\\quad(b y+h x)^{3}-x^{2}\\left(h^{3}-a b\\right)=0$\nor $\\quad(b y+h x+x \\sqrt{h^{3}-a b})(b y+h x-x \\sqrt{h^{3}-a b})=0$\nThus (1) represents a pair of lines whose equations are:\n\n$$\nb y+x\\left(h+\\sqrt{h^{3}-a b}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nand $b y+x\\left(h-\\sqrt{h^{3}-a b}\\right)=0$\nClearly, the lines (2) and (3) are\n(i) real and distinct if $h^{3}>a b$. (ii) real and coincident, if $h^{3}=a b$.\n(iii) imaginary, if $h^{3}<a b$.\n\nIt is interesting to note that even in case the lines are imaginary, they intersect in a real point viz $(0,0)$ since this point lies on their joint equation (1).\n\nExample: Find an equation of each of the lines represented by\n\n$$\n20 x^{2}+17 x y-24 y^{2}=0\n$$\n\nSolution. The equation may be written as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 24\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)^{2}-17\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)-20=0 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{y}{x}=\\frac{17 \\pm \\sqrt{289+1920}}{48}-\\frac{17 \\pm 47}{48}-\\frac{4}{3}-\\frac{-5}{8} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad y=\\frac{4}{3} x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad y=\\frac{-5}{8} x \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad 4 x-3 y=0 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 5 x+8 y=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nversion: 1.1\n\n### 4.6.2 To find measure of the angle between the lines represented by\n\n$$\na x^{2}+2 h x y+b y^{2}=0\n$$\n\nWe have already seen that the lines represented by (1) are\n\n$$\nb y+x\\left(h+\\sqrt{h^{3}-a b}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nand $\\quad b y+x\\left(h-\\sqrt{h^{3}-a b}\\right)=0$\nNow slopes of (2) and (3) are respectively given by:\n\n$$\nm_{1}=\\frac{-\\left(h+\\sqrt{h^{3}-a b}\\right)}{b}, \\text { and } m_{2}=\\frac{-\\left(h-\\sqrt{h^{3}-a b}\\right)}{b}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $m_{1}+m_{2}=\\frac{-2 h}{b} \\quad$ and $m_{1} m_{2} \\quad \\frac{a}{b}$\nIf $\\theta$ is measure of the angle between the lines (2) and (3), then\n\n$$\n\\tan \\theta=\\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\\right)^{2}-4 m_{1} m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{4 h^{3}-4 a}{b^{3}}-\\frac{a}{b}}}{1+\\frac{a}{b}} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\sqrt{h^{3}-a b}}{a+b}\n$$\n\nThe two lines are parallel, if $\\theta=0$, so that $\\tan \\theta=0$ which implies $\\boldsymbol{h}^{3}-\\boldsymbol{a} \\boldsymbol{b}=\\mathbf{0}$, which is the condition for the lines to be coincident.\nIf the lines are orthogonal, then $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$, so that $\\tan \\theta$ is not defined. This implies $\\boldsymbol{a}+\\boldsymbol{b}=\\mathbf{0}$. Hence the condition for (1) to represent a pair of orthogonal (perpendicular) lines is that sum of the coefficients of $\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{y}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ is $\\mathbf{0}$.\n\nExample 1: Find measure of the angle between the lines represented by\n\n$$\nx^{2}-x y-6 y^{2}=0\n$$\n\nSolution.

          "title": "Linear Inequalities and Linear Programming\n\n## 5.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nMany real life problems involve linear inequalities. Here we shall consider those problems (relating to trade, industry and agriculture etc.) which involve systems of linear inequalities in two variables. Linear inequalities in such problems are used to prescribe limitations or restrictions on allocation of available resources (material, capital, machine capacities, labour hours, land etc.). In this chapter, our main goal will be to optimize (maximize or minimize) a quantity under consideration subject to certain restrictions.\n\nThe method under our discussion is called the linear programming method and it involves solutions of certain linear inequalities.\n\n### 5.2 LINEAR INEQUALITIES\n\nInequalities are expressed by the following four symbols;\n$>$ (greater than); < (less than); $\\geq$ (greater than or equal to); $\\leq$ (less than or equal to)\nFor example (i) $a x<b$ (ii) $a x+b \\geq c$ (iii) $a x+b y>c$ (iv) $a x+b y \\leq c$ are inequalities. Inequalities (i) and (ii) are in one variable while inequalities (iii) and (iv) are in two variables.\n\nThe following operations will not affect the order (or sense) of inequality while changing it to simpler equivalent form:\n(i) Adding or subtracting a constant to each side of it.\n(ii) Multiplying or dividing each side of it by a positive constant.\n\nNote that the order (or sense) of an inequality is changed by multiplying or dividing its each side by a negative constant.\n\nNow for revision we consider inequality, $x<\\frac{3}{2}$\nAll real numbers $<\\frac{3}{2}$ are in the solution set of (A).\nThus the interval $\\left(-\\infty, \\frac{3}{2}\\right)$ or $-\\infty<x<\\frac{3}{2}$ is the solution set of the\ninequality (A) which is shown in the figure 5.21\n\n$$\n-5 \\quad-4 \\quad-3 \\quad-2 \\quad-1 \\quad 0 \\quad 1 \\quad 2 \\quad 3 \\quad 4 \\quad 5\n$$\n\nWe conclude that the solution set of an inequality consists of all solutions of the inequality.\n\n### 5.2.1 Graphing of A Linear Inequality in Two Variables\n\nGenerally a linear inequality in two variables $x$ and $y$ can be one of the following forms: $a x+b y<c ; \\quad a x+b y>c ; \\quad a x+b y \\leq c ; \\quad a x+b y \\geq c$\nwhere $a, b, c$ are constants and $a, b$ are not both zero.\nWe know that the graph of linear equation of the form\n$a x+b y=c$ is a line which divides the plane into two disjoint regions as stated below:\n(1) The set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ such that $a x+b y<c$\n(2) The set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ such that $a x+b y>c$\n\nThe regions (1) and (2) are called half planes and the line $a x+b y=c$ is called the boundary of each half plane.\n\nNote that a vertical line divides the plane into left and right half planes while a nonvertical line divides the plane into upper and lower half planes.\n\nA solution of a linear inequality in $x$ and $y$ is an ordered pair of numbers which satisfies the inequality.\n\nFor example, the ordered pair $(1,1)$ is a solution of the inequality $x+2 y<6$ because $1+2(1)=3<6$ which is true.\n\nThere are infinitely many ordered pairs that satisfy the inequality $x+2 y<6$, so its graph will be a half plane.\n\nNote that the linear equation $a x+b y=c$ is called \"associated or corresponding equation\" of each of the above mentioned inequalities.\n\n## Procedure for Graphing a linear Inequality in two Variables\n\n(i) The corresponding equation of the inequality is first graphed by using 'dashes' if the inequality involves the symbols $>$ or $<$ and a solid line is drawn if the inequality involves the symbols $\\geq$ or $\\leq$.\n(ii) A test point (not on the graph of the corresponding equation) is chosen which determines that the half plane is on which side of the boundary line.\n\nExample 1. Graph the inequality *x* + 2*y* < 6.\n\nSolution. The associated equation of the inequality\n\n$$x + 2y < 6 \\quad \\text{(i)}$$\n\nis\n\n$$x + 2y = 6 \\quad \\text{(ii)}$$\n\nThe line (ii) intersects the *x*-axis and *y*-axis at (6, 0) and (0, 3) respectively. As no point of the line (ii) is a solution *x* of the inequality (i), so the graph of the line (ii) is shown by using dashes. We take *O*(0, 0) as a test point because it is not on the line (ii).\n\nSubstituting *x* = 0, *y* = 0 in the expression *x* + 2*y* gives 0 – 2(0) = 0 < 6, so the point (0, 0) satisfies the inequality (i).\n\nAny other point below the line (ii) satisfies the inequality (i), that is all points in the half plane containing the point (0, 0) satisfy the inequality (i).\n\nThus the graph of the solution set of inequality (i) is the a region on the origin-side of the line (ii), that is, the region below the line (ii). A portion of the open halfplane below the line (ii) is shown as shaded region in figure 5.22(a).\n\nAll points above the dashed line satisfy the inequality *x* + 2*y* > 6 (iii).\n\nA portion of the open half plane above the line (ii) is shown by shading in figure 5.22(b).\n\nNote: 1. The graph of the inequality *x* + 2*y* ≤ 6 ..(iv) includes the graph of the line (ii), so the open half-plane below the line (ii) including the graph of the line (ii) is the graph of the inequality (iv). A portion of the graph of the inequality (iv) is shown by shading in figure 5.22(c).\n\nNote: 2. All points on the line (ii) and above the line (ii) satisfy the inequality *x* + 2*y* ≥ 6 .... (v). This means that the solution set of the inequality (v) consists of all points above the line (ii) and all points on the lines (ii). The graph of the inequality (v) is partially shown as shaded region in figure 5.22(d).\n\nNote: 3. that the graphs of *x* + 2*y* ≤ 6 and *x* + 2*y* ≥ 6 are closed half planes.\n\nExample 2. Graph the following linear inequalities in *xy*-plane;\n\n(i) 2*x* ≥ –3 (ii) *y* ≤ 2\n\nSolution. The inequality (i) in *xy*-plane is considered as 2*x* + 0*y* ≥ –3 and its solution set consists of all points (*x*, *y*) such that *x*, *y* ∈ *R* and *x* ≥ –3/2.\n\nThe corresponding equation of the inequality (i) is 2*x* = –3 (1) which a vertical line (parallel to the *y*-axis) and its graph is drawn in figure 5.23(a).\n\nThe graph of the inequality 2*x* > –3 is the open half plane to the right of the line (1).\n\nThus the graph of 2*x* ≥ –3 is the closed half-plane to the right of the line (1).\n\n(ii) The associated equation of the inequality (ii) is *y* = 2 (2) which is a horizontal line (parallel to the *x*-axis) and its graph is shown in figure 5.23(b). Here the solution set of the inequality *y* < 2 is the open half plane below the boundary line *y* = 2. Thus the graph of *y* ≤ 2 consists of the boundary line and the open half plane below it.\n\nNote that the intersection of graphs of 2x ≥ –3 and y ≤ 2 is partially shown in the adjoining figure 5.23(c).\n\n### 5.3 REGION BOUNDED BY 2 OR 3 SIMULTANEOUS INEQUALITIES\n\nThe graph of a system of inequalities consists of the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) in the xy-plane which simultaneously satisfy all the inequalities in the system. Find the graph of such a system, we draw the graph of each inequality in the system on the same coordinate axes and then take intersection of all the graphs. The common region so obtained is called the solution region for the system of inequalities.\n\n#### Example 1: Graph the system of inequalities\n\n$$\nx - 2y \\leq 6\n$$\n\n$$\n2x + y \\geq 2\n$$\n\n#### Solution.\n\nThe graph of the line x – 2y = 6 is drawn by joining the point (6, 0) and (0, –3). The point (0, 0) satisfies the inequality x – 2y < 6 because 0 – 2(0) = 0 < 6. Thus the graph of x – 2y ≤ 6 is the upper half-plane including the graph of the line x – 2y = 6. The closed half-plane is partially shown by shading in figure 5.31(a).\n\n#### Solution.\n\nThe graph of the line x – 2y = 6 is drawn by joining the point (6, 0) and (0, –3). The point (0, 0) satisfies the inequality x – 2y < 6 because 0 – 2(0) = 0 < 6. Thus the graph of x – 2y ≤ 6 is the upper half-plane including the graph of the line x – 2y = 6. The closed half-plane is partially shown by shading in figure 5.31(a).\n\n#### *version: 1.1*\n\nWe draw the graph of the line 2x + y = 2 joining the points (1, 0) and (0, 2). The point (0, 0) does not satisfy the inequality 2x + y > 2 because 2(0) + 0 = 0 ≠ 2. Thus the graph of the inequality 2x + y ≥ 2 is the closed half-plane not on the origin-side of the line 2x + y = 2.\n\nThus the closed half-plane is shown partially as a shaded region in figure 5.31(b). The solution region of the given system of inequalities is the intersection of the graphs indicated in figures 5.31(a) and 5.31(b) and is shown as shaded region in figure 5.31(c).\n\nThe intersection point (2, – 2) can be found by solving the equations x – 2y = 6 and 2x + y = 2.\n\nNote that the line x – 2y = 6 and 2x + y = 2 divide the xy-plane into four regions bounded by these lines. These four (bounded) regions are displayed in the adjoining figure.\n\nExample 2. Graph the solution region for the following system of inequalities:\n\n$$x - 2y \\leq 6, \\quad 2x + y > 2, \\quad x + 2y \\geq 10$$\n\nSolution: The graph of the inequalities $x-2 y \\leq 6$ and $2 x+y \\geq 2$ have already drawn in figure 5.31(a) and 5.31(b) and their intersection is partially shown as a shaded region in figure 5.31(c) of the example 1 Art (5.3). Following the procedure of the example 1 of Art (5.3) the graph of the inequality $x+2 y \\leq 10$ is shown partially in the figure 5.32(a).\n\nThe intersection of three graphs is the required solution region which is the shaded triangular region $P Q R$ (including its sides) shown partially in the figure 5.32(b).\n\nNow we define a corner point of a solution region.\n\n## DEFINITION:\n\nA point of a solution region where two of its boundary lines intersect, is called a corner point or vertex of the solution region.\n\nSuch points play a useful role while solving linear programming problems. In example 2, the following three corner points are obtained by corresponding equations (of linear inequalities) given in the example 2(a) pairs.\n\n|  Corresponding lines of inequalities: | Corner Points  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  $x-2 y=6, \\quad 2 x+y=2$ | $P(2,-2)$  |\n|  $x-2 y=6, \\quad x+2 y=10$ | $Q(8,1)$  |\n|  $2 x+y=2, \\quad x+2 y=10$ | $R(-2,6)$  |\n\nExample 3.

The common region of the graphs of inequalities is partially shown as a shaded region in $x^{2}$ figure 5.33(a).\n\nThe graph of $y \\geq 0$ is the upper half plane including the graph of the corresponding line $y=0$ (the $x$-axis) of the linear inequality $y \\geq 0$. The graph of $y \\geq 0$ is partially displayed in figure 5.33(b).\n\nThe solution region of the system of inequalities in (i) is the intersection of the graphs shown in figure 5.33(a) and 5.33(b). This solution region is displayed in figure 5.33(c).\n\n(ii) See figure 5.33(a) for the graphs of the inequalities 2*x* + *y* ≥ 2 and *x* + 2*y* ≤ 10.\n\nThe graph of *x* ≥ 0 consists of the open half-plane to the right of the corresponding line *x* = 0 (*y*-axis) of the inequality *x* ≥ 0 and its graph. See figure 5.34(a).\n\nThus the solution region of the inequalities in (ii) is partially shown in figure 5.34(b). This region is the intersection of graphs in figure 5.33(a) and 5.34(a).\n\n## **EXERCISE 5.1**\n\n- **1.

While tackling a certain problem from every day life each linear inequality concerning the problem is named as problem constraint. The system of linear inequalities involved in the problem concerned are called problem constraints. The variables used in the system of linear inequalities relating to the problems of every day life are non-negative and are called non-negative constraints. These nonnegative constraints play an important role for taking decision. So these variables are called decision variables.\n\n### 5.5 Feasible solution set\n\nWe see that solution region of the inequalities in example 2 of Art 5.3 is not within the first quadrant. If the nonnegative constraints $x \\geq 0$ and $y \\geq 0$ are included with the system of inequalities given in the example 2, then the solution region is restricted to the first quadrant.\n\nIt is the polygonal region $A B C D E$ (including its sides) as shown in the figure 5.51.\n\nSuch a region (which is restricted to the first quadrant) is referred to as a feasible region for the set of given constraints. Each point of the feasible region is called a feasible solution of the system of linear inequalities (or for the set of a given constraints). A set consisting of all the feasible solutions of the system of linear inequalities is called a feasible solution set.\n\nExample 1. Graph the feasible region and find the corner points for the following system of inequalities (or subject to the following constraints).\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x-y \\leq 3 \\\\\n& x+2 y \\leq 6 \\\\\n& x \\geq 0, \\quad y \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolution: The associated equations for the inequalities\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x-y \\leq 3 \\quad \\text { (i) } \\quad \\text { and } x+2 y \\leq 6 \\quad \\text { (ii) } \\\\\n& \\text { are } x-y=3 \\quad \\text { (1) and } x+2 y=6 \\quad(2)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs the point $(3,0)$ and $(0,-3)$ are on the line (1), so the graph of $x-y=3$ is drawn by joining the points $(3,0)$ and $(0,-3)$ by solid line.\n\nSimilarly line (2) is graphed by joining the points $(6,0)$ and $(0,3)$ by solid line. For $x=0$ and $y=0$, we have;\n\n$$\n0-0=0 \\leq 3 \\text { and } 0+2(0)=0 \\leq 6\n$$\n\nso both the closed half-planes are on the origin sides of the lines (1) and (2). The intersection of these closed half-planes is partially displayed as shaded region in figure 5.52(a).\n\nFor the graph of *y* ≥ 0, see figure 5.33(b) of the example 3 of art 5.3.\n\nThe intersection of graphs shown in figures 5.52(a) and 5.33(b) is partially graphed as shaded region in figure 5.52(b).\n\nThe graph of *x* ≥ 0 is drawn in figure 5.34(a). The intersection of the graphs shown in figures 5.52(a) and 5.34(a) is graphed in figure 5.52(c).\n\nFinally the graph of the given system of linear inequalities is displayed in figure 5.52(d) which is the feasible region for the given system of linear inequalities. The points (0, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1) and (0, 3) are corner points of the feasible region.\n\n*version: 1.1*\n\n**Example 2.** A manufacturer wants to make two types of concrete. Each bag of Agrade concrete contains 8 kilograms of gravel (small pebbles with coarse sand) and 4 kilograms of cement while each bag of B-grade concrete contains 12 kilograms of gravel and two kilograms of cement. If there are 1920 kilograms of gravel and 480 kilograms of cement, then graph the feasible region under the given restrictions and find corner points of the feasible region.\n\n**Solution:** Let *x* be the number of bags of A-grade concrete produced and *y* denote the number of bags of B-grade concrete produced, then 8*x* kilograms of gravel will be used for A-grade concrete and 12*y* kilograms of gravel will be required for B-grade concrete so 8*x* + 12*y* should not exceed 1920, that is,\n\n$$8x + 12y \\leq 1920$$\n\nSimilarly, the linear constraint for cement will be\n\n$$4x + 2y \\leq 480$$\n\nNow we have to graph the feasible region for the linear constraints\n\n$$8x + 12y \\leq 1920$$\n$$4x + 2y \\leq 480, \\quad x \\geq 0, \\quad y \\geq 0$$\n\nTaking the one unit along *x*-axis and *y*-axis equal to 40 we draw the graph of the feasible region required.\n\nThe shaded region of figure 5.53(a) shows the graph of 8*x* + 12*y* ≤ 1920 including the nonnegative constraints *x* ≥ 0 and *y* ≥ 0.\n\nIn the figure 5.53(b), the graph of 4*x* + 2*y* ≤ 480 including the non-negative constraints *x* ≥ 0 and *y* ≥ 0 is displayed as shaded region.\n\nThe intersection of these two graphs is shown as shaded region in figure 5.53(c), which is the feasible region for the given linear constraints.\n\nThe point (0, 0), (120, 0), (60, 120) and (0, 160) are the corner points of the feasible region.\n\n**Example 3.

The portion of the graph of the system $$2x + y \\geq 2$$,\n\n$$x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0$$\n\nis displayed as shaded region in figure 5.54(b).\n\nThe graph of the system\n\n$$2x - 3y \\leq 6, \\quad 2x + y \\leq 2,$$\n$$x \\geq 0, \\quad y \\geq 0$$\n\nis the intersection of the graphs shown in figures 5.54(a) and 5.54(b) and it is partially displayed in figure 5.54(c) as shaded region.\n\n(b) The graph of system $$x + 2y \\leq 8, \\quad x \\geq 0, \\quad y \\geq 0$$ is a triangular region indicated in figure 5.45(d).\n\nThus the graph of the system\n\n$$2x - 3y \\leq 6$$\n$$2x + y \\geq 2$$\n$$x + 2y \\leq 8$$\n$$x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0$$\n\nis the intersection of the graphs shown in figures 5.54(c) and 5.54(d). It is the shaded region indicated in the figure 5.54(e).\n\n**Note:** The corner points of feasible region the set of constraints in (a) are (1, 0), (3, 0) and (0, 2) while the corner points of the feasible region for the set of constraints in (b) are (1, 0):\n\n$$(3, 0) \\left( \\frac{16}{7} \\cdot \\frac{10}{7} \\right), (0, 4) \\text{ and } (0, 2)$$\n\nWe see that the feasible solution regions in example 3(a) and 3(b) are of different types. The feasible region in example 3(a) is unbounded as it cannot be enclosed in any circle how large it may be while the feasible region in example 3(b) can easily be enclosed within a circle, so it is bounded. If the line segment obtained by joining any two points of a region lies entirely within the region, then the region is called **convex**.\n\nBoth the feasible regions of example 3(a) and 3(b) are convex but the regions such as shown in the adjoining figures are not convex.\n\n### EXERCISE 5.2\n\n**1.

Note that there are infinitely many feasible solutions in the feasible region. The feasible solution which maximizes or minimizes the objective function is called the **optimal solution**. The theorem of linear programming states that the maximum and minimum values of the objective function occur at corner points of the feasible region.\n\n#### Procedure for determining optimal solution:\n\n(i) Graph the solution set of linear inequality constraints to determine feasible region.\n\n(ii) Find the corner points of the feasible region.\n\n(iii) Evaluate the objective function at each corner point to find the optimal solution.\n\n**Example 1.** Find the maximum and minimum values of the function defined as:\n\n$$f(x, y) = 2x + 3y \\qquad \\text{subject to the constraints;}$$\n\n$$x - y \\leq 2 \\qquad x + y \\leq 4 \\qquad 2x - y \\leq 6, \\quad x \\geq 0$$\n\n**Solution.** The graphs of $$x - y \\leq 2$$ is the closed half plane on the origin side of $$x - y = 2$$ and the graph of $$x + y \\leq 4$$ is the closed half-plane not on the origin side of $$x + y = 4$$. The graph of the system\n\n$$x - y \\leq 2, x + y \\geq 4$$\n\n*version: 1.1*\n\nincluding the non-negative constraints *x* ≥ 0 is partially displayed as shaded region in the figure 5.61. The graph of 2*x* − *y* ≤ 6 consists of the graph of the line 2*x* − *y* = 6 and the half plane on the origin side of the line 2*x* − *y*=6. A portion of the solution region of the given system of inequalities is shaded in the figure 5.62.\n\nWe see that feasible region is unbounded upwards and its corner points are *A*(0, 4), *B*(3, 1) and *C*(4, 2). Note that the point at which the lines *x* + *y* = 4 and 2*x* − *y* = 6 intersect is not a corner point of the feasible region.\n\nIt is obvious that the expression 2*x* + 3*y* does not possess a maximum value in the feasible region because its value can be made larger than any number by increasing *x* and *y*. We calculate the values of *f* at the corner points to find its minimum value:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nf(0, 4) & = & 2(0) + 3 \\times 4 & = & 12 \\\\\nf(3, 1) & = & 2 \\times 3 + 3 \\times 1 & = & 6 + 3 = 9 \\\\\nf(4, 2) & = & 2 \\times 4 + 3 \\times 2 & = & 8 + 6 = 14\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThus the minimum value of 2*x* + 3*y* is 9 at the corner point (3, 1).\n\n**Notes:** If *f*(*x*, *y*) = 2*x* + 3*y*, then *f*(0, 4) = 2*x* 0 + 2*x* 4 = 8, *f*(3, 1) = 2*x* 3 + 2*x* 4 = 6 + 2 = 9 and (4, 2) = 2*x* 4 + 2*x* 2 = 8 + 4 = 12. The minimum value of 2*x* + 3*y* is the same, at two corner points (0, 4) and (3, 1).\n\nWe observe that the minimum value of 2*x* + 2*y* at each point of the line segment *AB* is 8 as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nf(x, y) & = & 2x + 2(4 - x) \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad ( \\cdot \\quad x + y = 4 \\Rightarrow y = 4 - x) \\\\\n& = & 2x + 8 - 2x = 8\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**Example 2.** Find the minimum and maximum values of *f* and *φ* defined as:\n\n$$\nf(x, y) = 4x + 5y, \\qquad \\phi(x, y) = 4x + 6y\n$$\n\nunder the constraints\n\n$$\n2x - 3y \\leq 6 \\qquad 2x + y \\geq 2 \\qquad 2x + 3y \\leq 12 \\qquad x \\geq 0, \\quad y \\geq 0\n$$\n\n**Solution.** The graphs of 2*x* − 3*y* ≤ 6, 2*x* + *y* ≥ 2, are displayed in the example 3 of Art. 5.5. Joining the points (6, 0) and (0, 4), we obtain the graph of the line 2*x* + 3*y* = 12. As 2(0) + 3(0) = 0 < 12, so the graph of 2*x* + 3*y* < 12 is the half plane below the line 2*x* + 3*y* = 12. Thus the graph of 2*x* + 3*y* ≤ 12 consists of the graph of the line 2*x* + 3*y* = 12 and the half plane below the line 2*x* + 3*y* = 12. The solution region of 2*x* − 3*y* ≤ 6, 2*x* + *y* ≥ 2 and 2*x* + 3*y* ≤ 12 is the triangular region *PQR* shown in figure 5.63. The non-negative constraints *x* ≥ 0, *y* ≥ 0 indicated the first quadrant. Thus the feasible region satisfying all the constraints is shaded in the figure 5.63 and its corner points are (1, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (9, 2, 1) and (3, 0).\n\nWe find values of *f* at the corner points.\n\n|  Corner point | *f*(*x*, *y*) = 4*x* + 5*y*  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (1, 0) | *f*(1, 0) = 4 *x* 1 + 5.0 = 4  |\n|  (0, 2) | *f*(0, 2) = 4 *x* 0 + 5.2 = 10  |\n|  (0, 4) | *f*(0, 4) = 4 *x* 0 + 5.4 = 20  |\n|  (9/2, 1) | *f*(9/2, 1) = 4 *x* 9/2 + 5.1 = 23  |\n|  (3, 0) | *f*(3, 0) = 4 *x* 3 + 5.0 *x* 0 = 12  |\n\nFrom the above table, it follows that the minimum value of *f* is 4 at the corner point (1, 0) and maximum value of *f* is 23 at the corner point (9, 2, 1). The values of *φ* at the corner points are given below in tabular form.\n\n|  Corner point | *φ*(*x*, *y*) = 4*x* + 5*y*  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (1, 0) | *φ*(1, 0) = 4.1 + 6.0 = 4  |\n|  (0, 2) | *φ*(0, 2) = 4.0 + 6.2 = 12  |\n|  (0, 4) | *φ*(0, 4) = 4.0 + 6.4 = 24  |\n|  (9/2, 1) | *φ*(9/2, 1) = 4.9/2 + 6.1 = 24  |\n|  (3, 0) | *φ*(3, 0) = 4 *x* 3 + 6.0 = 12  |\n\nThe minimum value of *φ* is 4 at the point (1, 0) and maximum value of *φ* is 24 at the corner points (0, 4) and (9, 2, 1). As observed in the above example, it follows that the function *φ* has maximum value at all the points of the line segment between the points\n\n(0, 4) and $\\left(\\frac{9}{3}, 1\\right)$.\n\nNote 1. Some times it may happen that each point of constraint line gives the optimal value of the objective function.\n\nNote 2. For different value of $k$, the equation $4 x+5 y=k$ represents lines parallel to the line $4 x+5 y=0$. For a certain admissible value of $k$, the intersection of $4 x+5 y=k$ with the feasible region gives feasible solutions for which the profit is $k$.\n\n### 5.7 LINEAR PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS\n\nConvert a linear programming problem to a mathematical form by using variables, then follow the procedure given in Art 5.6.\n\nExample 1: A farmer possesses 100 canals of land and wants to grow corn and wheat. Cultivation of corn requires 3 hours per canal while cultivation of wheat requires 2 hours per canal. Working hours cannot exceed 240. If he gets a profit of Rs. 20 per canal for corn and Rs. 15/- per canal for wheat, how many canals of each he should cultivate to maximize his profit?\n\nSolution: Suppose that he cultivates $x$ canals of corn and $y$ canals of wheat. Then constraints can be written as:\n\n$$ \\begin{aligned} & x+y \\leq 100 \\ & 3 x+2 y \\leq 240 \\end{aligned} $$\n\nNon-negative constraints are $x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0$. Let $P(x, y) x^{*}$ be the profit function, then\n\n$$ P(x, y)=20 x+15 y $$\n\nNow the problem is to maximize the profit function $P$ under the given constraints. Graphing the inequalities, we obtain the feasible region which is shaded in the figure 5.71. Solving the equations $x+y=100$ and $3 x+2 y=240$ gives $x=240-2(x+y)=240-200=40$ and $y=100-40=60$, that is; their point of intersection is $(40,60)$. The corner points of the feasible region are $(0,0),(0,100),(40,60)$ and $(80,0)$. Now we find the values of $P$ at the corner points.\n\n|  Corner point | $P(x, y)=20 x+15 y$  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  $(0,0)$ | $P(0,0)=20 \\times 0+15 \\times 0=0$  |\n|  $(0,100)$ | $P(0,100)=20 \\times 0+15 \\times 100=1500$  |\n|  $(40,60)$ | $P(40,60)=20 \\times 40+15 \\times 60=1700$  |\n|  $(80,0)$ | $P(80,0)=20 \\times 80+15 \\times 0=1600$  |\n\nFrom the above table, it follows that the maximum profit is Rs. 1700 at the corner point $(40,60)$. Thus the farmer will get the maximum profit if he cultivates 40 canals of corn and 60 canals of wheat.\n\nExam ple 2. A factory produces bicycles and motorcycles by using two machines $A$ and B. Machine $A$ has at most 120 hours available and machine $B$ has a maximum of 144 hours available. Manufacturing a bicycle requires 5 hours in machine $A$ and 4 hours in machine $B$ while manufacturing of a motorcycle requires 4 hours in machine $A$ and 8 hours in machine $B$. If he gets profit of Rs. 40 per bicycle and profit of Rs. 50 per motorcycle, how many bicycles and motorcycles should be manufactured to get maximum profit?\n\nSolution: Let the number of bicycles to be manufactured be $x$ and the number of motor cycles to be manufactured be $y$.\n\nThen the time required to use machine $A$ for $x$ bicycles and $y$ motorcycles is $5 x+4 y$ (hours) and the time required to use machine $B$ for $x$ bicycles and $y$ motorcycles in $4 x+8 y$ (hours). Thus the problem constraints are $5 x+4 y \\leq 120$\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text { And } & 4 x+8 y \\leq 144 \\ \\Rightarrow & 2 x+4 y \\leq 72 \\end{array} $$\n\nSince the numbers of articles to be produced cannot be negative, so $x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0$. Let $P(x, y)$ be the profit function, then $P(x, y)=40 x+50 y$. Now the problem is to maximize $P$ subject to the constraints:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 5 x+4 y \\leq 120 \\\\\n& 2 x+4 y \\leq 72 \\quad ; \\quad x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolving $5 x+4 y=120$ and $2 x+4 y=72$, gives $3 x=48 \\Rightarrow x=16$ and $4 y=72-2 x=72-32=40 \\Rightarrow y=10$.\n\nThus their point of intersection is $(16,10)$. Graphing the linear inequality constraints, the feasible region obtained is depicted in the figure 5.72 by shading. The corner points of the feasible region are $(0,0),(0,18),(16,10)$ and $(24,0)$. Now we find the values of $P$ at the corner points.\n\n|  Corner point | $P(x, y)=40 x+50 y$  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  $(0,0)$ | $P(0,0)=40 \\times 0+50 \\times 0=0$  |\n|  $(0,18)$ | $P(0,18)=40 \\times 0+50 \\times 18=900$  |\n|  $(16,10)$ | $P(16,10)=40 \\times 16+50 \\times 10=1140$  |\n|  $(24,0)$ | $P(24,0)=40 \\times 24+50 \\times 0=960$  |\n\nFrom the above table, it follows, that the maximum profit is Rs. 1140 at the corner point $(16,10)$. Manufacturer gets the maximum profit if he manufactures 16 bicycles and 10 motorcycles.\n\n## EXERCISE 5.3\n\n1.

A dealer wishes to purchase a number of fans and sewing machines. He has only Rs. 5760 to invest and has space atmost for 20 items. A fan costs him Rs. 360 and a sewing machine costs Rs. 240. His expectation is that the can sell a fan at a profit of Rs. 22 and a sewing machine at a profit of Rs. 18. Assuming that he can sell all the items that he can buy, how should he invest his money in order to maximize his profit?\n9. A machine can produce product $A$ by using 2 units of chemical and 1 unit of a compound or can produce product $B$ by using 1 unit of chemical and 2 units of the compound. Only 800 units of chemical and 1000 units of the compound are available. The profits per unit of $A$ and $B$ are Rs. 30 and Rs. 20 respectively, maximize the profit function.",

          "title": "Conic Sections\n\n## 6.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nConic sections or simply conics, are the curves obtained by cutting a (double) right circular cone by a plane. Let $R S$ be a line through the centre $C$ of a given circle and perpendicular to its plane. Let $A$ be a fixed point on $R S$. All lines through $A$ and points on the circle generate a right circular cone. The lines are called rulings or generators of the cone. The surface generated consists of two parts, called nappes, meeting at the fixed point $A$, called the vertex or apex of the cone. The line $\\boldsymbol{R} \\boldsymbol{S}$ is called axis of the cone.\n\nIf the cone is cut by a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone, then the section is a circle.\nThe size of the circle depends on how near the plane is to the vertex of the cone. If the plane passes through the vertex $A$, the intersection is just a single point or a point circle. If the cutting plane is slightly tilted and cuts only one nappe of the cone, the resulting section is an ellipse. If the intersecting plane is parallel to a generator of the cone, but intersects its one nappe only, the curve of intersection is a parabola. If the cutting plane is parallel to the axis of the cone and intersects both of its nappes, then the curve of intersection is a hyperbola.\n\nThe Greek mathematicians Apollonius' (260-200 B.C.) and Pappus (early fourth century) discovered many intersecting properties of the conic sections. They used the methods of Euclidean geometry to study conics. We shall not study conics from the point of view stated above, but rather approach them with the more powerful tools of analytic geometry.\n\nThe theory of conics plays an important role in modern space mechanics, occeangraphy and many other branches of science and technology.\n\nWe first study the properties of a Circle. Other conics will be taken up later.\n\n### 6.1.1 Equation of a Circle\n\nThe set of all points in the plane that are equally distant from a fixed point is called a circle. The fixed point is called the centre of the circle and the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle is called the radius of the circle.\n\nIf $C(h, k)$ is centre of a circle, $r$ its radius and $P(x, y)$ any point on the circle, then the circle, denoted $S(C ; r)$ in set notation is\n\n$$\nS(C ; r)=\\{P(x, y) \\mid \\overline{C P} \\mid r\\}\n$$\n\nBy the distance formula, we get\n\n$$\n|\\overline{C P}|=\\sqrt{(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}}=r\n$$\n\nor $\\quad(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$\nis an equation of the circle in standard form.\nIf the centre of the circle is the origin, then (1) reduces to\n\n$$\nx^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}\n$$\n\nIf $r=0$, the circle is called a point circle which consists of the centre only.\n\nLet $P(x, y)$ be any point on the circle (2) and let the inclination of $O P$ be $\\theta$ as shown in the figure. It is clear that\n\n$$\n\\left.\\begin{array}{l}\nx=r \\cos \\theta \\\\\ny=r \\sin \\theta\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe point $P(r \\cos \\theta, r \\sin \\theta)$ lies on (2) for all values of $\\theta$. Equations (3) are called parametric equations of the circle (2).\n\nExample 1: Write an equation of the circle with centre $(-3,5)$ and radius 7.\nSolution: Required equation is\n\n$$\n(x+3)^{2}+(y-5)^{2}=7^{2}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nx^{2}+y^{2}+6 x-10 y-15=0\n$$\n\n### 6.1.1 General Form of an Equation of a Circle\n\nTheorem: The equation\n\n$$\nx^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0\n$$\n\nrepresents a circle $g, f$ and $c$ being constants.\nEquation (1) can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\left(x^{2}+2 g x+g^{2}\\right)+\\left(y^{2}+2 f y+f^{2}\\right)=g^{2}+f^{2}-c\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n[x-(-g)]^{2}+\\left[y-(-f)\\right]^{2}=\\left(\\sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-c}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nwhich is standard form of an equation of a circle with centre $(-g,-f)$ and radius $\\sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-c}$.\nThe equation (1) is called general form of an equation of a circle.\n\n## Note:\n\n1. (1) is a second degree equation in which coefficient of each of $x^{2}$ and $y^{2}$ is 1 .\n2. (1) contains no term involving the product $x y$.\n\nThus a second degree equation in which coefficients of $x^{2}$ and $y^{2}$ are equal and there is no product term $x y$ represents a circle.\n\nIf three non-collinear points through which a circle passes are known, then we can find the three constants $f, g$ and $c$ in (1).\n\nExample 2: Show that the equation:\n\n$$\n5 x^{2}+5 y^{2}+24 x+36 y+10=0\n$$\n\nrepresents a circle. Also find its centre and radius.\nSolution: The given equation can be written as:\n\n$$\nx^{2}+y^{2}+\\frac{24}{5} x+\\frac{36}{5} y+2=0\n$$\n\nwhich is an equation of a circle in the general form. Here\n\n$$\ng=\\frac{12}{5} \\cdot f=\\frac{18}{5} \\cdot c=2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Thus centre of the circle }=(-g,-f)=\\left(\\frac{-12}{5}, \\frac{-18}{5}\\right) \\\\\n& \\text { Radius of the circle }=\\sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-c}=\\sqrt{\\frac{144}{25}+\\frac{324}{25}-2} \\\\\n& =\\sqrt{\\frac{418}{25}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{418}}{5}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### 6.1.2 Equations of Circles Determined by Given Conditions\n\nThe general equation of a circle $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0$ contains three independent constants $g, f$ and $c$, which can be found if the equation satisfies three given conditions. We discuss different cases in the following paragraphs.\n\n## 1. A Circle Passing Through Three Non-collincar Points.\n\nIf three non-collinear points, through which a circle passes, are known, then we can find the three independent constants $f, g$ and $c$ occurring in the general equation of a circle.\n\nExample 3: Find an equation of the circle which passes through the points $A(5,10), B(6,9)$ and $C(-2,3)$.\n\nSolution: Suppose equation of the required circle is\n\n$$\nx^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0\n$$\n\nSince the three given points lie on the circle, they all satisfy (1). Substituting the three points into (1), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 25+100+10 g+20 f+c=0 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad 10 g+20 f+c+125=0 \\\\\n& 36+81+12 g+18 f+c+117=0 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad 12 g+18 f+c+117=0 \\\\\n& 4+9-4 g+6 f+c=0 \\\\\n& \\quad-4 g+6 f+c+13=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow we solve the equations (2), (3) and (4).\nSubtracting (3) from (2), we have\n\n$$\n-2 g+2 f+8=0\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\ng-f-4 = 0 \\tag{5}\n$$\n\nSubtracting (4) from (2), we have.\n\n$$\n14g + 14f + 112 = 0 \\tag{6}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\ng + f + 8 = 0 \\tag{6}\n$$\n\nFrom (5) and (6), we have,\n\n$$\nf = -6 \\text{ and } g = -2.\n$$\n\nInserting the values of *f* and *g* into (2), we get *c* = 15\n\nThus equation of the circle is: *x*² + *y*² − 4*x* − 12*y* + 15 = 0\n\n### 2. A circle passing through two points and having its centre on a given line.\n\n**Example 4:** Find an equation of the circle having the join of *A* (*x*₁, *y*₁) and *B* (*x*₂, *y*₂) as a diameter.\n\n**Solution:** Since *AB* is a diameter of the circle, its midpoint is the centre of the circle. The radius of the circle is known and standard form of an equation of the circle may be easily written. However, a more elegant procedure is to make use of the plane geometry. If (*x*, *y*) is any point on the circle, then *m*⊥*APB* = 90°.\n\nThus the lines *AP* and *BP* are perpendicular to each other.\n\n$$\n\\text{Slope of } \\quad AP = \\frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{Slope of } \\quad BP \\quad \\frac{y - y_2}{x - x_2}\n$$\n\nBy the condition of perpendicularity of two lines, we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} \\times \\frac{y - y_2}{x - x_2} = 1\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n(x - x_1) (x - x_2) + (y - y_1)(y - y_2) = 0\n$$\n\nThis is required equation of the circle.\n\n### 3. A circle passing through two points and equation of tangent at one of these points is known.\n\n**Example 5:** Find an equation of the circle passing through the point (−2, −5) and touching the line 3*x* + 4*y* − 24 = 0 at the point (4, 3).\n\n**Solution:** Let the circle be\n\n$$\nx^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nThe points (−2, −5) and (4, 3) lie on it. Therefore\n\n$$\n-4g - 10f + c + 29 = 0 \\tag{2}\n$$\n\n$$\n8g + 6f + c + 25 = 0 \\tag{3}\n$$\n\nThe line\n\n$$\n3x + 4y - 24 = 0 \\tag{4}\n$$\n\nTouches the circle at (4, 3).\n\nA line through (4, 3) and perpendicular to (4) is\n\n$$\ny - 3 = \\frac{4}{3} (x - 4) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 4x - 3y - 7 = 0\n$$\n\nThis line being a normal through (4, 3) passes through the centre (−g, −f) of the circle (1). Therefore\n\n$$\n-4g + 3f - 7 = 0 \\tag{5}\n$$\n\nFrom (2) − (3), we get\n\n$$\n-12g - 16f + 4 = 0\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n3g + 4f - 1 = 0 \\tag{6}\n$$\n\nSolving (5) and (6), we have *g* = −1, *f* = 1. Inserting these values of *g* and *f* into (3), we find *c* = −23. Equation of the required circle is\n\n$$\nx^2 + y^2 - 2x + 2y - 23 = 0\n$$\n\n### 4. A circle passing through two points and touching a given line.\n\n**Example 6:** Find an equation of the circle passing through the points *A*(1, 2) and *B*(1, −2) and touching the line *x* + 2*y* + 5 = 0.\n\n**Solution:** Let *O*(*h, k*) be the centre of the required circle. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& |O A|=|O B|=\\text { radius of the circle. } \\\\\n& \\text { i.e., } \\quad(h-1)^{2}+(k-2)^{2}=(h-1)^{2}+(k+2)^{2} \\\\\n& \\text { or } 8 k=0 \\quad \\text { i.e., } k=0 \\\\\n& \\text { Hence }|O A|=|O B| \\\\\n& =\\sqrt{(h-1)^{2}+4}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow length of perpendicular from $(h, k)$ i.e., $(h, 0)$ to the line $x+2 y+5=0$ equals the radius of the circle and is given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{|h+5|}{\\sqrt{5}}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{|h+5|}{\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot|O A|=\\sqrt{(h-1)^{2}+4}$\nor $\\frac{(h+5)^{2}}{5}=(h-1)^{2}+4$ or $4 h^{2}-20 h=0 \\quad$ i.e., $h=0,5$\nThus centres of the two circles are at $(0,0)$ and $(5,0)$.\nRadius of the first circle $=\\sqrt{5} \\quad$; Radius of the second circle $=\\sqrt{20}$\nEquations of the circles are\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lll}\nx^{2}+y^{2}=5 & \\text { and } & (x-5)^{2}+y^{2}=20 \\\\\nx^{2}+y^{2}=5 & \\text { and } & x^{2}+y^{2}-10 x+5=0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n## EXERCISE 6.1\n\n1.

Find equations of the circles of radius 2 and tangent to the line $x-y-4=0$ at $A(1,-3)$.\n\n### 6.2 TANGENTS AND NORMALS\n\nA tangent to a curve is a line that touches the curve without cutting through it. We know that for any curve whose equation is given by $y=f(x)$ or $f(x, y)=0$, the derivative is slope of the tangent at any point $P(x, y)$ to the curve. The equation of the tangent to the curve can easily be written by the pointslope formula. The normal to the curve at $P$ is the line through $P$ perpendicular to the tangent to the curve at $P$. This method can be very\n\nconveniently employed to find equations of tangent and normal to the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0$ at the point $P\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$.\nHere $\\quad f\\left(x_{1} y\\right)=x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0$\nDifferentiating (1) w.r.t. $x$, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 2 x+2 y \\frac{d y}{d x}+2 g+2 f \\frac{d y}{d x}=0 \\text { or } \\quad \\frac{d y}{d x}=\\frac{x+g}{y+f} \\\\\n& \\left.\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right]_{x_{1}, y_{1}}=-\\frac{x_{1}+g}{y_{1}+f}=\\text { Slope of the tangent at }\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEquation of the Tangent at $P$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y-y_{1}=-\\frac{x_{1}+g}{y_{1}+f}\\left(x-x_{1}\\right) \\quad \\text { (Point-slope form) } \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad y\\left(y_{1}+f\\right)-y_{1}^{2}-y_{1} f=-x\\left(x_{1}+g\\right)+x_{1}^{2}+x_{1} g \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad x x_{1}+y y_{1}+g x+f y=x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}+g x_{1}+f y_{1} \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad x x_{1}+y y_{1}+g x+f y+g x_{1}+f y_{1}+c=x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}+g x_{1}+f y_{1}+g x_{1}+f y_{1}+c \\\\\n& \\text { (adding } g x_{1}+f y_{1}+c \\text { to both sides) } \\\\\n& x x_{1}+y y_{1}+g\\left(x+x_{1}\\right)+f\\left(y+y_{1}\\right)+c=0 \\\\\n& \\text { since } \\quad\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right) \\text { lies on (1) and so } \\\\\n& x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}+2 g x_{1}+2 f y_{1}+c=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $\\frac{\\left(x_{1}+y y_{1}+g\\left(x+x_{1}\\right)+f\\left(y+y_{1}\\right)+c=0\\right)}{x_{1}+g}$ is the required equation of the tangent.\nTo find an equation of the normal at $P$, we note that slope of the normal is\n\n$$\n\\frac{y_{1}+f}{x_{1}+g} \\quad \\text { (negative reciprocal of slope of the tangent) }\n$$\n\nEquation of the normal at $P\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ is\n\n$$\ny-y_{1}=\\frac{y_{1}+f}{x_{1}+g}\\left(x-x_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nor $\\quad \\frac{\\left(y-y_{1}\\right)\\left(x_{1}+g\\right)=\\left(x-x_{1}\\right)\\left(y_{1}+f\\right)}{x_{1}+g}$ is an equation of the normal at $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$.\n\n## Theorem:\n\nThe point $P\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ lies outside, on or inside the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0$ according as\n\n$$\nx_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}+2 g x_{1}+2 f y_{1}+c \\stackrel{\\infty}{\\times} \\mid 0\n$$\n\nProof. Radius $r$ of the given circle is\n\n$$\nr=\\sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-c}\n$$\n\nThe point $P\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ lies outside, on or inside the circle, according as:\n\n$$\nm[C P] \\stackrel{\\infty}{\\times} \\mid r\n$$\n\ni.e., according as: $\\quad \\sqrt{\\left(x_{1}+g\\right)^{2}+\\left(y_{1}+f\\right)^{2}} \\stackrel{\\infty}{\\times} \\sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-c}$\nor according as : $\\quad x_{1}^{2}+2 g x_{1}+g^{2}+y_{1}^{2}+f^{2}+2 f y_{1} \\stackrel{\\infty}{\\times} \\sqrt[2]{g^{2}+f^{2}-c}$\nor according as : $\\quad x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}+2 g x_{1}+2 f y_{1}+c \\stackrel{\\infty}{\\times} \\mid 0$.\nExample 1: Determine whether the point $P(-5,6)$ lies outside, on or inside the circle: $x^{2}+y^{2}+4 x-6 y-12=0$\n\nSolution: Putting $x=-5$ and $y=6$ in the left hand member of the equation of the circle, we get\n\n$$\n25+36-20-36-12=-7<0\n$$\n\nThus the point $P(-5,6)$ lies inside the circle.\nTheorem: The line $y=m x+c$ intersects the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}$ in at the most two points.\nProof: It is known from plane geometry that a line can meet a circle in at the most two points.\n\nTo prove it analytically, we note that the coordinates of the points where the line\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y=m x+c \\\\\n& \\text { intersects the circle } \\\\\n& x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nare the simultaneous solutions of the equations (1) and (2).\nSubstituting the value of $y$ from equation (1) into equation (2), we get\n\n$$\nx^{2}+(m x+c)^{2}=a^{2}\n$$\n\nor $\\quad x^{2}\\left(1+m^{2}\\right)+2 m c x+c^{2}-a^{2}=0$\nThis being quadratic in $x$, gives two values of $x$ say $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. Thus the line intersects the circle in at the most two points. For nature of the points we examine the discriminant of (3).\n\nThe discriminant of (3) is $\\left(2 m c\\right)^{2}-4\\left(1+m^{2}\\right)\\left(c^{2}-a^{2}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =4 m^{2} c^{2}-4\\left(1+m^{2}\\right)\\left(c^{2}-a^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& =4 m^{2} c^{2}-4 m^{2} c^{2}-4\\left(c^{2}-a^{2}-a^{2} m^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& =4\\left[-c^{2}+a^{2}\\left(1+m^{2}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThese points are\n(i) Real and distinct, if $a^{2}\\left(1+m^{2}\\right)-c^{2}>0$\n(ii) Real and coincident if $a^{2}\\left(1+m^{2}\\right)-c^{2}=0$\n(iii) Imaginary if $a^{2}\\left(1+m^{2}\\right)-c^{2}<0$\n\n## Condition that the line may be a tangent to the circle.\n\nThe line (1) is tangent to the circle (2) if it meets the circle in one point.\ni.e., if $c^{2}=a^{2}\\left(1+m^{2}\\right)$ or $\\varepsilon=\\alpha \\sqrt{1-m^{2}}$\nis the condition for (1) to be a tangent to (2).\nExample 2: Find the co-ordinates of the points of intersection of the line $2 x+y=5$ and the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 x-9=0$. Also find the length of the intercepted chord.\n\nSolution: From $2 x+y=5$, we have\n\n$$\ny=(5-2 x)\n$$\n\nInserting this value of $y$ into the equation of the circle, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x^{2}+(5-2 x)^{2}+2 x-9=0 \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad 5 x^{2}-18 x+16=0 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad x=\\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{324-320}}{10} \\quad \\frac{18 \\pm 2}{10} \\quad 2, \\frac{8}{5}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhen $x=2, y=5-4=1$\nWhen $x=\\frac{8}{5}, y=5-\\frac{16}{5}-\\frac{9}{5}$\n\nThus the points of intersection are $P(2,1)$ and $Q\\left(\\frac{8}{5}, \\frac{9}{5}\\right)$\nLength of the chord intercepted\n\n$$\n=\\sqrt[3]{P Q}=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{8}{5}-2\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{9}{5}-1\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{4}{25}-\\frac{16}{25}}=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\n$$\n\nTheorem: Two tangents can be drawn to a circle from any point $P\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$. The tangents are real and distinct, coincident or imaginary according as the point lies outside, on or inside the circle.\n\nProof: Let an equation of the circle be $x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}$\nWe have already seen that the line\n\n$$\ny=m x+a \\sqrt{1+m^{2}}\n$$\n\nis a tangent to the given circle for all values of $m$. If it passes through the point $P\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y_{1}=m x_{1}+a \\sqrt{1+m^{2}} \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad\\left(y_{1}-m x_{1}\\right)^{2}=a^{2}\\left(1+m^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad m^{2}\\left(x_{1}^{2}-a^{2}\\right)-2 m x_{1} y_{1}+y_{1}^{2}-a^{2}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis being quadratic in $m$, gives two values of $m$ and so there are two tangents from $P\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ to the circle. These tangents are real and distinct, coincident or imaginary according as the roots of (2) are real and distinct, coincident or imaginary\ni.e., according as $x_{1}^{2} y_{1}^{2}-\\left(x_{1}^{2}-a^{2}\\right)\\left(y_{1}^{2}-a^{2}\\right) \\stackrel{\\text { o }}{=} 0$\nor $\\quad x_{1}^{2} a^{2}+y_{1}^{2} a^{2}+a^{2} \\stackrel{\\text { o }}{=} 0 \\quad$ or $\\quad x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}-a^{2} \\stackrel{\\text { o }}{=} 0$\ni.e., according as the point $P\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ lies outside, on or inside the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}-a^{2}=0$\n\nExample 3: Write equations of two tangents from $(2,3)$ to the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=9$.\nSolution. Any tangent to the circle is\n\n$$\ny=m x+3 \\sqrt{1+m^{2}}\n$$\n\nIf it passes through $(2,3)$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 3=2 m+3 \\sqrt{1+m^{2}} \\\\\n\\text { or } & (3-2 m)^{2} \\equiv 9\\left(1+m^{2}\\right) \\\\\n\\text { or } & 9-12 m+4 m^{2} \\equiv 9+9 m^{2} \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad 5 m^{2}+12 m=0 \\quad \\text { i.e., } m=0, \\frac{-12}{5}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nInserting these values of $m$ into (1), we have equations of the tangents from $(2,3)$ to the circle as :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { For } m=0: y=0 . x+3 \\sqrt{1+0} \\\\\n& \\text { or } y=3 \\\\\n& \\text { For } m=\\frac{-12}{5}: y=\\frac{-12}{5} x+3 \\sqrt{1+\\frac{144}{25}}=\\frac{-12}{5} x+\\frac{39}{5} \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad 5 y+12 x-39=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 4: Write equations of the tangents to the circle\n\n$$\nx^{2}+y^{2}-4 x+6 y+9 \\equiv 0\n$$\n\nat the points on the circle whose ordinate is -2 .\n\nSolution: Substituting $y=-2$ into (1), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x^{2}-4 x+1 \\equiv 0 \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad x=\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4}}{2} \\quad \\pm 2 \\quad \\sqrt{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe points on the circle with ordinate -2 are\n\n$$\n(2+\\sqrt{3},-2),(2-\\sqrt{3},-2)\n$$\n\nEquations of the tangents to (1) at these points are\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (2+\\sqrt{3}) x-2 y-2(x+2+\\sqrt{3})+3(y-2)+9=0 \\\\\n& \\text { and } \\quad(2-\\sqrt{3}) x-2 y-2(x+2-\\sqrt{3})+3(y-2)+9=0 \\\\\n& \\text { i.e., } \\quad \\sqrt{3} x+y-2 \\sqrt{3}-1=0 \\\\\n& \\text { and } \\quad-\\sqrt{3} x+y+2 \\sqrt{3}-1=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## Example 5: $\\quad$ Find a joint equation to the pair of tangents drawn from $(5,0)$ to the circle: $x^{2}+y^{2}=9$\n\nSolution: Let $P(h, k)$ be any point on either of the two tangents drawn from $A(5,0)$ to the given circle (1). Equation of $P A$ is\n\n$$\ny-0=\\frac{k-0}{h-5}(x-5) \\quad \\text { or } k x-(h-5) y-5 k=0\n$$\n\nSince (2) is tangent to the circle (1), the perpendicular distance of (2) from the centre of the circle equals the radius of the circle.\ni.e., $\\quad \\frac{|-5 k|}{\\sqrt{k^{2}+(h-5)^{2}}}=3$\nor $\\quad 25 k^{2}=9\\left[k^{2}+(h-5)^{2}\\right]$ or $16 k^{2}-9(h-5)^{2}=0$\nThus $(h, k)$ lies on\n\n$$\n9(x-5)^{2}-16 y^{2} \\equiv 0\n$$\n\nBut $(h, k)$ is any point of either of the two tangents.\nHence (3) is the joint equations of the two tangents.\n\n### 6.2.1 Length of the tangent to a circle (Tangential Distance)\n\nLet $P\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ be a point outside the circle\n\n$$\nx^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c \\equiv 0\n$$\n\nWe know that two real and distinct tangents can be drawn to the circle from an external point $P$.

So, by definition\n\n$$\n\\frac{|P F|}{|P M|}=4 . \\quad \\text { or } \\quad|P F||P M|\n$$\n\nNow $|P M|=x+a$\nand $|P F|=\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+(y-0)^{2}}$\nSubstituting into (1), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+y^{2}}=x+a \\\\\n& (x-a)^{2}+y^{2}=(x+a)^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\ny^{2}=(x+a)^{2}-(x-a)^{2}=4 a x \\quad \\text { or } \\quad y^{2}=4 a x\n$$\n\nwhich is standard equation of the parabola.\n\n## Definitions\n\n(i) The line through the focus and perpendicular to the directrix is called axis of the parabola. In case of (2), the axis is $y=0$.\n(ii) The point where the axis meets the parabola is called vertex of the parabola. Clearly the equation (2) has vertex $A(0,0)$. The line through $A$ and perpendicular to the axis of the parabola has equation $x=0$. It meets the parabola at coincident points and so it is a tangent to the curve at $A$.\n(iii) A line joining two distinct points on a parabola is called a chord of the parabola. A chord passing through the focus of a parabola is called a focal chord of the parabola. The focal chord perpendicular to the axis of the parabola (1) is called latusrectum of the parabola. It has an equation $x=a$ and it intersects the curve at the points where\n\n$$\ny^{2}=4 a^{2} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad y= \\pm 2 a\n$$\n\nThus coordinates of the end points $L$ and $L^{\\prime}$ of the latusrectum are\n\n$$\nL(a, 2 a) \\text { and } L^{\\prime}(a,-2 a)\n$$\n\nThe length of the latusrectum is $\\left|L L^{\\prime}\\right|=4 a$.\n(iv) The point $\\left(a t^{2}, 2 a t\\right)$ lies on the parabola $y^{2}=4 a x$ for any real $t$.\n\n$$\nx=a t^{2}, y=2 a t\n$$\n\nare called parametric equations of the parabola $y^{2}=4 a x$.\n\n### 6.4.1 General Form of an Equation of a Parabola\n\nLet $F(h, k)$ be the focus and the line $l x+m y+n=0$ be the directrix of a parabola. An equation of the parabola can be derived by the definition of the parabola. Let $P(x, y)$ be a point on the parabola. Length of the perpendicular $P M$ from $P(x, y)$ to the directrix is given by;\n\n$$\n|P M|=\\frac{|l x+m y+n|}{\\sqrt{l^{2}+m^{2}}}\n$$\n\nBy definition, $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=\\frac{(l x+m y+n)^{2}}{l^{2}+m^{2}}$\nis an equation of the required parabola.\nA second degree equation of the form\n\n$$\na x^{2}+b y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0\n$$\n\nwith either $a=0$ or $b=0$ but not both zero, represents a parabola. The equation can be analyzed by completing the square.\n\n### 6.4.2 Other Standard parabolas\n\nThere are other choices for the focus and directrix which also give standard equations of parabolas.\n(i) If the focus lies on the $y$-axis with coordinates $F(0, a)$ and directrix of the parabola is $y=-a$, then equation of the parabola is\n\n$$\nx^{2}=4 a y\n$$\n\nThe equation can be derived by difinition.\n(ii) If the focus is $F(0,-a)$ and directrix is the line $y=a$, then equation of the parabola is\n\n$$\nx^{2}=-4 a y\n$$\n\nOpening of the parabola is upward in case of (3) and downward in case of (4). Both the curves are symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis.\nThe graphs of (3) and (4) are shown below.\n(iii) If the focus of the parabola is $F(-a, 0)$, and its directrix is the line $x=a$, then equation of the parabola is\n\n$$\ny^{2}=-4 a x\n$$\n\nThe curve is symmetric with respect to the $x$-axis and lies in the second and third quadrants only. Opening of the parabola is to the left as shown in the figure\n## **6.4.3 Graph of the Parabola**\n\n$$y^2 = 4ax$$\n\nWe note that corresponding to each positive value of *x* there are two equal and opposite values of *y*. Thus the curve is symmetric with respect to the *x*–axis. The curve passes through the origin and *x* = 0 is tangent to the curve at (0,0). If *x* is negative, then *y* is negative and so *y* is imaginary. Thus no portion of the curve lies on the left of the *y*–axis. As *x* increases, *y* also increases numerically so that the curve extends to infinity and lies in the first and fourth quadrants. Opening of the parabola is to the right of *y*–axis.\n\nSketching graphs of other standard parabolas is similar and is left as an exercise.\n\n|  **S.

Thus $P$ coincides with $A$ so that of all points on the parabola, its vertex $A$ is closest to the focus.\n\nExample 4. A comet has a parabolic orbit with the sun at the focus. When the comet is 100 million km from the sun, the line joining the sun and the comet makes an angle of $60^{\\circ}$ with the axis of the parabola. How close will the comet get to the sun?\n\nSolution. Let the sun $S$ be the origin. If the vertex of the parabola has coordinates $(-a, 0)$ then directrix of the parabola is\n\n$$\nx=-2 a, \\quad(a>0)\n$$\n\nif the comet is at $P(x, y)$, then\nby definition $|P S|=|P M|$\ni,e., $x^{2}+y^{2}=(x+2 a)^{2}$\nor $y^{2}=4 a x+4 a^{2}$ is orbit of the comet\nNow $|P S|=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$\n\n$$\n=x+2 a=100,000,000\n$$\n\nThe comet is closest to the sun when it is at $A$.\nNow $\\quad x=P S \\cos 60^{\\circ}$\n\n$$\n|x|=\\frac{|P S|}{2}=\\frac{x+2 a}{2}\n$$\n\nor $\\quad \\frac{x+2 a}{|x|}=\\frac{2}{1} \\quad$ or $\\quad \\frac{x+2 a}{2 a} \\quad 2=,(|x| \\quad|-2 a| \\quad 2 a)$\nor $\\quad \\frac{100,000,000}{2 a}=2$\nor $\\quad a=25,000,000$\nThus the comet is closest to the sun when it is $25,000,000 \\mathrm{~km}$ from the sun.\n\n## Reflecting Property of the parabola.\n\nA frequently used property of a parabola is its reflecting property. If a light source is placed at the focus of a parabolic reflecting surface then a light ray travelling from $F$ to a point $P$ on the parabola will be reflected in the direction $P R$ parallel to the axis of the parabola.\n\nThe designs of searchlights, reflecting telescopes and microwave antenas are based on reflecting property of the parabola.\n\nAnother application of the parabola is in a Suspension bridge. The main cables are of parabolic shape. The total weight of the bridge is uniformly distributed along its length if the shape of the cables is parabolic. Cables in any other shape will not carry the weight evenly.\n\nExample 6. A suspension bridge with weight uniformly distributed along the length has two towers of 100 m height above the road surface and are 400 m apart. The cables are parabolic in shape and are tangent to road surface at the centre of the bridge. Find the height of the cables at a point 100 m from the centre.\n\nSolution. The parabola formed by the $P$ cables $(1,200,100)$ has $A(0,0)$ as vertex and focus on the $y$-axis. An equation of this parabola is $x^{2}=4 a y$.\n\nThe point $Q(200,100)$ lies on the parabola and so\n\n$$\n(200)^{2}=4 a \\times 100\n$$\n\nor $\\quad a=100$\nThus an equation of the parabola is\n\n$$\nx^{2}=400 y\n$$\n\nTo find the height of the cables when $x=100$, we have from (1)\n\n$$\n(100)^{2}=400 y\n$$\n\nor $\\quad y=25$\nThus required height $=25 \\mathrm{~m}$\n\n## EXERCISE 6.4\n\n1.

(These angles are called respectively angle of incidence and angle of reflection).\n\n### 6.5 ELLIPSE AND ITS ELEMENTS\n\nWe have already stated that a conic section is an ellipse if $e<1$.\nLet $0<e<1$ and $F$ be a fixed point and $L$ be a fixed line not containing $F$. Let $P(x, y)$ be a point in the plane and $|P M|$ be the perpendicular distance of $P$ from $L$.\nThe set of all points $P$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{P F}{P M}\\right|=e\n$$\n\nis called an ellipse.\nThe number e is eccentricity of the ellipse, $F$ a focus and $L$ a directrix.\n\n### 6.5.1 Standard Form of an Ellipse\n\nLet $F(-c, 0)$ be the focus and line $x=\\frac{-c}{e^{2}}$ be the directix of an ellipse with eccentricity $e$, $(0<e<1)$. Let $P(x, y)$ be any point on the ellipse and suppose that $|P M|$ is the perpendicular distance of $P$ from the directrix. Then\n\n$$\n|P M|=x+\\frac{c}{e^{2}}\n$$\n\nThe condition $|P F|=e|P M|$ takes the analytic form\n\n$$\n(x+c)^{2}+y^{2}=e^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{c}{e^{2}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text { or } \\quad x^{2}+2 c x+c^{2}+y^{2}=e^{2} x^{2}+2 c x+\\frac{c^{2}}{e^{2}} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad x^{2}\\left(4 e^{2}\\right)+y^{2}=\\frac{e^{2}}{e^{2}}\\left(4 e^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nversion: 1.1\nor $\\quad x^{2}\\left(1-e^{2}\\right)+y^{2}=a^{2}\\left(1-e^{2}\\right)$. where $\\frac{c}{e} a$\nor $\\quad \\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{a^{2}\\left(1-e^{2}\\right)}=1$\nIf we write $b^{2}=a^{2}\\left(1-e^{2}\\right)$, then (1) takes the form\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\n$$\n\nwhich is an equation of the ellipse in the standard form.\nMoreover, eccentricity of the ellipse is $e=\\frac{c}{a}$.\nWe have $b^{2}=a^{2}\\left(1-e^{2}\\right)$\n(i) From the relation $b^{2}=a^{2}\\left(1-e^{2}\\right)$, we note that $b<a$\n(ii) Since we set $\\frac{c}{e}=a$, the focus $F$ has coordinates $(-a e, 0)$ and equation of the directrix is $x=\\frac{-a}{e}$.\n(iii) If we take the point $(a e, 0)$ as focus and the line $x=\\frac{a}{e}$ as directrix, it can be seen easily that we again obtain equation (2). Thus the ellipse (2) has two foci $(-a e, 0)$ and $(a e, 0)$ and two directrices $x=\\pm \\frac{a}{e}$.\n(iv) The point (acos $\\theta$, bsin $\\theta$ ) lies on (2) for all real $\\theta . x=\\operatorname{acos} \\theta, y=b \\sin \\theta$ are called parametric equations of the ellipse (2).\n(v) If in (2), $b=a$ then it becomes\n\n$$\nx^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}\n$$\n\nwhich is a circle. In this case $b^{2}=a^{2}\\left(1-e^{2}\\right)=a^{2}$ and so $e=0$. Thus circle is a special case of an ellipse with eccenctricty 0 and foci tending to the centre.\nDefinitions: Let $F^{\\prime}$ and $F$ be two foci of the ellipse\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\n$$\n\n- (i) The midpoint *C* of *FF'* is called the **centre** of the ellipse. In case of (1) coordinates of *C* are (0,0).\n- (ii) The intersection of (1) with the line joining the foci are obtained by setting *y* = 0 into (1). These are the points *A*<sup>0</sup>(*a*, 0) and *A*(*a*, 0). The points *A* and *A'* are called **vertices** of the ellipse.\n- (iii) The line segment *AA'* = 2*a* is called the **major axis** of the ellipse. The line through the centre of (1) and perpendicular to the major axis has its equation as *x* = 0. It meets (1) at points *B'* (0, *b*) and *B'* (0,−*b*). The line segment *BB'* = 2*b* is called the **minor axis** of the ellipse and *B'*, *B'* are some-times called the **covertices** of the ellipse. Since *b*<sup>2</sup> = *a*<sup>2</sup>(1 − *e*<sup>2</sup>) and *e* < 1, the length of the major axis is greater than the length of the minor axis. (See figure)\n- (iv) Foci of an ellipse always lie on the major axis.\n- (v) Each of the focal chords *LFL'* and *NF'N'* perpendicular to the major axis of an ellipse is called a **latusrectum** of the ellipse. Thus there are two **laterarecta** of an ellipse. It is an easy exercise to find that length of each latusrectum is *2b*<sup>2</sup> *a*. (See problem 5).\n- (vi) If the foci lie on the *y*–axis with coordinates (0,−*ae*) and (0,∂*e*), then equation of the ellipse is\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{b^2} + \\frac{y^2}{a^2} = 1. \\quad a > b.\n$$\n\nThe reader is urged to derive this equation.\n\n#### **6.5.2 Graph of an Ellipse**\n\nLet an equation of the ellipse be\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} > 1\n$$\n\nSince only even powers of both *x* and *y* occur in (1), the curve is symmetric with respect to both the axes.\n\nFrom (1), we note that\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} \\leq 1 \\text{ and } \\frac{y^2}{b^2} \\leq 1\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} \\leq a^2 \\text{ and } y^2 \\leq b^2\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n-a \\leq x \\leq a \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad -b \\leq y \\leq b\n$$\n\nThus all points of the ellipse lie on or within the rectangle (2). The curve meets the *x*-axis at *A*<sup>0</sup> (*a*, 0) and *A'* (*a*, 0) and it meets the *y*-axis at *B*(0,−*b*), *B'* (0, *b*). The graph of the ellipse can easily be drawn as shown in the following figure.\n\nThe graph of the ellipse\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{b^2} + \\frac{y^2}{a^2} = 1, \\quad a > b\n$$\n\ncan be sketched as in the case of (1).

Let $e>1$ and $F$ be a fixed point and $L$ be a line not containing $F$. Also let $P(x, y)$ be a point in the plane and $|P M|$ be the perpendicular distance of $P$ from $L$.\n\nThe set of all points $P(x, y)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{|P F|}{|P M|}=e>1\n$$\n\nis called a hyperbola.\n$F$ and $L$ are respectively focus and directrix of the hyperbola $e$ is the eccentricity.\n\n### 6.6.1 Standard Equation of Hyperbola\n\nLet $F(c, 0)$ be the focus with $c>0$ and $x=\\frac{c}{c^{2}}$ be the directrix of the hyperbola. Also let $P(x, y)$ be a point on the hyperbola, then by definition\n\n$$\n\\frac{|P F|}{|P M|}=e\n$$\n\ni.e. $(x-c)^{3}+y^{2}=e^{2}\\left(x-\\frac{c}{e^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\quad$ or $\\quad x \\frac{c}{e^{2}} \\quad 2 c \\neq \\quad c \\neq \\quad y \\frac{c}{e^{2}} \\quad e^{2} x \\frac{c}{e^{2}} \\quad 2 c \\neq \\quad \\frac{e^{2}}{a^{2}}$\nor $\\quad x^{2}\\left(e^{2}-1\\right)-y^{2}=c^{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e^{2}}\\right)=\\frac{c^{2}}{e^{2}}\\left(e^{2}-1\\right)$\nLet us set $a=\\frac{c}{e}$, so that (2) becomes\n$x^{2}\\left(e^{2}-1\\right)-y^{2}-a^{2}\\left(e^{2}-1\\right)=0-\\quad$ or $\\quad \\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} \\quad \\frac{y^{2}}{a^{2}\\left(e^{2}-1\\right)} \\quad 1$\nor $\\quad \\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$\nwhere $\\quad b^{2}=a^{2}\\left(e^{2}-1\\right) \\approx c^{2}-a^{2} \\quad \\because c=a e$\n(3) is standard equation of the hyperbola.\n\nIt is clear that the curve is symmetric with respect to both the axes.\nIf we take the point $(-c, 0)$ as focus\nand the line $x=\\frac{-c}{e^{2}}$ as directrix, then it is easy to see that the set of all points $P(x, y)$ such that\n\n$$\n|P F|=e|P M|\n$$\n\nis hyperbola with (3) as its equation.\nThus a hyperbola has two foci and two directrices.\n\nIf the foci lie on the $y$-axis, then roles of $x$ and $y$ are interchanged in (3) and the equation of the hyperbola becomes\n\n$$\n\\frac{y^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{x^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\n$$\n\nDefinition: The hyperbola\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\n$$\n\nmeets the $x$-axis at points with $y=0$ and $x= \\pm a$. The points $A(-a, 0$ and $A \\nmid a, 0)$ are called vertices of the hyperbola. The line segament $A A^{\\prime}=2 a$ is called the transverse (or focal) axis of the hyperbola (3). The equation (3) does not meet the $y$-axis in real points. However the line segment joining the points $B(0,-b)$ and $B^{\\prime}(0, b)$ is called the conjugate axis of the hyperbola. The midpoint $(0,0)$ of $A A^{\\prime}$ is called the centre of the hyperbola.\n\nIn case of hyperbola (3), we have\n\n$$\nb^{2}=a^{2}\\left(e^{2}-1\\right)=c^{2}-a^{2} \\text {. The eccentricity } e=\\frac{c}{a}>1\n$$\n\nso that, unlike the ellipse, we may have $b>a$ or $b<a$ or $b=a$\n(ii) The point ( $a$ sec $\\theta, b$ tan $\\theta$ ) lies on the hyperbola $\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$ for all real values of $\\theta$. The equations $x=a \\sec \\theta, y=b \\tan \\theta$ are called parametric equations of the hyperbola.\n(iii) Since $y= \\pm \\frac{b}{a} \\sqrt{x^{2}-a^{2}}$, when $|x|$, so that $x^{2} \\quad a^{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow$, we have\n\n$$\ny:=\\frac{b}{a} \\cdot x \\quad \\text { i.e. } \\quad \\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=0\n$$\n\nThe lines (2) do not meet the curve but distance of any point on the curve from any of the two lines approaches zero. Such lines are called asymptotes of a curve. Joint equation of the asymptotes of (3) is obtained by writing 0 instead of 1 on the right hand side of the standard form (3). Asymptotes are very helpful in graphing a hyperbola.\n\nThe ellipse and hyperbola are called central conics because each has a centre of symmetry.\n\n### 6.6.2 Graph of the hyperbola\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\n$$\n\nThe curve is symmetric with respect to both the axes. We rewrite (1) as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} \\quad 1 \\quad \\text { or } \\quad-y^{2} \\quad \\frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}\\left(x^{2} \\quad a^{2}\\right) \\cdot \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\pm y=\\frac{b}{a} \\sqrt{x^{2} \\quad a^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf $|x|<a$, then $y$ is imaginary so that no portion of the curve lies between $-\\alpha<x<\\alpha$. For $x \\geq a, y=\\frac{b}{a} \\sqrt{x^{2}-a^{2}} \\leq \\frac{b}{a} x$ so that points on the curve lie below the corresponding points on the line $y=\\frac{b}{a} x$ in first quadrant.\n\n$$\ny=\\frac{b}{a} \\sqrt{x^{2}-a^{2}} \\quad \\frac{-b}{a} x \\text { if } \\geq x \\quad a\n$$\n\nand in this case the points on the curve lie above the line $y=\\frac{-b}{a} x$ in fourth quadrant. If $x \\leq \\alpha$, then by similar arguments, $y=\\frac{b}{a} \\sqrt{x^{2}-a^{2}}$ lies below the corresponding point on $y=\\frac{-b}{a} x$ in second quadrant. If $y=\\frac{-b}{a} \\sqrt{x^{2}-a^{2}}$, then points on the curve lie above the correspondent point on $y=\\frac{b}{a} x$ in third quadrant. Thus there are two branches of the curve. Moreover, from (2) we see that as $|x| \\rightarrow \\infty,|y| \\rightarrow \\infty$ so that the two branches extend to infinity\n\n## Summary of Standard Hyperbolas\n\n|  Equation | $\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$ | $\\frac{y^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{z^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Foci | $(\\pm c, 0)$ | $(0, \\pm c)$  |\n|  Directrices | $x= \\pm \\frac{c}{e^{2}}$ | $y= \\pm \\frac{c}{e^{2}}$  |\n|  Transverse axis | $y=0$ | $x=0$  |\n|  Vertices | $( \\pm \\alpha, 0)$ | $(0, \\pm \\alpha)$  |\n|  Eccentricity | $e=\\frac{c}{a}>1$ | $e=\\frac{c}{a}>1$  |\n\nversion: 1.1\n\n|  Centre | $(0,0)$ | $(0,0)$  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Graph |  |   |\n|  |   |   |\n\nExample 1.

In order to find an equation of the tangent to a given\nconic at some point on the conic, we shall first find the slope of the tangent at the given point by calculating $\\frac{d y}{d x}$ from the equation of the conic at that point and then using the point - slope form of a line, it will be quite simple to write an equation of the tangent. Since the normal to a curve at a point on the curve is perpendicular to the tangent through the point of tangency, its equation can be easily written.\n\nExample 1.

An equation of the tangent the parabola at $(8,4)$ is\n\n$$\ny-4=x-8\n$$\n\nor $\\quad x-y-4=0$\nSlope of the normal at $(8,4)$ is -1 .

Inserting the value of $y$ from (1) into (2), we get\n\n$$\n(m x+c)^{2}=4 a x\n$$\n\nor $\\quad m^{2} x^{2}+(2 m c-4 a) x+c^{2}=0$\nwhich being a quadratic in $x$ gives two values of $x$. These values are the $x$ coordinates of the common points of (1) and (2). Setting these values in (1), we obtain the corresponding\nordinates of the points of intersection. Thus the line (1) cuts the parabola (2) in two points. In order that (1) is a tangent to (2), the points of intersection of a line and the parabola must be conicident. In this case, the roots of (3) should be real and equal.\nThis means that the discriminant of (3) is zero. Thus\n\n$$\n4(m c-2 a)^{2}-4 m^{2} c^{2}=0 \\quad \\text { i.e., } \\quad-4 m c a+4 a^{2}=0\n$$\n\nor $\\quad c=\\frac{a}{m}$, is. the required condition for (1) to be a tangent to (2).

The corresponding values of $y$ are obtained by setting the values of $x$ obtained from (3) into (1). Thus (1) and (2) intersect in two points. Now (1) is a tangent to (2) if the point of intersection is a single point.\nThis requires (3) to have equal roots. Hence (1) is a tangent to (2) if\n\n$$\n\\left(2 m c a^{2}\\right)^{2}-4\\left(a^{2} m^{2}+b^{2}\\right)\\left(a^{2} c^{2}-a^{2} b^{2}\\right)=0\n$$\n\ni.e., $\\quad m^{2} c^{2} a^{2}-\\left(a^{2} m^{2}+b^{2}\\right)\\left(c^{2}-b^{2}\\right)=0$\nor $\\quad m^{2} c^{2} a^{2}-a^{2} m^{2} c^{2}+a^{2} m^{2} b^{2}-b^{2} c^{2}+b^{4}=0$\nor $\\quad c^{2}=a^{2} m^{2}+b^{2}$\nor $\\quad c=\\sqrt{a^{2} m^{2} b^{2}}$.\nPutting the value of $c$ into (1), we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{x=m x \\sqrt{a^{2} m^{2} b^{2}}}{x}\n$$\n\nwhich are tangents to (2) for all non-zero values of $m$.\n\n(iii) We replace $b^{2}$ by $-b^{2}$ in (ii) and the line $y=m x+c$ is a tangent to\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 \\quad \\text { if } \\quad c=\\sqrt{a^{2} m^{2}-b^{2}}\n$$\n\nThus $y=m x \\sqrt{a^{2} m^{2}-b^{2}}$ are tangents to the hyperbola: $\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$ for all non-zero values of $m$.\n\nExample 4.

Also find the points of contact.\nSolution: The slope of the required tangents is $\\frac{-3}{8}$. Equations of the tangents are\n\n$$\ny=\\frac{-3}{8} x \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(128\\left(\\frac{-3}{8}\\right)^{2}+18=\\frac{-3}{8} x \\pm 6\\right.}\n$$\n\nThus the two tangents are\n\n$$\n3 x+8 y+48=0\n$$\n\nand $3 x+8 y-48=0$\nWe solve (1) and (3) simultaneously to find the point of contact. Inserting the value of $y$ from (3) into (1), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{x^{2}}{128}+\\frac{\\left(\\frac{-3}{8} x+6\\right)^{2}}{18}=1 \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\frac{x^{2}}{128}+\\frac{9}{64} \\frac{x^{2}+36}{18}-\\frac{9}{2} x \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad \\frac{x^{2}}{128}+\\frac{x^{2}}{128}+2-\\frac{x}{4}=1-\\text { or }=\\frac{x^{2}}{64}-\\frac{x}{4} \\quad 1 \\quad 0 \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad\\left(\\frac{x}{8}-1\\right)^{2}=0 \\quad \\text { i.e., } x=8 \\quad \\text { and so } \\quad \\frac{-3}{8} x \\quad 6 \\quad 3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $(8,3)$ is the point of tangency of $(3)$.\nIt can be seen in a similar manner that point of contact of (2) is $(-8,-3)$.\nExample 6.

It is known from algebra, that the simultaneous solution set of two equations of the second degree consists of four points. Thus two conics will always intersect in four points. These points may be all real and distinct, two real and two imaginary or all imaginary. Two or more points may also coincide. Two conics are said to touch each other if they intersect in two or more coincident points.\n\nExample 7.

The four points of intersection are as shown in the figure.\nExample 8. Find the points of intersection of the conics\n\n$$\ny=1+x^{2}\n$$\n\nand $\\quad y=1+4 x-x^{2}$\nAlso draw the graph of the conics.\nSolution. From (1), we have\n\n$$\nx=\\sqrt{y-1}\n$$\n\nInserting these values of $x$ into (2), we get\n\n$$\ny=1 \\pm 4 \\sqrt{y-1}-(y-1)\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n2 y-2= \\pm 4 \\sqrt{y-1} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad(y-1)^{2}=4(y-1)\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n(y-1)(y-1-4)=0\n$$\n\nTherefore, $\\quad y=1,5$\nWhen $\\quad y=1, x=0$\nWhen $\\quad y=5, x= \\pm 2$\n\nBut $(-2,5)$ does not satisfy (2).\nThus $(0,1)$ and $(2,5)$ are the points of intersections of (1) and (2). $y=1+x^{2}$ is a parabola with vertex at $(0,1)$ and opening upward, $y=1+4 x-x^{2}$ may be written as $y-5=-(x-2)^{2}$ which is a parabola with vertex. $(2,5)$ and opening downward\nExample 9.

The axes $O^{\\prime} X, O^{\\prime} Y$ drawn through $O^{\\prime}$ remain parallel to the original axes $O x$ and $O y$. The process is called translation of axes.\n\nWe have already obtained in Chapter 4 formulas showing relationships between the two sets of coordinates of a point referred to the two sets of coordinate axes.\n\nRecall that if a point $P$ has coordinates $(x$, $y)$ referred to the $x y$-system and has coordinates $(X, Y)$ referred to the translated axes $O^{\\prime} X, O^{\\prime} Y$ through $O^{\\prime}(h, k)$, then\n$$\n\\left.\\begin{array}{l}\nx=X+h \\\\\ny=T+k\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThese are called equations of transformation.\nFrom (1), we have\n\n$$\n\\left.\\begin{array}{l}\nX=x-h \\\\\nY=y-k\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n$$\n\n(1) and (2) will be used to transform an equation in one system into the other system. The axes $O x$ and $O y$ are referred to as the original (or old) axes and $O^{\\prime} X, O^{\\prime} Y$ are called the translated axes (or new axes).\n\nExample 1: Transform the equation $x^{2}+6 x-8 y+17=0$\nreferred to $O^{\\prime}(-3,1)$ as origin, axes remaining parallel to the old axes.\n\nSolution. Equations of transformation are\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x=X-3 \\\\\n& y=Y+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these values of $x, y$ into (1), we have\n\n$$\n(X-3)^{2}+6(X-3)-8(Y+1)+17=0\n$$\n\nor $\\quad X^{2}-6 X+9+6 X-18-8 Y-8+17=0$\nor $\\quad X^{2}-8 Y=0$ is the required transformed equation.\n\nExample 2: By transforming the equation\n\n$$\nx^{2}+4 y^{2}-4 x+8 y+4=0\n$$\n\nreferred to a new origin and axes remaining parallel to the original axes, the first degree terms are removed. Find the coordinates of the new origin and the transformed equation.\n\nSolution. Let the coordinates of the new origin be $(h, k)$. Equations of transformation are\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x=X+h \\quad, \\quad y=Y+k \\\\\n& \\text { Substituting these values of } x, y \\text { into (1), we get } \\\\\n& (X+h)^{2}+4(Y+k)^{2}-4(X+h)+8(Y+k)+4=0 \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\quad X^{2}+4 Y^{2}+X(2 h-4)+Y(8 k+8)+h^{2}+4 k^{2}-4 h+8 k+4=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$(h, k)$ is to be so chosen that first degree terms are removed from the transformed equation.\n\nTherefore, $2 h-4=0$ and $8 k+8=0$ giving $h=2$ and $k=-1$. New origin is $O^{\\prime}(2,-1)$. Putting $h=2, k=-1$ into (2), the transformed equation is $X^{2}+4 Y^{2}-4=0$.\n\n## Rotation of Axes\n\nTo find equations for a rotation of axes about the origin through an angle $\\theta(0<\\theta<90^{\\circ})$. (origin remaining unaltered).\n\nLet the axes be rotated about the origin through an angle $\\theta$. The new axes $O X, O Y$ are as shown in the figure.\n\nLet $P$ be any point in the plane with coordinates $P(x, y)$ referred to the $x y$-system and $P(X, Y)$ referred to the $X Y$-system. In either system the distance $r$ between $P$ and $O$ is the same. Draw $P M \\perp O x$ and $P Q \\perp O X$. Let $\\alpha$ be the inclination of $O P$ with $O X$.

Now we shall take up the general equation of second degree viz.\n\n$$\nA x^{2}+B y^{2}+G x+F y+C=0\n$$\n\nThe nature of the curve represented by (1) can be determined by examining the coefficients $A, B$ in the above equation.

Assume $A \\neq 0$ and $B=0$.\nThe equation (1) becomes $A x^{2}+G x+F y+C=0$\nor $\\quad A\\left(x^{2}+\\frac{G}{A} x+\\frac{G^{2}}{4 A^{2}}\\right)=-F y-C+\\frac{G^{2}}{4 A}$\nor $\\quad A\\left(x+\\frac{G}{2 A}\\right)^{2}=-F\\left(y+\\frac{C}{F}-\\frac{G^{2}}{4 A F}\\right)$\nor $\\quad A X^{2}=-F Y$, where $X=x+\\frac{G}{2 A}, \\quad Y=y+\\frac{C}{F}-\\frac{G^{2}}{4 A F}$\nwhich is standard equation of a parabola in $X Y$-coordinates system.\nWe summarize these results as under:\nLet an equation of second degree be of the form $A x^{2}+B y^{2}+G x+F y+C=0$. It represents:\n(i) a circle if $A=B \\neq 0$\n(ii) an ellipse if $A \\neq B$ and both are of the same sign\n(iii) a hyperbola if $A \\neq B$ and both are of opposite signs\n(iv) a parabola if either $A=0$ or $B=0$.\n\n### 6.9.1 Classification of Conics by the Discriminant\n\nThe most general equation of the second degree\n\n$$\n\\alpha x^{2}+2 h x y+b y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0\n$$\n\nrepresents a conic.

          "title": "Vectors\n\n## 7.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn physics, mathematics and engineering, we encounter with two important quantities, known as **\"Scalars and Vectors\"**.\n\nA **scalar quantity**, or simply a **scalar**, is one that possesses only magnitude. It can be specified by a number along with unit. In Physics, the quantities like mass, time, density, temperature, length, volume, speed and work are examples of scalars.\n\nA **vector quantity**, or simply a **vector**, is one that possesses both magnitude and direction. In Physics, the quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration, weight, force, momentum, electric and magnetic fields are examples of vectors.\n\nIn this section, we introduce vectors and their fundamental operations we begin with a geometric interpretation of vector in the plane and in space.\n\n### 7.1.1 Geometric Interpretation of Vector\n\nGeometrically, a vector is represented by a directed line segment $$A B$$ with $$A$$ its initial point and $$B$$ its terminal point. It is often found convenient to denote a vector by an arrow and is written either as $$A B$$ or as a boldface symbol like $$v$$ or in underlined form $$\\underline{v}$$.\n\n- (i) The magnitude or length or norm of a vector $$A B$$ or $$\\underline{v}$$ is its absolute value and is written as $$A B$$ or simply $$A B$$ or $$\\mid \\underline{v}$$.\n- (ii) A unit vector is defined as a vector whose magnitude is unity. Unit vector of vector $$\\underline{v}$$ is written as $$\\underline{v}$$ (read as $$\\underline{v}$$ hat) and is defined by $$\\underline{v} = \\frac{\\underline{v}}{\\mid \\underline{v}}$$.\n\n- (iii) If terminal point $$B$$ of a vector $$A B$$ coincides with its initial point $$A$$, then magnitude $$A B = 0$$ and $$A B = 0$$, which is called zero or null vector.\n- (iv) Two vectors are said to be negative of each other if they have same magnitude but opposite direction.\n\nIf $$A B = \\underline{v}, \\quad \\text{then} \\quad B A = -AB = -\\underline{v}$$\n\nand $$B A = -AB$$\n\n### 7.1.2 Multiplication of Vector by a Scalar\n\nWe use the word scalar to mean a real number. Multiplication of a vector $$\\underline{v}$$ by a scalar $$k$$ is a vector whose magnitude is $$k$$ times that of $$\\underline{v}$$. It is denoted by $$k \\underline{v}$$.\n\n- (i) If $$k$$ is $$\\rightarrow$$ve, then $$\\underline{v}$$ and $$k \\underline{v}$$ are in the same direction.\n- (ii) If $$k$$ is $$\\rightarrow$$ve, then $$\\underline{v}$$ and $$k \\underline{v}$$ are in the opposite direction.\n\n#### (a) Equal Vectors\n\nTwo vectors $$A B$$ and $$\\underline{v}$$ are said to be equal, if they have the same magnitude and same direction i.e., $$A B = \\overline{C D}$$\n\n#### (b) Parallel Vectors\n\nTwo vectors are parallel if and only if they are non-zero scalar multiple of each other, (see figure).\n\n### 7.1.3 Addition and Subtraction of Two Vectors\n\nAddition of two vectors is explained by the following two laws:\n\n#### (i) Triangle Law of Addition\n\nIf two vectors *u* and *v* are represented by the two sides *AB* and *BC* of a triangle such that the terminal point of *u* coincide with the initial point of *v*, then the third side *AC* of the triangle gives vector sum *u* + *v*, that is\n\n$$\n\\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{BC} = \\overrightarrow{AC} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\underline{u} + \\underline{v} = \\overrightarrow{AC}\n$$\n\n### **(ii) Parallelogram Law of Addition**\n\nIf two vectors *u* and *v* are represented by two adjacent sides *AB* and *AC* of a parallelogram as shown in the figure, then diagonal *AD* gives the sum or resultant of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$, that is\n\n$$\n\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\overrightarrow{AB} + \\overrightarrow{AC} = \\underline{u} + \\underline{v}\n$$\n\n### **Note:** This law was used by Aristotle to describe the combined action of two forces.\n\n### **(b) Subtraction of two vectors**\n\nThe difference of two vectors $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$ is defined by\n\n$$\n\\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AC} = \\overrightarrow{AB} + (- \\overrightarrow{AC})\n$$\n\n$$\n\\underline{u} - \\underline{v} = \\underline{u} + (- \\underline{v})\n$$\n\nIn figure, this difference is interpreted as the main diagonal of the parallelogram with sides $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $-\\overrightarrow{AC}$. We can also interpret the same vector difference as the third side of a triangle with sides $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$. In this second interpretation, the vector difference $\\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AC} = \\overrightarrow{CB}$ points the terminal point of the vector from which we are subtracting the second vector.\n\n### **7.1.4 Position Vector**\n\nThe vector, whose initial point is the origin *O* and whose terminal point is *P*, is called the position vector of the point *P* and is written as $\\overrightarrow{OP}$.\n\nThe position vectors of the points *A* and *B* relative to the origin *O* are defined by $\\overrightarrow{OA} = \\underline{o}$ and $\\overrightarrow{OB} = \\underline{b}$ respectively. In the figure, by triangle law of addition,\n\n$$\n\\overrightarrow{OA} + \\overrightarrow{AB} = \\overrightarrow{OB}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\underline{o} + \\overrightarrow{AB} = \\underline{b}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Rightarrow \\overrightarrow{AB} = \\underline{b} \\quad \\underline{o}\n$$\n\n### **7.1.5 Vectors in a Plane**\n\nLet *R* be the set of real numbers. The Cartesian plane is defined to be the *R*<sup>2</sup> = {(*x*, *y*) : *x*, *y* ∈ *R*}.\n\nAn element (*x*, *y*) ∈ *R*<sup>2</sup> represents a point *P*(*x*, *y*) which is uniquely determined by its coordinate *x* and *y*. Given a vector *u* in the plane, there exists a unique point *P*(*x*, *y*) in the plane such that the vector $\\overrightarrow{OP}$ is equal to *u* (see figure). So we can use rectangular coordinates (*x*, *y*) for *P* to associate a unique ordered pair [*x*, *y*] to vector *u*.\n\nWe define addition and scalar multiplication in *R*<sup>2</sup> by:\n\n- **(i) Addition:** For any two vectors $\\underline{u} = [x, y]$ and $\\underline{v} = [x', y']$, we have\n  $$\n  \\underline{u} + \\underline{v} = [x, y] + [x', y'] = [x + x', y + y']\n  $$\n\n- **(ii) Scalar Multiplication:** For $\\underline{u} = [x, y]$ and $\\alpha \\in R$, we have\n  $$\n  \\alpha \\underline{u} = \\alpha [x, y] = [\\alpha x, \\alpha y]\n  $$\n\n**Definition:** The set of all ordered pairs [*x*, *y*] of real numbers, together with the rules of addition and scalar multiplication, is called the set of **vectors** in *R*<sup>2</sup>.\n\n*version: 1.1*\n\nFor the vector **u** = [**x, y**], **x** and **y** are called the components of **u**.\n\n**Note:** The vector [**x, y**] is an ordered pair of numbers, not a point (**x, y**) in the plane.\n\n### (a) Negative of a Vector\n\nIn scalar multiplication (ii), if α = −1 and **u** = [**x, y**] then\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathbf{H}} = (-1) \\{\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\} = \\{-x, -y\\}\n$$\n\nwhich is denoted by **−u** and is called the **additive inverse** of **u** or **negative vector** of **u**.\n\n### (b) Difference of two Vectors\n\nWe define **u** − **v** as **u** + (**−v**)\nIf **u** = [**x, y**] and **v** [**x', y']**, then\n**u** − **v** = **u** + (**−v**)\n  = [**x, y**] + [**−x' − y']** = [**x − x', y − y']**\n\n### (c) Zero Vector\n\nClearly **u** + (**−u**) = [**x, y**] + [**−x, −y**] = [**x − x, y − y**] = [0, 0] = 0.\n**0** = [0, 0] is called the **Zero (Null) vector**.\n\n### (d) Equal Vectors\n\nTwo vectors **u** = [**x, y**] and **v** = [**x', y']** of **R²** are said to be equal if and only if they have the same components. That is,\n\n$$\n[x, y] = [x', y'] \\text{ if and only if } x = x' \\text{ and } y = y'\n$$\n\nand we write **u** = **v**.\n\n### (e) Position Vector\n\nFor any point **P(x, y)** in **R²**, a vector **u** = [**x, y**] is represented by a directed line segment **OP**, whose initial point is at origin. Such vectors are called position vectors because they provide a unique correspondence between the points (positions) and vectors.\n\n### (f) Magnitude of a Vector\n\nFor any vector **u** = [**x, y**] in **R²**, we define the **magnitude** or **norm** or **length** of the vector as of the point **P(x, y)** from the origin **O**.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n\\therefore & \\text{Magnitude of } \\overrightarrow{OP} = |\\overrightarrow{OP}| & \\text{in} & \\sqrt{x^2 - y^2} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n### 7.1.6 Properties of Magnitude of a Vector\n\nLet **v** be a vector in the plane or in space and let **c** be a real number, then\n\n(i) **v** ≥ 0, and **v** = 0 if and only if **v** = 0\n\n(ii) **cv** = |**c**| **v**|\n\n**Proof:** (i) We write vector **v** in component form as **v** = [**x, y**], then\n\n$$\n|\\mathbf{v}| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\geq 0 \\text{ for all } x \\text{ and } y.\n$$\n\nFurther **v** = √(x^2 + y^2) = 0 if and only if **x** = 0, **y** = 0\n\nIn this case **v** = [0, 0] = 0\n\n(ii) **cv** = |**cx, cy**| = √(cx)^2 + (cy)^2 = √(cx)^2 √(x^2 + y^2) = |**c**| **v**|\n\n### 7.1.7 Another notation for representing vectors in plane\n\nWe introduce two special vectors,\n\n$$\ni = [1, 0], \\quad j = [0, 1] \\text{ in } R^2\n$$\n\nAs magnitude of **i** = √(1^2 + 0^2) = 1\n\n$$\n\\text{magnitude of } j = \\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2} = 1\n$$\n\nSo **i** and **j** are called unit vectors along **x**-axis, and along **y**-axis respectively. Using the definition of addition and scalar multiplication, the vector [**x, y**] can be written as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{u} &= [x, y] = [x, 0] + [0, y] \\\\\n&= x[1, 0] + y[0, 1] \\\\\n&= xi + y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus each vector [**x, y**] in **R²** can be uniquely represented by **xi + y**.\n\nIn terms of unit vector **i** and **j**, the sum **u + v** of two vectors\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{u} &= [x, y] \\text{ and } \\mathbf{v} \\quad [x', y'] \\text{ is written as} \\\\\n\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} &= [x + x', y + y'] \\\\\n&= (x + x')i + (y + y')j\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n**version: 1.1**\n\n7.1.8 A unit vector in the direction of another given vector.\n\nA vector $\\underline{u}$ is called a unit vector, if $|\\underline{u}|=1$\nNow we find a unit vector $u$ in the direction of any other given vector $\\underline{v}$.\nWe can do by the use of property (ii) of magnitude of vector, as follows:\n$\\therefore \\quad\\left|\\frac{1}{|\\underline{v}|}\\right|=\\frac{1}{|\\underline{v}||\\underline{v}|}=1$\n$\\therefore \\quad$ the vector $\\underline{v}=\\frac{1}{|\\underline{v}|} \\underline{v}$ is the required unit vector\nIt points in the same direction as $v$, because it is a positive scalar multiple of $\\underline{v}$.\n\n## Example 1:\n\nFor $\\underline{v}=[1,-3]$ and $\\underline{w}=[2,5]$\n(i) $\\underline{v}+\\underline{w}=[1,-3]+[2,5]=[1+2,-3+5]=[3,2]$\n(ii) $4 \\underline{v}+2 \\underline{w}=[4,-12]+[4,10]=[8,-2]$\n(iii) $\\underline{v}-\\underline{w}=[1,-3]-[2,5]=[1-2,-3-5]=[-1,-8]$\n(iv) $\\underline{v}-\\underline{v}=[1-1,-3+3]=[0,0]=0$\n(v) $|\\underline{v}|=\\sqrt{(1)^{2}+(-3)^{2}}=\\sqrt{1+9}=\\sqrt{10}$\n\nExample 2: Find the unit vector in the same direction as the vector $\\underline{v}=[3,-4]$.\nSolution: $\\quad \\underline{v}=[3,-4]=3(-4 \\underline{j})$\n\n$$\n|\\underline{v}|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5\n$$\n\nNow $\\quad \\underline{u}=\\frac{1}{|\\underline{v}|} \\underline{v}=\\frac{1}{3}[3,-4] \\quad$ ( $\\underline{u}$ is unit vector in the direction of $v$ )\n\n$$\n=\\left[\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{-4}{5}\\right]\n$$\n\nVerification: $|\\underline{u}|=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{-4}{5}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{25}+\\frac{16}{25}}=1$\n\n$$\n\\underline{v}=[3,-4]=3(-4 \\underline{j})\n$$\n\nExample 3: Find a unit vector in the direction of the vector\n(i) $\\underline{v}=2 i+6 \\underline{j}$\n(ii) $\\underline{v}=[-2,4]$\n\nSolution: (i) $\\underline{v}=2 i+6 \\underline{j}$\n\n$$\n|\\underline{v}|=\\sqrt{(2)^{2}+(6)^{2}}=\\sqrt{4+36}=\\sqrt{40}\n$$\n\n$\\therefore \\quad$ A unit vector in the direction of $\\underline{v}=\\frac{\\underline{v}}{|\\underline{v}|} \\quad \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{40}} i \\quad \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{40}} \\underline{j} \\quad \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} i \\quad \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}} \\underline{j}$\n(ii) $\\underline{v}=[-2,4]=-2 i+4 \\underline{j}$\n\n$$\n|\\underline{v}|=\\sqrt{(-2)^{2}+(4)^{2}}=\\sqrt{4+16}=\\sqrt{20}\n$$\n\n$\\therefore \\quad$ A unit vector in the direction of $\\underline{v}=\\frac{\\underline{v}}{|\\underline{v}|} \\quad \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{20}} i \\quad \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{20}} \\underline{j} \\quad \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{5}} i \\quad \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\underline{j}$\n\nExample 4: If $A B C D$ is a parallelogram such that the points $A, B$ and $C$ are respectively $(-2,-3),(1,4)$ and $(0,-5)$.

If a point $P$ divides $A B$ in the ratio $p: q$, then the position vector of $P$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\underline{r}=\\frac{q \\underline{a}+p \\underline{b}}{p+\\underline{q}}\n$$\n\nProof: Given $\\underline{a}$ and $\\underline{b}$ are position vectors of the points $A$ and $B$ respectively. Let $r$ be the position vector of the point $P$ which divides the line segment $A B$ in the ratio $p: q$. That is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& m \\overline{A P}: m \\overline{P B}=p: q \\\\\n& \\text { So } \\quad \\frac{m \\overline{A P}}{m \\overline{P B}}=\\frac{p}{q} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad q(m \\overline{A P})=p(m \\overline{P B}) \\\\\n& \\text { Thus } \\quad q(\\overline{A P})=p(\\overline{P B}) \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad q(\\underline{r}-\\underline{a})=p(\\underline{b}-\\underline{r}) \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad q \\underline{r}-q \\underline{a}=p \\underline{b}-p \\underline{r} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad p \\underline{r}+q \\underline{r}=q \\underline{a}+p \\underline{b} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad \\underline{r}(p+q)=q \\underline{a}+p \\underline{b} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\quad \\underline{r}=\\frac{q \\underline{a}+p \\underline{b}}{q+p}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCorollary: If $P$ is the mid point of $A B$, then $p: q \\equiv 1: 1$\n\n$$\n\\therefore \\text { positive vector of } P=\\underline{r} \\quad \\frac{\\underline{a}+\\underline{b}}{2}\n$$\n\n### 7.1.10 Vector Geometry\n\nLet us now use the concepts of vectors discussed so far in proving Geometrical Theorems. A few examples are being solved here to illustrate the method.\n\nExample 5: If $\\underline{a}$ and $\\underline{b}$ be the p.vs of $A$ and $B$ respectively w.r.t. origin $O$, and $C$ be a point on $\\overline{A B}$ such that $\\overline{O C}=\\frac{a+b}{2}$, then show that $C$ is the mid-point of $A B$.\n\nSolution: $\\quad \\overline{O A}=\\underline{a}, \\overline{O B}=\\underline{b}$ and $\\overline{O C}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\underline{a}+\\underline{b})$\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Now } \\quad 2 \\overline{O C}=\\underline{a}+\\underline{b} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\overline{O C}+\\overline{O C}=\\overline{O A}+\\overline{O B} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\overline{O C}-\\overline{O A}=\\overline{O B}-\\overline{O C} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\overline{O C}+\\overline{A O}=\\overline{O B}+\\overline{C O} \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\overline{A O}+\\overline{O C}=\\overline{C O}+\\overline{O B} \\\\\n& \\therefore \\quad \\overline{A C}=\\overline{C B} \\\\\n& \\text { Thus } m \\overline{A C}=m \\overline{C B}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n- $C$ is equidistant from $A$ and $B$, but $A, B, C$ are collinear. Hence $C$ is the mid point of $A B$.\n\nExample 6: Use vectors, to prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.\n\nSolution: Let the vertices of the parallelogram be $A, B, C$ and $D$ (see figure)\nSince $\\overline{A C}=\\overline{A B}+\\overline{A D}$, the vector from $A$ to the mid point of diagonal $\\overline{A C}$ is\n\n$$\n\\underline{v}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\overline{A B}+\\overline{A D})\n$$\n\nSince $\\overline{D B}=\\overline{A B}-\\overline{A D}$, the vector from $A$ to the mid point of diagonal $\\overline{D B}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\underline{w}=\\overline{A D}+\\frac{1}{2}(\\overline{A B}-\\overline{A D}) \\\\\n& =\\overline{A D}+\\frac{1}{2} \\overline{A B}-\\frac{1}{2} \\overline{A D} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2}(\\overline{A B}+\\overline{A D}) \\\\\n& =\\underline{\\underline{v}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $\\underline{v}=\\underline{w}$, these mid points of the diagonals $\\overline{A C}$ and $\\overline{D B}$ are the same. Thus the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.\n\n## EXERCISE 7.1\n\n1.

When sketching figures, we follow the convention that the positive $y$ $x$-axis points towards the reader, the positive $y$-axis to the right and the positive $z$-axis points upwards.\n\nThese axis are also labeled in accordance with the right hand rule. If fingers of the right hand, pointing in the direction of positive $x$-axis, are curled toward the positive $y$-axis, then the thumb will point in the direction of positive $z$-axis, perpendicular to the $x y$-plane. The broken lines in the figure represent the negative axes.\n\nA point $P$ in space has three coordinates, one along $x$-axis, the second along $y$-axis and the third along $z$-axis. If the distances along $x$-axis, $y$-axis and $z$-axis respectively are $a, b$, and $c$, then the point $P$ is written with a unique triple of real numbers as $P=(a, b, c)$ (see figure).\nright hand rule\nversion: 1.1\n\n# 7.2.1 Concept of a vector in space\n\nThe set *R*^3 = ((*x*, *y*, *z*) : *x*, *y*, *z* ∈ *R*) is called the 3-dimensional space. An element (*x*, *y*, *z*) of *R*^3 represents a point *P*(*x*, *y*, *z*), which is uniquely determined by its coordinates *x*, *y* and *z*. Given a vector *u* in space, there exists a unique point *P*(*x*, *y*, *z*) in space such that the vector *∂P* is equal to *u* (see figure).\n\nNow each element (*x*, *y*, *z*) ∈ *P*^3 is associated to a unique ordered triple [*x*, *y*, *z*], which represents the vector *u* = *∂P* = [*x*, *y*, *z*].\n\nWe define addition and scalar multiplication in *R*^3.\n\nby:\n\n- (i) **Addition:** For any two vectors *u* = [*x*, *y*, *z*] and *v* = [*x'*, *y'*, *z'*], we have\n\n  *u* + *v* = [*x*, *y*, *z*] + [*x'*, *y'*, *z'*] = [*x* + *x'*, *y* + *y'*, *z* + *z'*]\n\n- (ii) **Scalar Multiplication:** For *u* = [*x*, *y*, *z*] and *α* ∈ *R*, we have\n\n  *αu* = *α*[*x*, *y*, *z*] = [*αx*, *αy*, *αz*]\n\n**Definition:** The set of all ordered triples [*x*, *y*, *z*] of real numbers, together with the rules of addition and scalar multiplication, is called the set of **vectors** in *R*^3.\n\nFor the vector *u* = [*x*, *y*, *z*], *x*, *y* and *z* are called the components of *u*.\n\nThe definition of vectors in *R*^3 states that vector addition and scalar multiplication are to be carried out for vectors in space just as for vectors in the plane.

It is only defined for vectors in space.\n\nLet $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$ be two non-zero vectors. The cross or vector product of $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$, written as $\\mu \\times \\gamma$, is defined by\nFigure (a)\nFigure (b)\n\n## Right hand rule\n\n(i) If the fingers of the right hand point along the vector $\\underline{\\mu}$ and then curl towards the vector $\\gamma$, then the thumb will give the direction of $\\underline{\\hat{\\eta}}$ which is $\\underline{\\mu} \\times \\gamma$. It is shown in the figure (a).\n(ii) In figure (b), the right hand rule shows the direction of $\\gamma \\times \\mu$.\n\n### 7.4.1 Derivation of useful results of cross products\n\n(a) By applying the definition of cross product to unit vectors $\\underline{i}, \\underline{j}$ and $\\underline{k}$, we have:\n(a) $\\quad i \\times i=|i||i| \\sin 0^{\\circ} \\underline{\\hat{n}}=0$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\underline{j} \\times \\underline{j}=|j||j| \\sin 0^{\\circ} \\underline{\\hat{n}}=0 \\\\\n& \\underline{k} \\times \\underline{k}=|\\underline{k}||\\underline{k}| \\sin 0^{\\circ} \\underline{\\hat{n}}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(b) $\\quad i \\times \\underline{j}=|i||j| \\sin 90^{\\circ} \\underline{k}=\\underline{k}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\underline{j} \\times \\underline{k}=|j||k| \\sin 90^{\\circ} i=i \\\\\n& \\underline{k} \\times i=|\\underline{k}||\\underline{i}| \\sin 90^{\\circ} \\underline{j}=\\underline{j}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(c) $\\underline{\\mu} \\times \\gamma=|\\underline{\\mu}||\\underline{\\eta}| \\sin \\theta \\underline{\\hat{n}}=|\\underline{\\eta}||\\underline{\\theta}| \\sin (-\\theta) \\underline{\\hat{n}}=-|\\underline{\\eta}||\\underline{\\theta}| \\sin \\theta \\underline{\\hat{n}}$\n$\\Rightarrow \\quad \\underline{\\mu} \\times \\gamma=-\\gamma \\times \\underline{\\mu}$\n(d) $\\underline{\\mu} \\times \\underline{\\mu}=|\\underline{\\mu}||\\underline{\\theta}| \\sin 0^{\\circ} \\underline{\\hat{n}}=0$\nNote: The cross product of $i, j$ and $k$ are written in the cyclic pattern.
